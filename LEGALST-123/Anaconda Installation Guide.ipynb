    "This is a guide to help you properly install and set up Anaconda for the course -- you will want to have this done before you come to the next class so that you will have access to the first lab of the class! Check out the Peer Consulting Office Hours information below if you need additional help at any step.\n",

    "### I. Installation Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choose appropriate operating system and download **Python 3.7 version**\n",
    "![image](./anaconda1.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Follow the installation instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you are a **Windows** user, choose to *also* install **Anaconda Prompt** -- this will be your terminal from which you will activate virtual environments and access your labs.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To verify that Anaconda has been installed, open up your terminal and \\*\\*run the following command: `conda --version`\n",
    "\n",
    "(\\*\\*type the exact command as written and hit enter)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your installation was successful, your message should say `conda` with the version number of your Anaconda. If you error at this point, please reach out to either Aniket or seek help from a Peer Consultant (info below).\n",

    "### II. Set-Up: Creating a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We create virtual environments to use different version of applications and libraries. Virtual environments allow you to use isolated python environments to install different versions of libraries. Here, we will make a new virtual environment called `legal-studies` and show you how to activate/deactive it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Open your Terminal (for Windows, open Anaconda Prompt)\n",
    "2. In your terminal, run the command:\n",
    "    `conda create -n legal-studies python=3 anaconda`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    You've now created your virtual environment!\n",
    "3. To activate this virtual environment, run: \n",
    "    - on Mac or Linux: `source activate legal-studies`\n",
    "    - on Windows: `activate legal-studies`\n",
    "4. To deactivate virtual environment: \n",
    "    - Mac or Linux: `source deactivate`\n",
    "    - Windows: `deactivate`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Remember to always activate your virtual environment first before you install packages or run a notebook! This prevents the potential of crashing your root Python/Anaconda installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### III. Navigating Your Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Run Your First Notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebooks which is what will use throughout this course for all of our labs. In order to run your first notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your terminal (for Windows users, use Anaconda Prompt)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Activate your virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Change your directory to your desired folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Run the command on your terminal: `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your default browser window will open, and you should see all of your files in your specified directory. Here, you can create a new notebook or open an existing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To close the notebook server (and shut down all running notebooks), run the command: `jupyter notebook stop` OR simply hit `Ctrl + c` in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have problems with installation, the lab link can be accessed here: http://datahub.berkeley.edu/user-redirect/interact?account=ds-modules&repo=LEGALST-190&branch=master&path=LEGALST-123/1-18/lab1.ipynb\n",

    "If at any point you ran into trouble with installation or set-up, you can turn to Peer Consultants who hold office hours throughout the week in 1st Floor of Moffitt. Check out the peer consulting office hours at ([linked here](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/peer-consulting)) and get your questions answered/problems solved! \n",
