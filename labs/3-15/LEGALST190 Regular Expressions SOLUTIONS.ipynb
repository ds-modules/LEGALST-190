    "Regular Expressions operations (\"RegEx\") are a very flexible version of the text search function that you find in most text processing software. In those regular search functions, you press `ctrl+F` (or `command+F`) and type in the search phrase you are looking for e.g. \"Congress\". If your software finds an exact match for your search phrase (\"Congress\"), it jumps to its position in the text and you can take it from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking a bit more abstractly about this, \"Congress\" is nothing else than a very specific search. In it, we ask the search function to report the position where it finds a capital \"C\" followed seven lower case letters (\"o\", \"n\", \"g\", \"r\", \"e\",\"s\",\"s\"), all in a specific order. Depending on your text, it may have been sufficient to let your search function look for all words starting with the captial letter \"C\", or for those words starting with \"C\" and ending with \"ess\". This kind of flexibility is exactly what RegEx provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "RegEx is more flexible than the customary search function as it does not restrict you to spell out the literal word, number or phrase you are looking for. Rather, in RegEx you can describe the necessary characteristics for a match. You can enter these characteristics based on rules and special characters that make RegEx what it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are useful in a variety of applications, and can be used in different programs and programming languages. We will start by learning the general components of regular expressions, using a simple online tool, Regex101. Then at the end of the workshop, we'll learn how to use regular expressions to conduct devaluation exploration on the Old Bailey dataset - we will look at how often plaintiffs had the amount they were charged with stealing reduced when they were sentenced by matching valuations in the text such as 'value 8s 6p'.\n",
    "\n",
    "__IT IS IMPORTANT to have an experimental mindset as you go through today's practice problems.__ Practice and curiosity are the keys to success! Each indiviual character expression may output a simple pattern, but you will need to explore different combinations to match more and more complicated sets of strings. Feel free to go beyond what the questions ask and test different expressions as you work through this notebook.\n",
