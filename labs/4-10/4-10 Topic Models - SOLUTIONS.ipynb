    "Along with `gensim`,  we can also use `scikit-learn` to implement a LDA model. Using the `scikit-learn` algorithm is less clear, since a lot of the work is done by the computer. But, by going through the `gensim` algorithm, we now have an idea how LDA works, and using the `scikit-learn` algorithm will be a little more clear. \n",

    "You may be wondering, *why did we do all of that work in the first section when we can just use `scikit-learn` to implement a LDA model?* \n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation to use `gensim` is that you have much more control over how you can implement your model. This is a really big benefit if you want to find topics without having too much overlap, repetition, or inconsistency. For example, with `gensim`, you can tokenize and stem your documents in any way you want. But with `scikit-learn`, you don't have as much control over how you manipulate your data. Another example is the ability to filter your `gensim` dictionary instance, which you will explore later in the last section. If you prefer a more explicit method of implementing a topic model and want command over your data, then `gensim` is a great option.\n",
