70,2015,CAF,"The Head of State of the Transition, Her Excellency Ms. Catherine Samba Panza, was to have spoken to here at the General Assembly personally in order to thank the United Nations for its extremely valuable support to the process of transition in the Central African Republic. Alas, the resurgence of violence since 25 September in the capital, Bangui, has meant that she has had to return home earlier than intended. She has therefore asked me to give her speech as follows.
It is an honour and great pleasure for me to share with the General Assembly the vision that my country has on the major issues facing the world and to report on developments in the situation in the Central African Republic. The serious situation obtaining today in my country means that I must spare addressing international issues in order to call the attention of world leaders to the new tragedy affecting the people of the Central African Republic.
I should like first of all sincerely to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on being elected as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. He may rest assured of the full support of the delegation of my country for the success of this session, which also marks the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations.
I am also grateful to His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, his predecessor, who by his leadership and example conducted the work of the sixty-ninth session and the preparatory work for the current session. My gratitude also goes to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. I should like to encourage him in his constant commitment to peace, security and development in the
22/28 15-29701

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21
world and congratulate him particularly on his personal involvement in endeavours to resolve the crisis in the Central African Republic.
A year ago, the Head of State of Transition outlined before the Assembly (see A/69/PV.15) the tragic situation in my country while appealing to the international community to mobilize and come to the help of the Central African Republic, beset by the indiscriminate and savage violence by non-regulated armed groups. Given the cruelty of the atrocities and heinous crimes hitherto unknown in the history of my country, the United Nations did not hesitate. The international community unanimously committed to support the Transitional Government, which had just been established. That commitment was reflected in the adoption of several resolutions of the Security Council, one being resolution 2149 (2014), authorized the deployment of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA).
Supported by that commitment from the international community, the Head of State of Transition worked to the utmost to establish dialogue among the various protagonists in order together to find the way to social cohesion and stabilization for the country. It was a question of ensuring a peaceful climate, one of confidence, so that we could live together.
The crisis was far-reaching and complex. It required a vigorous and global response, which the Transitional Government alone was not able to provide. In order to break the deadlock, the Transitional Government, with the support of the international community, drew up a road map with the following priorities: the re-establishment of security and the building of peace; humanitarian assistance; the re-establishment of State authority throughout the national territory; the recovery of the economy and the improvement of the management of public finances; and the organization of free, transparent and democratic elections for a return to constitutional order. Considerable progress has been made in 18 months of transition.
Politically, after the signing of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Brazzaville on 23 July 2014, grassroots consultations organized throughout the entire country made it possible to hold a national forum from 4 to 11 May, which brought together all forces in the nation, including the armed groups. That led to the adoption of significant recommendations
and the signing of commitments by the armed groups to renounce violence. The electoral process is taking place normally and the Government has undertaken to organize elections in accordance with the timetable established by the national elections authority, establishing a deadline for the end of December this year. That process is an irreversible one. The people of the Central African Republic are determined to go to the ballot box to choose their leaders democratically.
In 2011, while the country was at peace, the number of registered voters stood at 1,6 million. Today, despite the crisis, the number is 1.59 million registered voters. That shows the desire of the people to return to constitutional order.
As far as security matters go, since the deployment of MINUSCA, on 15 September 2014, until the most recent sad events the situation was becoming progressively more normal throughout the entire country. Bangui began to find once again its charming way of life with the resumption of economic and social activities. While awaiting for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) process to begin, a pre-DDR programme was launched via the cantonment of former armed groups, who were employed in community work.
On the humanitarian front, the situation has once again become alarming since the terrible date of 25 September. The number of internally displaced persons had been considerably reduced, but now we see a horrendous spike, which means that there are now more than 30,000 internally displaced people in Bangui. Nevertheless, the number of refugees has decreased from 1 million in 2014 to about 460,000 since the voluntary return policy. The international community has lent very strong support to the Central African Republic in order to help its people go back home.
In economic terms, the growth rate, which had dropped by 37 per cent at the height of the crisis in 2013, grew by 1.3 per cent in 2014. The forecast for 2015 is of the order of 5.5 per cent. That progress is attributable to the support of the international community, which created the necessary conditions to mobilize domestic resources, as well as the contributions from bilateral and multilateral partners.
After a year of untiring efforts by the Transitional Government and the international community, we were able to state happily a week ago that the bad times were over and the Central African Republic was gradually
15-29701 23/28

A/70/PV.21 30/09/2015
recovering from its travails and taking its place among the community of nations.
Alas, just as we came to tell the United Nations of those encouraging results of the Transition, which is moving to its end with the organization of elections at the end of this year, the enemies of peace once again dealt a harsh blow to the process on 25 September by savage violence, killings and terrible crimes leading to the loss of many human lives and destruction as well as the massive displacement of people.
That situation clearly shows that peace and reconciliation are still tenuous and require strong supported action in order that my country will not once again be drawn into a vicious cycle of violence, challenging the progress made so arduously during the Transition thanks to the determination of the Government and the people and the constant support of the international community. We ask the international community, an in particular the United Nations, to make it possible for there to be a stronger presence in the Central African Republic, stronger action to help to staunch destruction and widespread crime. For 18 months the legitimate aspiration of the people for stability and development has remained dependent on the security situation, which is still very uncertain as proven by the current outbreaks of violence in Bangui.
I am aware that the outbreaks of crisis have multiplied in the world today and that the Organization is facing many challenges on all fronts and resources are diminishing ever more. But remember the thousands of children, women, old people and sick people and other vulnerable groups so hatefully killed in such a cowardly way, raped, humiliated or required to leave their homes to find refuge in unhealthy places under rain without shelter, just because a handful of individuals decided to put into practice their nefarious plans to destabilize an entire country to assuage their hunger for power.
That then is why I call upon the Security Council to reinforce MINUSCA’s mandate to better combat these enemies of peace and give hope once again to the sorely tried people of my country. That is why I demand that the Security Council consider lifting the sanctions regime, particularly regarding the training and equipment of our defence and security forces within the framework of bilateral cooperation with friendly countries ready to help the Central African Republic.
Against that backdrop, speeding up the reform of the security sector, the pre-DDR and DDR efforts
are the immediate absolute priorities as we move towards rebuilding a national multi-ethnic army that is representative of all regions of the country and able to lend its support to the actions of the international forces.
I also remain deeply disturbed by the matter of impunity, which continues despite the sanctions pursuant to Security Council resolutions 2127 (2013) and 2134 (2014), pertaining to certain Central African citizens at the root of the crisis today. The failure to implement the provisions of those resolutions is one of the causes of the lasting violence of armed groups and the violence in our country. That is why the Government has established a special criminal court in order to try all those responsible for mass atrocities and the destruction seen in the country today.
This is the right forum to pay tribute to MINUSCA and to all those who have made their contribution in order to give new hope to the people of the Central African Republic, inter alia, the member countries of the Security Council, the African Union, the European Union, the Economic Community of Central African States, the Central African Monetary and Economic Community, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, France, the United States of America and the Kingdom of Morocco.
This seventieth session of the General Assembly is being held against a backdrop of generalized threats affecting all countries that want to see justice and peace, whether we are talking about Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram or the Islamic State, terrorism remains a threat to the entire world and must grasp the attention of all world leaders, who, regardless of their ideological or religious beliefs, must work to eradicate this scourge.
The Central African Republic is not spared those threats because, in addition to the armed groups slaughtering the civilian population and going unpunished, my country has, for more than a decade, been facing Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army laying waste to the south-east of the country. The porous borders in the north-east and north-west of the country mean that the Central African Republic is a potential sanctuary, indeed a very likely sanctuary, for terrorists in particular from Boko Haram, at present in Nigeria and Cameroon. That is why the re-establishment of security and State authority throughout our country is
24/28 15-29701

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21
of the greatest priority in order to prevent the Central African Republic becoming an area where terrorists can fall back, recruit new members and gain new supplies.
In addition to armed conflict and terrorism we must also face poverty and the HIV/AIDS and Ebola pandemics, which render the situation of the majority of the planet’s people ever more precarious. That requires increased international solidarity among countries a sustained partnership between Governments and civil society to bring about eradication.
Another major challenge we face today is that of climate change. This only exacerbates geographical, social and ecological inequalities, with their sad consequences of poverty, the migration crisis and the reduction of resources for future and current generations. My country, which is part of the Congo Basin, contributes by way of its forests preserving the ecological balance in the world. Nevertheless, we are classified as one of the poorest countries in the world, and therefore one of the most vulnerable.
Our development priorities remain adaptation to the negative impact of climate change by means of support from the international community to gain access for southern hemisphere countries to additional funding and the transfer of technology. In that regard, the outcome of the upcoming meeting to be held in Paris in December will send a strong signal to the decision-makers of the planet to work together to provide future generations with a world where it will be good to live. The Central African Republic strongly supports that process and will participate in the meeting.
Other challenges, such as related to respect for human rights, the rule of law and good governance, are preconditions for peace and lasting security. However, respect of human rights must not be an excuse for impunity. There must be a framework of equitable justice, meaning that those responsible for serious crimes can be held to account.
Respecting human rights also means the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for freedom of expression and the preservation of the territorial integrity of States. In that regard, the Central African Republic remains of the belief that conflict prevention and conflict settlement by peaceful means are the best ways to maintain and ensure international peace and security.
That is why my country continues to support the principle of the political settlement of the question of the Moroccan Sahara within the framework of the guidelines defined by the United Nations. My country welcomes the encouraging positions of the Security Council expressed through the several resolutions that have been adopted since 2007, which lay down a credible basis for a political settlement, one mutually acceptable to the various parties. The Central African Republic remains firmly committed to this process under the aegis of the United Nations.
The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations provides us with an opportunity to think about reforming the organs of the Organization to adapt them to the realities of today’s world. We therefore have to move towards a new way to achieve world peace and security with a reform of the principal organ, the Security Council, to make it more democratic and more representative of the various continents, as well as more accessible to the countries of the South. The Central African Republic supports the process of such reform, which will mean that it will prove easier for the United Nations to meet the expectations of countries when it comes to responding to international issues. My country also calls for limiting the use of the veto in situations of conflict or disaster where there are risks of mass crimes and crimes against humanity. My country strongly supports the initiative of France and Mexico in that regard.
I wish to express the hope that this seventieth session of the General Assembly will be a historic occasion on which world leaders will unanimously and bravely enter into a commitment to revitalize the Organization with the same determination as their forebears 70 years ago.
"
70,2015,TON,"I congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and assure him of our full support. I should also thank his predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his excellent work, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership.
I stand before the Assembly humbled by the words of His Holiness Pope Francis as he addressed this body mere days ago (see A/70/PV.3). I am humbled because in his address His Holiness the Pope spoke directly to those political issues that occupy us all — those issues that we might easily resolve if only we had more political commitment and more political will. But His Holiness the Pope spoke in a language higher than that of politics — one of morality and of moral imperative. These are principles and ideals that have guided me throughout my life.
In this Hall, we are often guilty of an abstraction we call “political will”, the political will to address climate change, to be careful stewards of our environment, and to address devastating global inequalities in development. This abstraction distracts us. It distracts
us from our need for moral commitment and for moral courage. It is this language of morality that speaks to the privileged with the imperative “you must leave no one behind”. It is in this spirit of moral commitment that I speak to the work my Government has undertaken to serve the underserved and to meet our aspirations as they are presently embodied in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).
As the first democratically elected representative of the people to the rank of Prime Minister in my country, I am particularly pleased with the inclusion of Sustainable Development Goal 16 related to building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. That Goal relates to the notion of good governance — the guiding principle of my Government under our democracy, fit for purpose, and a principle that I have always demanded of any Government of the day in Tonga throughout my almost 30-year career in politics.
Indeed, it is my Government’s mantra that good governance, transparency, accountability and law and order will drive all other development goals of a country. As such, my Government is committing time and resources to strengthening governing institutions through measures such as the establishment of an anti-corruption commission, and considering approaches to removing other challenges and constraints on the sustainable development of the country, such as cultural perceptions and religious dogmas.
The objectives of good governance, effective accountable and inclusive institutions are impossible to meet without full support for the human rights of all peoples living in areas of conflict throughout the world, including in the Pacific islands. Tonga reiterates its call for the root causes of such conflicts to be resolved by peaceful means, and in full recognition of the principle of the sovereignty of States.
With the Agenda adopted, the central challenge for us at this seventieth session of the General Assembly is to translate these aspirations into concrete actions. Our final Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) report 2015 revealed that the achievement in the areas of health and education has helped to maintain Tonga’s position in the Human Development Index. Our people now enjoy an acceptable standard of quality health service, and children and young people are able to go to school and advance to higher education. We are pleased to note that the 14 new priorities for Tonga for the next 15 years, as set out in our final MDGs report,
14/23 15-29595

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18
are all included in the 17 Goals of the 2030 Agenda for 2030: Goal 1, no poverty; Goal 3, good health and well-being; Goal 4, quality education; Goal 5, gender equality; Goal 8, decent work and economic growth; Goal 9, industry, innovation and infrastructure; Goal 10, reduce inequalities; Goal 15, life on land; and Goal 17, partnership for the Goals.
Therefore, I confirm here again my Government’s full support for the Agenda and, with the assistance of development partners, we will do our utmost to achieve them by 2030. We in Tonga had followed the best practice of the MDGs journey. It was an incredible learning experience for my country and we will adopt these best practices towards our implementation of the new Development Goals and the Agenda as a whole.
Tonga, as a Pacific small island developing State (SIDS), must meet the goals on oceans and seas and climate change, to ensure access to affordable and sustainable energy for all, and the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development. Tonga is also aided by the priorities and commitments set out in the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway, which represents an international commitment to genuine and durable partnerships. That was advanced by this year’s SIDS partnership dialogue, the creation of a SIDS Partnership Framework, and in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit assessment of United Nations system support for SIDS. The relationship between the Samoa Pathway and the 2030 Agenda is now well established, and we must maintain the links between these documents as we review our progress.
The Samoa Pathway is also significant for its central recognition that the challenges that islands such as Tonga face are different and therefore qualify our country as a special sustainable development case in need of targeted and tailored support. This message was reaffirmed in the discussion on the means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda, it having been advanced, as can be clearly seen, in the outcome document of the third International Conference on Financing for Development, which makes mention of SIDS in 25 paragraphs.
A key piece of the development agenda remains outstanding as we look forward to the successful conclusion of negotiations on a climate agreement in Paris at the end of this year. That agreement must reaffirm the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to stabilize
greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere. Tonga remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters, which continue to increase in frequency and destructiveness. Climate change continues to pose an irreversible threat to our people, our society, our livelihoods and our natural environment.
In this regard, we welcome the dialogue that has taken place in the Security Council and that to be held at a side event to be hosted by the Foreign Ministers of France and Germany tomorrow afternoon, touching upon the security implications of climate change, and support recognition of the links between our climate and international peace and security. We reaffirm our support for the call on the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative on climate and security to thoroughly research and report on those links.
Tonga’s vulnerability to natural disasters re-emphasizes the SIDS special case for sustainable development, and such vulnerabilities should therefore be factored into development finance calculations designed to assist SIDS. Currently, the use of gross domestic product per capita as the basis for determining the access of SIDS to development finance should be replaced by a comprehensive approach that recognizes our vulnerability to natural disaster. That move will save Tonga from increasing its indebtedness in obtaining funds from multilateral institutions for reconstruction in the wake of a cyclone. Currently, Tonga accesses these funds under the condition of a 50 per cent grant and a 50 per cent credit. We therefore support the proposal for adopting a new index reflective of our specific and unique national development characteristics.
We remain thoroughly committed to the management and conservation of our ocean and seas. This year, Tonga commenced its term on the Council of the International Seabed Authority. At home, we have enacted legislation related to seabed mining activities within our national jurisdiction under the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
We remain committed to the conservation and sustainable use of resources in areas beyond the national jurisdiction and fully support ongoing efforts towards an instrument regarding the same. We therefore welcomed the first meeting of the Pacific Ocean Alliance in May, under the auspices of the Office of the Pacific Ocean Commissioner of the Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji, to discuss the positions of Governments, the private sector and civil society on the new UNCLOS implementing
15-29595 15/23

A/70/PV.18 29/09/2015
agreement on marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Within our exclusive economic zone, we continue to combat the problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. In welcoming the adoption of Sustainable Development Goal 14 on the oceans and seas, we support the proposed triennial United Nations ocean and seas conference to drive progress on the goal.
As we work to translate our new Agenda into action, we recognize that the development system of the United Nations must adapt to suit our new priorities. We are supportive of efforts to ensure that the United Nations is fit for purpose to implement the 2030 Agenda. We look forward to continued dialogue on longer-term positioning of the United Nations development system. In the same vein, Tonga is supportive of continued efforts to reform the Security Council through an intergovernmental process in the pursuit of a more representative and inclusive body, reflective of and in line with today’s realities.
Finally, most of us have come a long way looking with hope for solutions. Our political priorities must not distract us from the call so well embodied in the 2030 Agenda to leave no one behind. I re-emphasize that this call speaks to us as leaders to work together against injustice and cruel violations of human rights and dignity, as in the case of West Papuan Melanesia in the Pacific; this is within our power. It is a choice that those with power and privilege can make. The United Nations has a duty to closely follow up this West Papua case and take the necessary action to stop these brutal and inhuman activities.
We leaders must rise to a higher moral order beyond interests and be guided by what is fair and justiciable to all. I am concerned that the message delivered by His Holiness Pope Francis and other world leaders we have heard in the past few days may not have been well and truly heard. We have an obligation, a duty, and I echo the challenge. We must meet this moral obligation internationally, regionally and nationally, or else we will be left behind.
"
70,2015,AGO,"At the outset, on behalf of the President of Angola, Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, the outgoing President, on the capable manner in which he led the work of the Assembly at the sixty-ninth session. In addition, I commend the Secretary-General for his continued commitment to finding solutions to the complex issues that trouble the international community.
The objective of the San Francisco Conference was to build a world based on international law and to seek peaceful solutions to international disputes. Over the course of 70 years, we have seen progress and setbacks. Remarkable progress has been made in the area of decolonization, which is reflected in the number of countries that now constitute the United Nations family. However, there has been no success with regard to collective security, an issue that led to the creation of the United Nations and that remains at the heart of its concerns. We must reflect together on the role and future of the United Nations. We need an Organization capable of promoting peace and international security, of acting quickly and effectively in conflict situations, and of addressing current and emerging challenges.
By adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), States Members of the United Nations reaffirmed as absolute priorities the eradication of poverty and hunger, the promotion of social and economic development, the protection of the rights of all, gender equality, women’s empowerment, the environment, access to quality services and special attention to vulnerable groups.
The 2030 Agenda reasserts the principle of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development that it is possible to promote global and sustainable development and establishes universal Goals that highlight the need for cooperation among peoples and a common path for humankind. It calls for a global partnership and for commitments from all parties to mitigating the adverse consequences of climate change, eradicating poverty and extreme poverty, and creating opportunities for all. I reiterate
Angola’s commitment to taking appropriate measures to strengthen the Organization’s development agenda.
In the near future, the United Nations will also be involved in the review of three very important processes: women and peace and security, peacekeeping operations and the peacebuilding architecture.
As I stated before, the ideal that guided the creation of the United Nations 70 years ago — to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war — has not yet been achieved. People around the world expect the leaders of the 193 nations represented here to join in a collective effort to find appropriate solutions to the serious and multiple challenges that the people of the world face. As we commemorate this anniversary, we bear in mind the role and responsibilities of the United Nations as the pre-eminent forum for finding solutions to international problems, preserving peace, strengthening collective security and renouncing the use of force in international relations, respecting the sovereignty of States, defending and promoting human rights and reaffirming the rule of law as a fundamental principle of the international system.
This occasion should provide an additional incentive to accelerate reforms aimed at revitalizing the United Nations system, in particular the Security Council, by extending the number of its permanent and non-permanent members, thereby making this body more representative and better equipped to address the challenges and opportunities that the world faces. Angola reaffirms the right of the African continent to be represented among the permanent members of the Security Council.
The forced displacement of thousands of human beings presents a heartbreaking picture of human degradation that offends human dignity. It requires an immediate and comprehensive response by the international community.
In the coming month of November, Angola will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of its national independence in an environment of peace, tolerance and reconciliation — a direct result of the will of the Angolan people to work together to achieve higher levels of economic growth and greater social inclusion, progress and well-being for all in a more democratic, prosperous and modern country.
Despite the adverse global environment, the Government of Angola remains committed to sustained growth. To that end, it is implementing its national
14/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
development plan, which aims to rehabilitate and modernize economic and social infrastructure, promote public and private investment, and improve vocational and skills training and human resources management.
The rise in terrorist activities perpetrated by extremist groups in Africa and elsewhere in the world is a serious security problem and one that calls for a global coalition to combat this scourge. The creation of the Multinational Joint Task Force, involving the countries of the Lake Chad Basin and Benin, is an example of the sort of collective response that deserves the support of the international community in order to purge the African continent of the terrorism that has caused such enormous suffering to its people.
The situation in the Central African Republic remains a challenge from the point of view of political and socioeconomic stability and domestic security. Angola supports the efforts of the transitional Government to restore public order and restructure State institutions and encourages all the parties to respect the commitments made in the Bangui Forum as a fundamental prerequisite for attaining an inclusive, peaceful and transparent electoral process.
We welcome the recent compromise reached between the Government of South Sudan and the armed opposition, mediated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and other international partners, to resolve the crisis plaguing the country. We encourage the parties to the Agreement to honour their commitments and the international community to maintain its support for the peace process.
In Guinea-Bissau, with the institutional crisis now overcome, recent political developments augur well for economic growth and political and social stabilization. We appeal to all Guinean political and social actors to display the utmost sense of responsibility, and we urge the international community to continue to fulfil the promises made at the donors’ conference in Brussels.
The question of Western Sahara continues to concern us, in view of the need for the Saharan people to exercise their right to self-determination. We call on the parties to continue negotiations and to find a mutually acceptable solution within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant Security Council resolutions.
We are concerned about the business-as-usual mindset that prevails in the process of finding a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We advocate a
resumption of negotiations leading to a lasting solution, based on two States living side by side in peace and security.
The conflicts in Libya, Syria and Iraq require fast responses, given the serious humanitarian consequences resulting from them. The causes of these conflicts lie in the serious violations of the basic rights of the people of these countries and in external interference, with attempted coups or changes of regime and the artificial imposition of democracy from outside having tragic and disastrous consequences.
Angola warmly welcomes the agreement concluded by the six Powers and the European Union with the Islamic Republic of Iran on the Iranian nuclear programme. That outcome is evidence that any dispute, however difficult and complex, may have a political solution and is particularly notable in the case of a region where diplomacy has, in recent decades, been systematically passed over.
Angola is closely following the normalization of the diplomatic relations between the United States of America and Cuba, which is a welcome development. However, Angola emphasizes the need to put an end to the economic, financial and commercial embargo against Cuba, which limits the right of the Cuban people to development and is contrary to the principles and rules of international law.
The Republic of Angola currently holds the presidency of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and has been engaged in seeking solutions to the problems affecting the region, both bilaterally and multilaterally, as well as in the Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council. In this context, we reiterate our determination to continue to support and promote dialogue, peace, security and stability in Central Africa and throughout the Great Lakes region.
Aware of its responsibilities in an international context that is becoming increasingly fluid and complex, and aware of the security challenges that the States bordering the Gulf of Guinea face, the Angolan Government, with the support of the United States of America and Italy, will host an international conference on maritime and energy security in the coming days in Luanda in order to contribute to a response to threats of terrorism and piracy in the Gulf of Guinea.
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humankind. For this reason, adopting a protocol
15-29658 15/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
to govern the global action to protect the climate system at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is of the highest importance. This agreement should include a commitment to limiting the increase in average global temperatures to 1.5°C by the end of the century. Likewise, the new agreement must include models of sharing enabling tools to protect the right to development and strengthen resilience in developing countries.
Finally, I wish to reaffirm the importance that my country places on the role of multilateralism in solving global problems by finding realistic and bold solutions through concertation, in accordance with a logic of shared responsibilities and benefits and in fulfilment of the legitimate interests of all, We call on all Member States to renew their confidence in the ability of the United Nations to strengthen international dialogue as a key element of the culture of peace, respect for differences between peoples and conflict prevention, which are the very foundations of the progress and development to which all the peoples of the world are entitled.
"
70,2015,LAO,"At the outset, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the seventieth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that, with his extensive diplomatic experience, he will guide this session with great success. I would like to assure him of our full support and cooperation in the discharge of his noble duties. I would also like to sincerely commend His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa for his successful completion of his tenure as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.
This year marks the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations since its establishment following the Second World War. Its main objectives are to promote international peace and security and development cooperation, aimed at ensuring that all humankind lives in peace and in an environment conducive to
12/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
development. Despite the conflicts and challenges that have occurred in different parts of the world, in general peace, security and development cooperation among all nations remain the prevailing trends of this era. That has been an important achievement of the United Nations in fulfilling its mandate enshrined in its Charter.
Nevertheless, the international environment continues to face numerous challenges, such as armed conflicts, terrorism, poverty and hunger, infectious diseases, climate change and natural disasters, which have in turn posed major threats to peace and development. I am therefore of the view that we must enhance our political will, mutual assistance and cooperation under the banner of the United Nations in order to collectively address the challenges facing us. To that end, the United Nations must improve its working methods. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic hopes that, on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations this year, the international community will collectively make serious efforts to conduct a comprehensive reform of the Organization so that it can respond to emerging challenges in a more effective manner.
I take this opportunity to welcome the successful conclusion a few days ago of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, at which the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) was adopted with a view to further addressing the major challenges the world faces today, including any Millennium Development Goals that have yet to be met. Indeed, the new development Agenda is the outcome of open and inclusive intergovernmental negotiations. If we are to achieve the set Goals and targets within the next 15 years, we need to honour our political commitment to strengthening global partnership and cooperation at all possible levels.
Conflicts are being waged today in many regions of the world, which have caused major concern for the international community. It is therefore important to find solutions and to restore peace and development to those regions. In that context, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has consistently supported the peaceful settlement of conflicts. I therefore praise all parties concerned for reaching an agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme, which is of historic significance. It is testimony to the value of dialogue as the best way to address a conflict, which should be taken as a model for resolving hot issues globally.
In addition, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has always hoped that the issue of Palestine, which has been stalled for many decades, will be resolved through peaceful means by the parties concerned with a view to creating two independent States, Palestine and Israel, living side by side in peace, based on the Arab Peace Initiative, and within recognized borders, as stipulated in the relevant Security Council resolutions. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic therefore urges the international community to redouble its efforts to help restore Palestine to normalcy as soon as possible.
In the era of interdependence, cooperation and engagement are key factors for peaceful coexistence and mutual benefit. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic welcomes the recent re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba, which has opened a new chapter in the history of relations between the two countries, which had been at a standstill for many years. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic hopes that the re-established relations will be further enhanced, leading to an end of the embargo and thereby bringing genuine benefits to the people of the two nations, the region and the world as a whole.
Climate change and severe natural disasters, which are occurring more frequently, have had a huge impact on the development of countries, especially the developing and least developed countries, which are most vulnerable due to their limited infrastructure and insufficient technological, financial and human resources to respond to and address those phenomena. It is therefore incumbent upon the international community to help such vulnerable countries through, among other things, long-term capacity-building to tackle such challenges. We hope that the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris later this year, will be able to adopt various measures to address climate change in the coming years.
The South-East Asian region, which is now in the process of economic integration through the various cooperation frameworks of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with a view to building an ASEAN community by the end of this year, has continued to enjoy peace, stability and constant economic growth. ASEAN has broadened its external relations with different countries and regional groups at various levels, as well as with the United Nations.

In 2016, the first year of the ASEAN community, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic will have the honour to chair ASEAN for the second time. I hope that the international community, especially the ASEAN dialogue partners, will continue to support ASEAN- led mechanisms, in which ASEAN plays a central role, so that it can become a community based on the ASEAN way and continue to be a regional grouping that contributes to the maintenance of peace and enhancement of cooperation with other regions and the world at large.
This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Over the past four decades, we have gone through a period of healing the wounds of war and advancing our national development through the implementation of five-year national socioeconomic development plans, especially the seventh five-year plan for 2011-2015, which will be completed by the end of this year. The achievements of the past 40 years can be attributed to many factors, but the most crucial have been political stability and social order, which have provided a conducive environment for economic growth and steadily improved the livelihood of the people.
The Lao Government has maintained its tireless political will to fight poverty, create benchmarks for raising the country’s status from that of least developed country, and pursue the path of sustainable development through a three-level development programme known as sam sang, which identifies provinces as strategic entities, districts as comprehensively strengthened entities and villages as development entities. The programme will strengthen my country’s cooperation with development partners and pave the way for the industrialization and modernization of the country. Indeed, we are moving in the right direction in our national development.
In addition, in the coming months, coinciding with the eighth five-year national socioeconomic development plan for 2016-2020, the Lao Government will adopt a 10-year socioeconomic development strategy for 2016-2025 and the Vision 2030 programme. Nevertheless, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic will undoubtedly continue to face numerous challenges in undergoing socioeconomic development. Those include, among others, the impact of the regional and global economic and financial crises and natural disasters. I therefore call on our development partners and the international community to maintain their
support for the Lao People’s Democratic Republic so that we can achieve our sustainable development foals in the coming years.
Although the Indochina War ended four decades ago, the legacy of that war continues to pose serious obstacles to our national development, especially to agriculture, employment, infrastructure development and investment programmes in areas that remain contaminated by unexploded ordinance. Removing those remnants of war will take a long time and require considerable resources. Aware of that serious impact, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has actively promoted the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), which can prevent the further victimization of humankind.
Earlier this month, the First Review Conference to the Convention on Cluster Munitions was held in Croatia to take stock of the progress and shortcomings in the implementation of that important Convention. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic takes this opportunity to call upon those countries that are not yet party to the CCM to accede to that universal Convention. At the same time, we encourage friendly countries and international organizations to continue to provide funding and technical support in that endeavour.
This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of Laos as a State Member of the United Nations. Throughout the years, we have actively participated in the work of the United Nations in various areas. Moreover, cooperation between the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and the United Nations has steadily grown. The financial and technical support that have been provided by United Nations agencies, funds and programmes have all contributed significantly to the socioeconomic development of our country. We hope that such valuable support and cooperation will continue in the coming years.
The Lao People’s Democratic Republic attaches great importance to promoting and protecting human rights and has become State party to seven of the main international human rights instruments. In its desire to contribute to the work of the Human Rights Council, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has presented its candidature for membership to the Human Rights Council for the period 2016-2018. We look forward to receiving the support of Members States and the opportunity to contribute to the work of the Human Rights Council.

This year is of great historical significance to the international community, especially because of the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). I believe that it will mark an important milestone in realizing the aspiration of humankind to live in peace, security, prosperity and social justice, while protecting the environment and promoting the sustainable development towards a brighter future for current and future generations. To that end, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic will contribute actively to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets that world leaders adopted a few days ago.

70,2015,BRN,"First of all, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mogens Lykketoft on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and wish him much success. I also extend my thanks to the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his valuable contribution to the work of the Organization, as well as my best wishes for his future endeavours. I would also like to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his able leadership, as well as the United Nations agencies for their active engagement with Member States.
It gives me great pleasure to be here as we commemorate together the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the Organization. This is indeed a historic occasion to celebrate our achievements, as well as to reflect on matters that require our urgent action.
The existence of the United Nations for the past 70 years is a testament to its relevance. It has become the world body that we look up to, our point of reference on all aspects of humankind, and it has no equal. It was established in 1945 in the wake of the mass destruction brought about by the Second World War, and the need to restore peace and security was its main focus. Today, its mandate has grown hugely to include emerging challenges and evolving threats, such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, climate change, pandemic diseases and terrorism and violent extremism. As part of a comprehensive global mandate, it has also been tasked with addressing multidimensional socioeconomic matters.
We recognize that the United Nations is not a panacea for all of the world’s woes, but that has not diminished its overall success. On that note, we commend the role played by all of the United Nations agencies and the Organization’s development work aimed at improving people’s lives around the world.
One profound achievement is in the containment of pandemic diseases, which pose serious threats to the world’s population. In 1980, the World Health Organization succeeded in completely eradicating smallpox and, more recently, it worked with affected countries to contain the breakout of the Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola.
Over the years, we have seen how our humanitarian workers and peacekeepers risk their lives to carry out the work of the United Nations, with some losing their lives in the course of their noble work. Those brave individuals will always deserve our highest respect for their commitment and sacrifice to make our world a safer place.
With a membership of 193 States, the expectations will inevitably be high for the effectiveness of the Organization in addressing the ever-increasing issues that affect the lives of the people we represent. I am therefore pleased that our new post-2015 development agenda, contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (see resolution 70/1), embraces most, if not all, of those concerns. Its inclusiveness signifies the trust and faith that we have in our Organization. It is therefore important that we fulfil our national and collective responsibilities to implement the new Agenda and realize our peoples’ hopes and dreams for a better life.

In 1984, Brunei Darussalam’s admission into the United Nations signified a global endorsement of its sovereignty and territorial integrity as a fully independent nation. Since then, we have benefited extensively from that membership. The United Nations has provided us with a platform for enhancing our bilateral and multilateral relations with our friends and partners. Through the United Nations, we have also been able to demonstrate our unwavering commitment to the maintenance of peace, stability and development. Brunei Darussalam firmly believes that tolerance, compassion and social harmony have been essential for the lasting peace and security that our close-knit community has been enjoying to this day. Such values have been the foundation of our country’s stability and prosperity, which has provided an enabling environment for development.
In our region, the shared principles of the member States of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), namely, territorial integrity, non-interference, consensus, the rule of law and good governance, guide our efforts to achieve closer cooperation for peace, stability and prosperity. That national and regional experience represents our contribution to the United Nations as part of the multilateral process. And it is through the United Nations that I envision the creation of a caring global community with similar values and principles that can unleash our potential to work and achieve greater things together. In order to bring us closer together and foster greater understanding and empathy with one another, we should nurture more cultural exchanges, which would enable us to live as a family of nations. In that way, we might be able to avert new conflicts and better utilize the resources of socioeconomic development.
According to the World Bank, the average cost of civil war is equivalent to more than 30 years of gross domestic product growth for a medium-size developing country. The cost of peacekeeping during and after a civil war is also extremely high and, above all, there is the loss of lives, which cannot be measured. Preventive diplomacy is therefore a cost-effective means of addressing conflicts, and certainly an integral part of conflict prevention efforts. It is a long-term process and a worthwhile investment, in which the United Nations has made some headway. We highly value the important work of the good offices of the Secretary-General, the Special Envoys and the resident political missions as
some of the key tools of preventive diplomacy. However, more can be done to enhance conflict prevention.
If we wish to move forward, the Secretary-General’s view — and I agree — is that we have to strengthen the partnerships between the United Nations and regional or subregional organizations. Such organizations have a unique influence and easy access to crisis situations in their respective regions, and the United Nations should be able to leverage that strength to defuse tension before it escalates into conflicts. Through the ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN member States, along with other member participants, have long worked together to create an atmosphere of trust and confidence. Two years ago, they adopted a workplan on preventive diplomacy, and its implementation has made significant progress and contributed towards the maintenance of peace and security in the region. I wish to take this opportunity to thank the United Nations for providing coaching and training programmes to help ASEAN implement that plan. I believe that our Organization is in the best position to promote the necessary cooperation and partnerships based on mutual respect, understanding and tolerance, which can prevent wars and conflicts, religious persecution, violent ideological confrontation and terrorism.
Since our last gathering, we have witnessed the tragic loss of life caused by inhumane terrorist acts in various parts of the world. Such acts are unacceptable, and we join others in condemning terrorism and in totally rejecting extremism and radicalism. We reiterate our support for all efforts by the international community to prevent and eliminate all forms of terrorism. In that regard, we also support intercultural dialogue among peoples of different religions, cultures and initiatives, such as the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, the Global Movement of Moderates, the King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue, World against Violence and Violent Extremism, and the Summit on Countering Violent Extremism.
It is crucial that we address the root causes of terrorism and extremism in a comprehensive manner. We need to ensure that irresponsible parties do not exploit the despair and suffering of others to fuel their own extremist agendas. That is why we need to resolve the plight of our Palestinian brothers and sisters, an issue that remains at the core of the conflict in the Middle East. For over 60 years, Palestinians have struggled to achieve self-determination. A lasting
15-29562 25/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
peaceful solution is long overdue. In that regard, I am pleased to see that Palestine has been accepted as a member in various international bodies. That has been reflected in the General Assembly’s historic decision to allow the flag of Palestine to fly proudly with the flags of other sovereign and independent nations of this world body. Those are all positive developments that should contribute to obtaining the recognition of Palestinian statehood.
I wish to reiterate our commitment to continuing to work with others to ensure that the United Nations remains a strong force for peace, security and human rights. After all, the success of our Organization lies in our own collective efforts, which constitute the true strength of this Organization.
"
70,2015,BGR,"Allow me to congratulate you, Mr. President, on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I also wish to extend my sincere gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa for his work as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.
Today, we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of our unique Organization. We reflect on what we have accomplished, but also on what we have fallen short of achieving. It is also a time to map the way ahead. The Secretary-General has announced “Strong United Nations. Better World.” as the slogan for this year’s anniversary. But are we stronger as a community? Are we shaping a better world for our children? We are living in turbulent times. The number of crises around the world is at a record high with failing States, frozen
conflicts, wars and terrorism creating insecurity around Europe. Our citizens feel that instability. They expect politicians to act boldly, to solve and not to deepen the crises.
The ongoing conflicts in Syria, the Middle East and North Africa are threatening the lives of millions. The rising extremism that no borders can contain is a serious challenge to the international community. The degrading humanitarian situation in several conflict zones has forced millions of people to leave their homes, pack their whole lives into a suitcase and embark on a perilous, sometimes even deadly journey to safety. Hundreds of thousands of people are at Europe’s doorstep, reaching out for a helping hand, struggling and fighting for the right to live. As a result, nationalistic parties that feed on people’s fears have seized the day and are gaining momentum. Hate speech, racism, xenophobia, populism and aggressive nationalism are again on the rise.
All of those challenges transcend national borders and call upon us to act with resolve on a global scale. Robert Schuman, called “the Father of Europe” as one of the founding fathers of the European Union and the greatest peace projects the world has ever seen, stated in the Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950: “World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it.” We should not wait for the crises to appear on our television screens to prompt us to act. It is high time that we acted together to address the causes, not the consequences.
Peace is not just the absence of war. Peace is human rights. Peace is the rule of law. Peace is rules that apply to everyone, including global and regional Powers. Security, development, human rights and the rule of law are interdependent and mutually reinforcing universal values. They are the pillars of the United Nations. Every crisis can be traced back to an initial phase when someone violated the law and human rights. To prevent future crises, a United Nations early-warning crisis detection system needs to be set up to safeguard the rule of law and human rights.
Poverty, inequalities and environmental degradation are issues that require our attention. Bulgaria welcomes the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and is fully committed to its implementation. For the first time in the history of humankind, people are at the very heart of a development agenda that leaves no one behind. This truly transformative Agenda reflects the complexity of the challenges we face today. It takes into consideration the right of every individual to live in dignity and prosperity and ensures the equal participation of all sections of society.
Climate change is a serious problem. Its impact continues to cause more disparities and conflicts. Climate change negotiations have entered a critical stage. 2015 is a landmark year — we have an opportunity to end two decades of intense climate negotiations and begin a new era through the adoption of a global, legally binding protocol in Paris in December. My country will contribute to the successful finalization of that process.
Women’s participation in all aspects of social and political life still remains a major challenge in many parts of the world. Development will never be truly sustainable and lasting peace will never be achieved, if half of the world’s population is excluded. Gender equality is an absolute necessity for the full realization of human rights and the functioning of democracy.
Today, the international community faces a deteriorating global security environment, characterized by a rising number of civil wars, growing extremism and an increased number of humanitarian crises. A renewed focus on conflict prevention is needed. In the five years since its beginning, the conflict in Syria has come to represent a major threat to international peace and security. The presence of Daesh in the region has become a key obstacle to a political settlement in Syria and a serious risk to the stability and the territorial
integrity of Iraq. The most recent terrorist attacks in Egypt, Tunisia, Kuwait and Turkey have shown that violent extremism and radicalization transcend national borders.
Joint action by the international community in the fight against violent extremism is crucial. The United Nations is the best platform for managing and coordinating international efforts. We need Governments and law enforcement institutions to cooperate closely with regional organizations, civil society, local communities, media and the private sector in order to ensure durable and viable solutions. On a national level, we should adopt policies and measures that can prevent the radicalization of marginalized groups and ensure their better integration in society.
As long as the conflict in Syria continues, the refugee crisis will not subside. The efforts of the entire international community should focus on ending hostilities in conflict zones and supporting institution building, the rule of law and respect for human rights. The role of neighbouring States is also of great importance.
Europe is currently focused on the establishment of a solidarity scheme that will allow the fair relocation and resettlement of refugees among all Member States. We need to establish an appropriate mechanism that can distinguish those in need from those just looking for a better life. The migrant crisis is a security concern. Apart from the fear of infiltration by extremists on European soil, the issue of illegal human trafficking, which requires our urgent attention and concerted action, has again been raised.
Given the unprecedented migratory flow towards Europe, the European Union (EU) has to demonstrate solidarity and responsibility. In the EU, we need not just to address the crisis but to solve it in a manner guided by European unity and our common desire for a peaceful and free Europe. The European Union represents the largest area of human rights, peace and democracy in the world. It is a family that stands together.
The international community was deeply shocked by the deliberate destruction of world cultural heritage sites in Syria and Iraq by terrorists. That is not only a cultural tragedy, but a severe blow to human civilization. Societies without ethics and values, without morals and culture, have no future. In that respect, I would like to underline UNESCO’s important role in the protection
2/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
of cultural heritage sites in armed conflicts and in the prevention of illegal trafficking in cultural artefacts.
There is a clear need to revitalize the Middle East peace process. Bulgaria fully supports the Secretary- General’s Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Mr. Nickolay Mladenov, in his challenging mission. My country reaffirms its position that the United States-led formula, the two-State solution, is the realistic, just and lasting way to settle the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.
Bulgaria has consistently supported diplomacy as the only way to resolve the issue of the Iranian nuclear programme. We welcome the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and hope that all the measures agreed therein will be fully implemented in a timely fashion.
This year we celebrate 70 years since the end of the Second World War. We remember all the innocent lives that perished in the death camps of the Holocaust. There will always be people who will try to justify the killing of innocents in the name of a cause they consider worthy. We should never forget that we are all born equal, born in peace to live in peace and strive for peace. I remember the words of the young Muslim man from Mali, Lassana Bathily, who saved several innocent lives during the hostage crisis earlier this year in Paris:
“We are brothers. It is not a question of Jews, Christians or Muslims. We are all in the same boat and we have to help one another.”
Today we need active citizens who care for human rights. As President, I stand behind Bulgarian civil society in their demands that State institutions be transparent and efficient. I am proud of the example Bulgarian civil society set in 1943 by saving all 48,000 Bulgarian Jews from the Nazi camps. Unfortunately, Bulgaria was not in a position to do the same for the Jewish people from northern Greece and parts of Yugoslavia, as they were not Bulgarian citizens. We deeply mourn the loss of their lives, as well as all the victims of the Holocaust, whom we will always remember.
Temples of different religions — an Orthodox church, a mosque, a synagogue and a Catholic cathedral — are located just across from my office, in the very heart of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. They have coexisted peacefully, some of them for centuries. That is a great example of tolerance, wisdom and respect for
diversity. And it is up to all of us to shape the world we live in with tolerance and humanism.
The annexation of Crimea was a blatant violation of international law and its principles. Bulgaria stands firmly behind Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. For us, Crimea is Ukraine and Ukraine is Europe. My country condemns any attempts to further destabilize Ukraine. The full implementation of the Minsk Agreements is essential. We call on all stakeholders to engage constructively in a political dialogue in order to reach a just political solution.
The Bulgarian Chairmanship-in-Office of the South-East European Cooperation Process will work for the adoption of a Joint Declaration to reaffirm the principle of the inviolability of national borders in the Balkans. We want borders not to be moved, but to fall. Enhanced regional cooperation and the European integration of all the countries in the region is our ultimate goal.
Among the eight Secretary-Generals of the United Nations, all of them men, a national from the Group of Eastern European States has never been appointed. The recently adopted resolution 69/321 (2015) stresses the need to ensure equal and fair distribution based on gender and geographical balance, while meeting the highest possible requirements for the appointment of the Secretary-General. The time has come for a woman from Eastern Europe to be entrusted with the highest position in the Secretariat. Once a joint letter by the Presidents of the General Assembly and the Security Council, as envisaged in the resolution, starts the formal process for soliciting candidates for Secretary-General, Bulgaria stands ready to nominate the candidate who will be the best fit for the post. That will be a person of excellence, with extensive experience in international relations, with great interpersonal skills, an efficient manager and communicator, a true leader.
"
70,2015,MHL,"I bring the General Assembly the warm greetings of “Yokwe” from the people and nation of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer small island States a powerful tool with which to shape and adjust our own domestic strategies. The international community has spoken, and a changing world is mapping a visionary landscape that reaches into the distant years that have too rarely been part of our own national discussions — beyond 2020, beyond 2023, towards 2030 and even farther, to the middle of the century.
In adopting the SDGs, the Marshall Islands cannot afford a set-it-and-forget-it mentality, which has too often marked past international efforts. We now have a powerful opportunity in which to merge recent national planning improvements and construct an architecture for measuring progress and pinpointing gaps. Such gaps are not only our own, but also those of our partners. Too often, we have — all of us — operated with goodwill, but without accountability for our collective performance. Our post-2023 national trust fund deserves a strong support system and also represents an opportunity, if we use it, to work towards specific goals and benchmarks. If we can jointly harness our national and global priorities, if we can commit our own efforts and national resources, however small they may be right now, and if our close partners can work with us to restructure assistance-delivery to target the SDGs, then my nation too can climb the development ladder.
I welcome the establishment of a comprehensive assistance programme with the International Atomic Energy Agency that will not only enhance our national
20/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
capacity to monitor and evaluate serious issues of nuclear contamination but that will also address health strategies and other key SDG benchmarks.
The Marshall Islands faces some of the more complex development, security and planning challenges in the world, but we lack the full tools available to tackle them. A nation struggling to attain basic social development goals will not be equipped to resolve any other challenge.
Progress in education is key. Firm efforts are under way to correct our course and to provide better opportunities for our youngest and future generations. We have found new pathways for building on our traditional knowledge and culture to enable our education system to draw on our own Pacific story and strength. But our efforts and good intentions alone cannot ensure that every willing student has an opportunity to succeed. We need international support.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands has one of the world’s highest rates of diabetes, which has led my Government to declare a state of emergency. Non-communicable diseases remain a primary threat to our national well-being. Without transformative partnerships, and without extending more closely to our shores the renewed United Nations 2008-2013 Action Plan for the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases, we risk a tragic downward spiral.
The term developing nation implies forward movement, yet for far too long the Marshall Islands has been only treading water. We have promising opportunities and aspirations for improving our investment platforms, but our untapped yet substantial resource base is often coloured by larger international influence.
Our fisheries represent not only a vital sector for our own development, but also a wider contribution to international food security, because the Pacific is steward of half the world’s commercial tuna. Our foreign fishing nation partners, who not by accident are also the drivers of global influence, have held the purse to our own future for far too long. Key stocks in the Pacific are being plundered at unsustainable rates that jeopardize our future.
Already, higher returns from foreign licenses have benefited our own national fiscal future, yet that is only a fraction of the true potential. It is unacceptable that,
on the one hand, we are expected to achieve the SDGs and to demonstrate dramatic development progress while, on the other hand, we are blocked from further gains from our own resources by the self-interests of distant fishing nations.
The Marshall Islands and the States parties to the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries of Common Interest remain firmly committed to the benefits of the Vessel Day Scheme and targeted high seas closures as a condition for fishing our waters. The tables have turned and, if others wish to fish our waters, they must now do so on our own sovereign terms.
As a low-lying island nation with no higher ground, climate change poses a severe threat to our security. Some have said that there is no more hope and no more time. I forcefully disagree. The future of my nation — the future of our very land — may rest more in the hands of my fellow world leaders than in my own. There is still hope — hope that my nation will be able to tackle the most difficult planning challenges and to build resilience wherever we can, and hope that the world will not turn a blind eye. I can assure the United Nations that the Marshall Islands refuses the very notion that we would willingly relocate wholesale to another country, or resign ourselves to saying that if the water comes, it comes.
As we move to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) later this year, in Paris, I am proud that climate change is now recognized by all world leaders as a reality that deserves, and is receiving, a firm and collective response. Everyone must act. Many, including my own nation, have already committed to emissions cuts well into the future of 2025, 2030 and beyond. But the world’s initial efforts are falling significantly short. Instead of indifference or fumbled excuses, we must achieve true leadership that provides a direct response to closing the global emissions gap.
As the broader United Nations debates Security Council reform to adjust it the modern world, the nations that portray themselves as deserving leaders have an excellent opportunity to demonstrate their leadership by not ducking the bill or pointing fingers, but by embracing the challenge of the global emissions gap. They should begin to speak about opportunities for new forms of energy, instead of dancing around perceived threats to growth. For the island nations, a
15-29568 21/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
world without a true commitment to decarbonization and meaningful strategies for its attainment is ultimately no world at all.
As dramatically different as our landscape is today, the tensions of an earlier age continue to resonate, from the time when the Pacific islands region served as the horrific theatre for a global power struggle. Decades later, we again face the complex push-and-pull of larger international politics. Our regional baseline is often one of severe fragility. We have sharp exposure to external shocks, and some of our emerging and future security challenges not only extend beyond our capacity but push the envelope of international precedent.
The treatment of our security as small-island and large ocean nations cannot be considered apart from that of much larger interaction across the Pacific. Some may view political alliances, borders and, in some cases, significant marine mineral resources as mere possessions ready to be plucked by the highest bidder or the strongest military force, just as one might pick ripe fruit from a tree. That contradicts the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.
I offer my firm support for the initiative proposed by New Zealand during its Security Council presidency, when it convened a Council meeting on small island developing States and threats to international peace and security (see S/PV.7499). That meeting revealed issues that slip under the global radar but that cannot be ignored. I urge the Council’s establishment of a regular agenda item on security issues in small island developing States.
I am proud to announce the formal establishment, earlier this week, of diplomatic relations between the Republic of the Marshall Islands and Cuba.
Everyone should participate on the international stage. The Republic of the Marshall Islands supports Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the specialized agencies of the United Nations, including the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the UNFCCC. It is imperative that the global community fully recognize and evaluate Taiwan’s important commitment to reduce its emissions. Furthermore, I call for Taiwan’s involvement in the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda, and urge recognition of the important assistance it has provided to my country in the areas of health, education and energy. The Marshall Islands welcomes Taiwan’s efforts as a regional peacemaker, including in cross-
strait issues, and urges that States Members of the United Nations recognize and encourage such progress.
Like many other countries, the Republic of the Marshall Islands believes that awareness of the catastrophic impacts and humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons must underpin all efforts towards nuclear disarmament. As a former United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands has a unique legacy shared only by a few other nations. Even while the United Nations was supposed to be furthering our development, 67 nuclear tests were conducted in our nation between 1946 and 1958 by our former administering Power, the United States of America, under our United Nations trusteeship status, including through authorization under two United Nations resolutions. That was the only time the United Nations ever explicitly authorized the use of nuclear weapons, and the results were, and remain, beyond tragic.
If our own past and its contemporary impact continue to bear that heavy burden, the whole world should know our story. I would therefore strongly urge Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to include the powerful and specific example of the Marshall Islands and the related role of the United Nations in his statements aimed at encouraging progress on nuclear disarmament and test bans.
It is essential for the survival of humankind that nuclear weapons never be used again under any circumstances. The universal way to accomplish that is through the total elimination of such weapons. I am deeply disappointed that political distractions resulted in the lack of an outcome from the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons earlier this year. It should be our goal as the United Nations not only to stop the spread of nuclear weapons but also to pursue peace and security in a world without them.
This year, I look forward to a truly united United Nations with the courage not only to address the immediate emergencies at hand but also to move us forward into our dynamic century.

70,2015,ETH,"I would like to begin by congratulating you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at this important juncture in the history of the United Nations. This has indeed been a seminal year. Not only is it one in which we are commemorating the seventieth anniversary of our only universal Organization, it has also been a year when bold actions have been taken for the sake of our people and planet.
I would also like to express my profound appreciation to your predecessor, our brother from Africa, who successfully steered the work of this body for the past year, a period that witnessed some difficult intergovernmental negotiation processes. His contribution to facilitating those processes and advancing the agenda of the United Nations was indeed significant, and we owe him a debt of gratitude for his tireless efforts. I would also like to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General for his dedication and tireless efforts to realize the aims and purposes of the United Nations.
What we have achieved so far this year through difficult negotiations and compromise, by adopting a compact for global partnership within the framework of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in July, as well as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) at the historic Summit we have just concluded, has made it evident that we are indeed potentially at a watershed moment in the history of the United Nations. We are confident that the same collective resolve will be demonstrated by Member States as we take up the challenge of an equally transformative change in United Nations peace operations.
The political will and commitment that we have demonstrated in adopting the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the 2030 Agenda give us hope and optimism that we can secure a new globally binding climate agreement in Paris in December under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In that regard, Mr. President, I would like to assure you of my delegation’s full support in helping you to discharge your heavy responsibilities during this momentous and historic year.
Ethiopia is indeed proud to be one of the founding Members of the United Nations. Although in our hour of need we could not count much on the support of the League of Nations, of which we were also a member, Ethiopia has nonetheless never lost confidence in multilateralism and has remained a staunch supporter of the principle of collective security enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. It is on the basis of that conviction that Ethiopia has been an active contributor to advancing the principles and purposes of the United Nations, including by deploying its forces as part of the Blue Helmets since the Organization’s early days. It gives us great satisfaction to note that Ethiopia is now the second-largest contributor of troops to United Nations peacekeeping, and I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to playing an active role in helping to ensure that the United Nations becomes more effective and secures greater legitimacy.
As we mark the seventieth anniversary of our Organization, it is only fitting that we take stock of the achievements and challenges of the past seven decades and draw appropriate lessons from history as we move forward. That the world has made tremendous progress in a wide range of areas by advancing the noble objectives enshrined in the Charter is not in doubt. The Organization has done commendable work to foster international cooperation for development, promote respect for human rights and address humanitarian problems. Nonetheless, what has been achieved so far is a far cry from the Herculean challenges we face today. Nor can we overlook our many failures as an Organization, something that, as has been so ably established by the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations, is very apparent in the area of peace and security, as well as with regard to the creation of a level playing field in international economic and trade relations.
Despite all this, however, one thing is self-evident. The United Nations is an Organization that none of us can afford to live without. In spite of its shortcomings, it remains the only universal Organization we have, whether we are big or small, rich or poor, providing us with a unique platform for advancing our common objectives and addressing the myriad problems we collectively face. The challenge that we have to address at this juncture in the history of the Organization is more or less obvious. It has to do with how we can make it relevant and effective as we collectively strive to meet the needs and aspirations of our people in
the twenty-first century. That, I believe, is the main essence of the anniversary celebration aptly captured in the slogan “Strong UN. Better World”. But the United Nations is, after all, an intergovernmental Organization whose strengths and weaknesses cannot be understood independently of the role of its members. It is therefore up to us to empower the Organization to fulfil its promises in a new era.
The United Nations is indeed a creation of the post-1945 world order and the devastating experiences of the Second World War and the Great Depression that preceded it, and that unquestionably inspired the letter and spirit of the Charter. The world has changed tremendously since then, however, and the complex and multifaceted challenges we face today — in particular, obviously, the threat of terrorism and violent extremism, the devastating consequences of climate change and other emerging challenges of our time — are quite different from those that the founders had to deal with in the immediate aftermath of the war. At the same time, not only has the membership of the United Nations changed dramatically over the years, but so have the geopolitical and economic realities of our planet. Today, with rapid globalization and a dramatic revolution in information technology, we are living in a much more interconnected and interdependent world. That is why the United Nations needs the tools necessary to deal with those challenges and realities so that it can better serve the needs of our peoples and nations in a new and completely different era.
The need for reform of the United Nations system has long been recognized, but forging the necessary compromise among the wider membership has not been easy. However, it can be delayed no longer. It is clear that if we do not undertake the necessary reforms, we will not be able to deliver the transformative agenda we have set for ourselves. That is the reason why it is not enough to adopt the next generation of Sustainable Development Goals, whose ambition and transformative aspirations make them truly historic.
It is also vital that the United Nations be made fit for the post-2015 era. A comprehensive reform of the United Nations system, particularly the Security Council, is indeed imperative if we are to reflect current geopolitical realities and make the United Nations more broadly representative, legitimate and effective. In that context, it is only proper that we seize this opportunity to once again echo Africa’s call to be fully represented in all the decision-making organs of the United Nations,
particularly the Security Council, as expressed in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.
We in Ethiopia remain fully committed to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. We are very grateful for the support and partnership of the United Nations in our development endeavours. The reason for the remarkable progress that we have made over the past 15 years, including achieving all of the Millennium Development Goals, is to be found in the fact that we have taken charge of our own destiny, devised our own development strategy and mobilized domestic resources for their implementation. But we have also made the best use of the development cooperation we have had with the United Nations and our other partners.
Ethiopia has embarked on an ambitious transformative agenda, with a view to achieving middle-income status by the year 2025. We intend to do so based on carbon-neutral growth through a climate-resilient “green economy” strategy that is fully integrated into our national development plan. The results achieved over the past five years are quite encouraging, and have
inspired us to do even more by implementing a second growth and transformation agenda that we will embark on soon. We therefore look at the possibilities that lie ahead with great optimism, the more so because we also trust that we are all determined to adhere to the commitment we entered into at the Summit concluded yesterday.
It is with that deep sense of optimism that I want to conclude by once again reiterating my country’s commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, as well as to continuing to play an active and constructive role in realizing its noble objectives."
70,2015,TCD,"Fifteen years ago, we welcomed unanimously the adoption of
the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and the Millennium Development Goals as the appropriate response to the poverty-related problems facing many of our countries. With the adoption of the post-2015 development Agenda (resolution 70/1), the General Assembly, at its seventieth session, has once again reaffirmed States’ determination to fight poverty by seeking new ways and means of promoting development. The success of the implementation of the Agenda will require suitable joint responses to the numerous challenges facing the world.
For many African countries, success in this endeavour will hinge on their security situation and their ability to finance their development plans and strategies. On a daily basis they face challenges that include terrorism and a drop in export prices. The successful implementation of this new development Agenda will also depend on the solidarity of developed countries towards developing countries in terms of effective financing. That is why we have high expectations that the conclusions of the third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa, will be translated into reality.
The theme of this session, “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”, means that we should place at the very heart of our general debate the issue of resolving the challenges that our Organization currently faces, the most intractable of which include armed conflicts, terrorism and migration. There is no doubt that Africa is one of the epicentres in that respect, given the multiple tragedies taking place there.
In the Central African Republic, for example, the particularly bloody clashes of recent days are jeopardizing the few hard-won victories achieved during the transition. The international community must not throw in the towel and must help the country emerge from this phase by providing it with the necessary budgetary support to hold elections within the set time frame.
In the Lake Chad basin, the terrorist activities being carried out virtually on a daily basis by the terrorist group Boko Haram against the countries of the subregion have not ceased despite considerable losses it suffered during the military operations carried out by a coalition of those countries’ armies. A multinational joint task force has been set up by the countries members of the Lake Chad Basin Commission in order to put an end to the abuses committed by that nefarious group.
15-29658 53/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
We remain confident that, with the intensification of this military cooperation, we will be able to once and for all eradicate this evil terrorist group. We also expect the United Nations and all of our partners to provide material, financial and logistical support to that force.
Aside from military action, these countries have decided to adopt an emergency development programme to help the most vulnerable populations fight against the deep-seated causes of insecurity, which are linked to poverty. This initiative, which originated in the Lake Chad Basin Commission, is a game-changer in terms of the peace and security efforts in the region and merits our support.
In Mali, the peace agreements signed recently in Algiers, which are aimed at transforming that country back into the haven of peace and tolerance that it had always been, are being put seriously to the test by armed groups, despite the presence of international forces. Chad calls on all parties to show wisdom and to respect their commitments in implementing the aforementioned agreements.
In Libya, the presence of a number of elements linked to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant continues to contribute to the collapse of that country and is an additional source of concern and even destabilization for Africa as a whole and in particular for neighbouring countries, including Chad. We urgently call for an end to the violence and for the establishment of a Government of national unity.
In South Sudan, Chad is working actively alongside a number of African countries to end the fratricidal war taking place there. Political actors must make every effort to concentrate solely on building their young State. The Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the ad hoc committee tasked with supporting it in mediation must continue to stand firm and act cohesively so as to achieve a lasting solution to this terrifying crisis.
In the Sudan, we support the holding of the national dialogue planned for next month, and we call upon the political class as a whole and all armed groups to take part in the process.
The majority of African crises are born of or fuelled by underdevelopment. That is why several initiatives have been launched, including the 2013 United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel, that have given rise to great hopes for the countries of the region, confronted as they are with the dual challenge of insecurity and
underdevelopment. It is regrettable, however, that the announcements made in the context of the Strategy are taking a long time to be translated into reality.
Turning to the rest of the world, the Israeli- Palestinian conflict remains unresolved, prolonging the suffering of the Palestinian people and intensifying rancour on all sides. It is high time to overcome the psychological obstacles by promoting the creation of a viable Palestinian State living in peace side by side with Israel. The raising yesterday of the Palestinian flag within the United Nations compound is, we hope, an important step towards finding a peaceful solution to this conflict, which is as old as our Organization.
In addition to this endless conflict, we are witnessing particularly violent crises in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. The international community must make every effort to help these countries overcome these tragedies, whose repercussions are being felt not only in the Middle East but also in the rest of the world. International peace and security are under serious threat from what is now happening in that part of the world. Religious radicalism and terrorism have found extremely fertile ground for their expansion.
The crisis situations that we have just described have greatly contributed to the upsurge in terrorism and the formation of criminal groups of all stripes. Terrorism, which spares no continent and no community, is fast becoming a global scourge. The acts of extreme violence committed against peaceful populations under religious or doctrinaire pretexts run counter to the principles of international law and human rights as well as religious principles.
In Africa, States grappling with terrorism are being forced to spend the lion’s share of their resources on security instead of on economic and social development. My country, Chad, is in this situation. We recently fell prey to that scourge with the death of around 100 persons assassinated in terrorist attacks in the capital and on the islands of Lake Chad. Chad is therefore paying for its involvement against terrorist groups in Mali and Nigeria, on whom it inflicted heavy losses, but Chad not will yield. It will continue to hunt down those terrorist groups relentlessly. All we ask from our partners is that they give us robust support, both technical and material, to enable us to provide the response needed in this faceless war.
The capacity of terrorists and extremist groups for transborder harm requires a collective and nimble
54/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
response. The way to fight terrorism together is to pool our resources and our response strategies through intensifying regional and international cooperation. In that connection, we propose that 2016 be declared the Year of Fighting Terrorism. It would be an opportunity to think seriously about the deep-seated causes of that phenomenon, the ways and means to contain it and to eliminate it in the long term.
The increase in the number and seriousness of crises has also created a phenomenon whose scale is unprecedented in the world: migration. Indeed, for some months now, the world has been witnessing an unexpected expansion of international migration. Those consequences are tragic for hundreds of thousands of women and children desperately seeking a better life. The international community will be able to put an end to this migration only if appropriate solutions are found to its origins and underlying causes, particularly in resolving conflicts and eradicating poverty in the countries of origin.
We also need to find solutions for the thousands of refugees and persons displaced throughout the world. They also need our help. Chad is the African country with the second-largest number of refugees, returnees and displaced persons on its territory, estimated at over 500,000. They come from the regions bordering Chad, particularly Sudanese Darfur, the Central African Republic, Nigeria and Libya. They live in difficult environmental and humanitarian conditions.
Once again, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all friendly countries and especially the Secretariat’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the International Organization for Migration for their support to those in need and for the advocacy they do for our country.
Our world has been facing an insidious threat for some time now — climate change. That will be dealt with at a major conference in Paris next month. Chad will actively be present at that conference because it is one of the major victims of degradation due to climate change. We are a Sahelian country threatened by drought and desertification, and we are powerless in the face of the progressive drying up of Lake Chad. We strongly hope that the negotiations will lead to an agreement and give us some hope that we can save our planet, including the imperilled Lake Chad.
The celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations also coincides with a very happy event, namely, the normalization of relations between the United States of America and Cuba, which Chad welcomes. We commend the courage shown by the leaders of those two countries to achieve that outcome. We urge them to continue their constructive dialogue until we see a complete and definitive lifting of the embargo that Cuba has unjustly suffered for decades, which will enable that country to recover the place it merits in the concert of nations.
Before concluding my remarks, the delegation of Chad would like to congratulate the President on his election and thank his predecessor for his remarkable work. We also pay tribute to the Secretary-General of our Organization for his personal and steady investment in the search for peace and security in the world.
I hope that this general debate will be crowned with success and, above all, that we will become much more aware of our individual and collective responsibilities. We also hope that it guides humanity to peace, security, stability and prosperity.
"
70,2015,AFG,"It gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, to express my sincere congratulations on the President’s well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I also express my deep gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his hands-on leadership of the Organization at a very demanding time.
The state of the world today, 70 years after the founding of this unique Organization, is at best a mixed one. While the newly drafted Charter of the United Nations asserted its primary principles as the maintenance of international peace and security after the Second World War, today a set of threats, mostly created by humans, challenges societies throughout the world and pose a threat to security, basic rights, dignity, our ecosystem, health care, State viability, governance, national and community cohesiveness and even cultural and religious identity. However, it
15-29425 31/34

A/70/PV.15 28/09/2015
also poses a serious challenge to the United Nations existing mandate, structure, resources and traditional approaches to dealing with global issues.
The Organization has tried its best to keep up with and adapt to an evolving environment, but if we look at the past seven decades, we see that our predecessors did their best to deal with a litany of conflicts, arms races, social and economic upheavals, ideological contests and geostrategic rivalries. But never has the world or the United Nations faced such fast-paced change, both constructive and harmful. Such abrupt fluctuations heighten expectations and immediate demands for solutions and answers. Those monumental tasks — coupled with population growth, unprecedented mobility, connectivity and access to information and technological know-how — necessitate constant negotiations, legal frameworks and new management and leadership skills. They also encompass inherent risks and security concerns.
At the same time, as the world shrinks and the human village grows, we are faced with the ugly aspects of globalization and inter-dependence. We are seeing the emergence of societies of haves and have-nots, subgroups, disenfranchised communities, abject poverty, upscale corruption, injustice, repression, sectarianism, terrorism and criminality, among others. At some point, it is the United Nations and other specialized and multilateral organizations that will need to be ready to drive the agenda and provide the required platform for decision-making. We urge future reforms to take the needs of our times into account and to offer flexibility and fast-track problem management for the work at hand.
Allow me to dwell on the case of my own country as a prime example of a nation in transition, as well as of a country exposed to multiple risks and threats at the forefront of our fight against international terrorism and extremism. Afghanistan is suffering, and its people demand solutions that are practical, verifiable and durable. The presence of terrorist sanctuaries and support networks in Pakistan continues to cause trouble inside Afghanistan. The Haqqani Network has been identified as a main culprit. It needs to be dismantled, as has been our demand in the past.
Our demands are legitimate, as our people continue to suffer at the hands of terrorist elements who cross into Afghanistan and indiscriminately victimize our citizens. That matter needs to be addressed on a bilateral basis and facilitated by trusted international partners.
As a case in point, over the past 48 hours, hundreds of militants, some of whom are foreign fighters, organized attacks in Kunduz province, where heavy fighting is raging. The day before, more than 10 spectators at a sports stadium were killed and many more were injured in Paktika when a bomb was detonated.
Those attempts will fail to subdue us, just as they failed to do so on other occasions over the past few years. In the broader context, Afghanistan continues to be the victim of terrorist organizations and violent extremists, including Daesh-type cells that are trying to find a foothold. Another fact is clear to Afghans across the board, namely, were it not for an external support system, access to arms and munitions, rest areas and hospitals and funding and training, as part of strategic collusion with powerful elements in our neighbourhood, this guerrilla-style low-intensity warfare would have been history by now.
We call on Pakistan to do what its leadership promised to us a few months ago when they agreed to crack down on known terror outfits, meaning the enemies of Afghanistan. We agreed to a paradigm change in our relations and engagement towards peace talks with the Taliban. Events turned out differently after it was divulged that the Taliban leader had been dead for over two years and the episode was a sham. A loss of trust can have irreparable consequences for all sides. We need to learn from that.
We have reached the one-year mark for the anniversary of the national unity Government. I am delighted to report to the General Assembly that Afghanistan has achieved significant milestones in the past year. Thanks to the exemplary generosity of our friends, the progress made in Afghanistan over the past 14 years cannot be discounted. We succeeded in prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable, improving living standards, providing access to education to boys and girls and improving health-care quality. Life expectancy has increased by an average of 20 years since 2001, with Afghans living well beyond the mere 40 years of age that was once the norm. Improvement in the health of women and children is particularly notable, as illustrated by the 54 per cent increase in the number of infants delivered and the 62 per cent decrease in infant mortality.
Thanks to the Government’s focus on gender equality, equity and equal opportunity, female political participation has also been strengthened. During the 2014 election, 35 per cent of voters were females.
32/34 15-29425

28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15
Women now claim 11 per cent of judgeships, with an additional 20 per cent in training.
Moreover, we are also strengthening laws and regulations that deal with torture, and we are taking necessary measures to prevent and prosecute individuals involved in any form of torture, as per the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.
We sincerely thank the international community for the exemplary support it has provided and for the generosity and patience it has so tirelessly bestowed upon us as a war-torn nation. I would very especially like to mention the United States of America, NATO, the European Union and the entire donor community for the blood of their soldiers, the sacrifices of their civilian workers and their expertise and encouragement.
As mentioned earlier, the recently escalating security issues have slowed down State-building and overall progress. But, through their patriotism and resilience, our national security forces have demonstrated their readiness to face the challenges posed by the Taliban and their terrorist and violent extremist groups. Furthermore, President Ghani and I prioritized a comprehensive reform agenda to root out corruption from our society and institutions and to promote transparency and efficacy at all levels of Government, the judiciary and at the national and subnational levels. An important component of our reform agenda concerns necessary changes in the work of our electoral institutions to strengthen the credibility and integrity of our future elections. In that respect, the reform commission recently presented a comprehensive set of recommendations, and we plan appropriate steps to implement them. We are confident that those efforts will go a long way in the consolidation of participatory democracy in our country.
In addition to security challenges, the menace of the illicit drug trade in Afghanistan is having an adverse impact on the economy and society. However, we have a new comprehensive action plan to combat the drug economy more effectively. We appreciate the contributions made by donors, especially the assistance provided by the United States. We are determined to meet the 10-year-long goal of defeating narcotics once and for all.
Regional cooperation on the drug problem is another key pillar of our strategy. Beyond cooperation on counter-narcotics, the unity Government is committed to enhancing regional engagement and
building constructive relationships based on win-win formulas, and turning Afghanistan into a connectivity hub for energy, trade, transit, transport, pipelines and fibre optics. The sixth Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan, held in Kabul recently, agreed to work on ways to develop and consolidate partnerships towards promoting regional economic cooperation and integration in Afghanistan and across the region. Success stories are already taking shape, such as the Central Asia South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project and the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline, turning Afghanistan into a land bridge connecting China and India through South Asia and Central Asia to the Middle East and Europe.
My Government has a strong political will to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) with the support of the international community, while we implement the remainder of the Millennium Development Goals and targets.
I would like to add Afghanistan’s voice in support of a reformed Security Council that is more inclusive, representative and transparent. Like most Member States, we agree that the Security Council is in dire need of comprehensive reforms to better confront twenty-first century challenges.
My Government supports the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. We reiterate our long-standing position that a two-State solution offers the best guarantee for long-term and sustainable solutions to the conflict.
In addition, I would like to express my strongest condemnation of the terrible acts against humanity committed by all sides in Syria, especially the Islamic State in Iraq and Shams. The people of Syria and Iraq are suffering. As a war-ravaged country, we feel their pain, dispossession and trauma. I call upon the global community to take prompt and urgent action and to facilitate a political solution through talks.
We look to the United Nations to remain beside us for years to come on our journey into the transformation decade. As we move forward, we expect a strategic realignment in the support role of the international community and the United Nations. In that regard, we welcome the outcome of the work of the tripartite review commission to determine the guiding principles of the United Nations future engagement in Afghanistan.
15-29425 33/34

A/70/PV.15 28/09/2015
In conclusion, let me reiterate my Government’s steadfast commitment to promoting the very principles on which the United Nations was founded. We are confident that, with the continued support of the family of nations represented in this noble Organization, we will realize our shared goal of a peaceful, stable and prosperous nation that is a catalyst for security and prosperity in our region and beyond.
"
70,2015,VCT,"In the Christian Bible, the Book of Proverbs suggests that mortal men live for threescore and ten years, a number that fairly accurately reflects the current modal life expectancy of the global population. Today we have assembled for the seventieth time in the life of the United Nations with the legitimate question of whether this imperfect assembly of mortals has seen its best days, or if, by reason of the strength of our principles
and actions, we may endure to overcome tomorrow’s challenges.
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines looks forward to the wise and experienced stewardship of President Mogens Lykketoft during this seventieth session of the General Assembly. President Lykketoft, who will celebrate his seventieth birthday during his tenure, can confidently stand on the exceptional works performed by His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa during last year’s session.
This year, possibly more than at any point in our modern history, our Assembly is beset by global threats and risks that force us to consider the ways in which our core principles of sovereignty and non-interference can overcome today’s challenges. Borderless menaces such as terrorism, economic crises, contagious diseases and climate change heed neither geopolitical boundaries nor governmental jurisdiction. Furthermore, the calamitous fallout of military adventurism, economic recklessness or environmental negligence is not confined to discrete national boundaries. Rather, the chickens often return to roost in far-flung, unexpected and often blameless locales. As such, more than ever our international relations must be defined by cooperation, collaboration and decisive action.
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small, mountainous archipelago of 32 islands scattered across a shimmering Caribbean sea. But the idyll implicit in our verdant peaks and crystal waters is now belied by the grave and gathering threat of climate change. Rising and raging seas attack our coastline and infrastructure from beyond our shores, while rains and climate volatility make landslides and deadly flooding a real and increasingly frequent internal threat to lives and livelihoods.
The intensifying vulnerability of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and its neighbouring islands to climate change is clear in the alternating bouts of drought and flooding that have caused hundreds of millions of dollars in loss and damage in my country in successive years. Less than two years ago, devastating floods washed away 17 per cent of our fragile gross domestic product and claimed 12 lives. Our quest to recover and to make our people whole again is a continuing struggle and one that takes place against a backdrop of hope that we are not soon beset by a similar tragedy.
One month ago, tropical storm Erika struck our sister island of Dominica, a mere 150 miles north of our
8/23 15-29595

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18
country. The death and destruction wrought by the storm are heartrending and serve as yet another unwanted reminder of the ominous threat of global warming and the precarious nature of our developmental aspirations in the face of an increasingly inhospitable climate. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and other Caribbean countries have joined friendly nations in assisting the Commonwealth of Dominica in its hour of need. I beseech other countries that have not yet supported this noble effort of relief, recovery and reconstruction to do so with the utmost urgency and generosity.
Our existential struggles in the face of climate change inform our posture in the frustratingly meandering negotiations to arrive at a legally binding agreement within the parameters of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We are two months away from a deadline for reaching such an agreement at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP21) in Paris, but the precariousness of our global plight is not matched by the ambition of our partners. Indeed, the posturing and recalcitrance of some major emitters suggest that COP21 may be yet another empty diplomatic dance that prioritizes process over progress.
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is embracing a green future. We are actively engaged in transitioning from fossil fuels to a renewable mix of solar, hydro and geothermal energy. Within the next three years, more than 80 per cent of our electricity needs will be provided by renewable energy. If we could control our climate destiny and insulate ourselves from the recklessness of other emitters, we would approach the future with greater confidence.
The aftershocks and repercussions of the global economic and financial crisis continue to convulse developing nations. The crisis casts a shadow on our collective efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and shrouds our newly adopted Sustainable Development Goals in uncertainty. The measure of our recovery is not the health of corporations or the rate of jobless economic growth, but the ways in which we have reformed our financial architecture and the reordering of priorities that places people and the alleviation of poverty at the centre of our developmental discourse.
The late United States President John F. Kennedy once said that if a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich. The fortress of wealth is not impregnable to the growing
unrest and instability born of crushing poverty. Our failure to address and assault global poverty in this era of excess and innovation stands as the most stinging rebuke to our existing system of crass commercialism and unfettered corporate profiteering.
In an Assembly shaped by the desire to end global wars, we must remember Gandhi’s admonition that poverty is the worst form of violence. We cannot simply pay lip service to people’s right to development. Instead, that right must emerge as the driving force in this Assembly’s senior years. The roots of modern poverty and underdevelopment are deep and diverse. But even the most casual student of history will acknowledge the debilitating and continuing impacts of native genocide and the institution of slavery on Caribbean States. They constitute in the aggregate an awesome legacy of underdevelopment, a historic bundle of wrongs to be righted.
I reiterate the united call of the Caribbean Community for reparatory justice from the major participants in and beneficiaries of the transatlantic slave trade. Our quest for justice is supported by the 33 members of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and numerous progressive nations globally. The fate of our indigenous peoples and the legacies of slavery and colonial exploitation are neither partisan political talking points nor historical afterthoughts. They are an ever-present modern reality whose redress remains a noise in our blood and an echo in our bones. These issues must form part of the post- 2015 development conversation, and also a part of our combined efforts to uplift the International Decade for People of African Descent.
It pains me that I must yet again speak, and demand appropriate redress, on the subject of the retroactive stripping of citizenship of persons of Haitian descent born in the Dominican Republic and their forcible deportation to Haiti, a country to which many of these victims have only a vague ancestral connection. We in the Caribbean Community are pledged to work with our Caribbean family in the Dominican Republic to assist in ending this tragedy at the heart of our Caribbean civilization, but the authorities of the Dominican Republic must demonstrate a good faith not merely in words but in deeds. We in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines cannot remain silent or indifferent in the face of this gross violation of human rights. This not a migration issue of the type that is currently engulfing the European Union. At its core, this is an international
15-29595 9/23

A/70/PV.18 29/09/2015
human rights issue of the gravest kind upon which the United Nations must pronounce unambiguously.
Seventy years ago, the United Nations was founded with a central goal of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war — the very first principle enunciated in our Charter. Today, wars and rumours of wars continue to bring untold sorrow to mankind. Too often these wars are the product of great Power arrogance and decisions based not on fact but on wishful ideological impulses. The results of these actions and inactions almost invariably exacerbate underlying conflicts and produce unwanted global repercussions.
International terrorism threatens us all and requires concerted international cooperation. Anti-terrorist intervention must not be shaped by which side of a border the terrorist armies happen to encamp or one’s ideological affinity for the Governments most threatened by these barbaric hordes. We have already learned that modern terrorism, wherever it takes root, can threaten peace and prosperity in any corner of the globe. Stamping it out must be a shared and pressing priority.
Diplomacy ought to be most active in averting conflict and defusing disagreements. Within the zone of peace that encompasses Latin America and the Caribbean, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is concerned at the sharpening of rhetoric between our long-time friends and allies in Guyana and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Their border dispute, which dates back to the nineteenth century, has long been constrained by the ties of brotherhood, solidarity and international cooperation. Accordingly, we call for renewed and reinvigorated diplomatic engagement in the management and ultimate resolution of this vexing issue.
The maintenance and restoration of international peace and security have been the responsibility of the Security Council for the last 70 years. The Security Council, more than any other body delineated in our Charter, is unmistakably in a period of doddering dotage, unable to act with the nimbleness or decisiveness necessary to meet modern challenges. The necessity of reform and rebirth, which is acute in any institution entering its eighth decade, is particularly pressing in the case of the Security Council. For too long, reform efforts have fallen victim to the geopolitical ambitions of entrenched Council members and the regional rivalries of legitimate aspirants. This must end. We must ensure that.
Similarly, the important and indispensable work of United Nations peacekeepers throughout the world must be above reproach. The United Nations must claim responsibility not only for its successes but also for its occasional grave failures. Our collective sanctimony rings hollow when the United Nations shirks its undeniable responsibility for spreading cholera in Haiti, to the tune of 9,400 deaths and more than 400,000 hospitalized. Legal loopholes cannot mask moral responsibility in this case. Nor can we condemn sexual violence as a war crime while shrugging off the unacceptable actions of some United Nations peacekeepers in the Central African Republic. Our Assembly has a responsibility to be open and transparent to meet these sporadic failings head on and to offer redress to all victims of peacekeeper negligence or aggression.
On Wednesday, tomorrow, I will stand a few metres away from where I am speaking today to witness the raising of the flag of the State of Palestine alongside other States’ flags in the United Nations compound. The decision to fly the Palestinian flag here at the United Nations, adopted by an overwhelming majority of Member States, is an unmistakable endorsement of a true two-State solution with a viable and safe Palestine living alongside its neighbours in a secure Israel. But the symbolic nature of next week’s ceremony is no substitute for continued action to make that two-State solution a reality. With each passing day, realities on the ground make such a solution increasingly difficult. Though the conflict between the States of Israel and Palestine are undeniably complex, they are not beyond the capacity of the parties and the international community to resolve, and we must do so. And we must help in doing so.
The Assembly’s unambiguous position on Palestine is reminiscent of our long-standing and overwhelming opposition to the United States commercial and economic embargo against the people of the Republic of Cuba. The embargo has persisted for 55 of the 70 years that the United Nations has been in existence, and its toll is measured in billions of dollars, hundreds of lives and countless developmental opportunities lost.
This year, Presidents Obama and Castro have demonstrated laudable courage in working together to move past years of enmity and mutual mistrust. But the welcome détente between the two countries has not yet led to a lifting of the embargo. There is much more to be done to unshackle the Cuban people from
10/23 15-29595

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18
the chains of an unjust, illegal and plainly outmoded blockade. Our collective pressure, so critical to the belated rapprochement, cannot waver. Instead, we must intensify our calls for the complete lifting of this anachronism, and to make whole this rupture in our hemispheric family.
This seventieth year of the United Nations must therefore be a year of not only action but also inclusion, outreach and redress of calcified injustices. As such, we must move beyond our inexplicable exclusion of Taiwan from the work of the specialized agencies of the United Nations. The perspective, experience and example of Taiwan as an active and responsible global citizen are self-evident arguments in support of their greater inclusion and participation. Taiwan’s continued exclusion can be neither explained nor justified by any rational and forward-looking global gathering.
In this, our seventieth year, let us pledge ourselves to liberate our nations and our global family from the continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation and warfare; to emancipate ourselves from the mental slavery of discrimination and learned helplessness; to unshackle our policies from the narrow nationalism and imperialist ambition that constrains the limitless possibilities of the human spirit. As nations and peoples we have choices. In the 70 years of this Assembly’s life we have sometimes chosen unilateralism. Many have chosen militarism. Many have chosen, too, to defer and dissemble.
Today, as we look towards a complex and uncertain future, let us instead choose love — love of our fellow human beings, love of our planet, and an abiding love not of problems but of their practical solutions. For with love, faith, works and hope all things are possible, including a further 70 years for the better of this remarkably important global gathering. We are all labouring in this vineyard. We must have the labour of love, of love, of love.
"
70,2015,UKR,"On behalf of Ukraine, I sincerely congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his
election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session, and wish him every success in his activities at this crucial historic moment. Our future will largely depend on the outcomes of this session and our collective decisions — whether we choose to follow the path of peace, security and human rights, or to plunge into the turmoil of new hybrid wars, chaos and suffering.
On the occasion of this seventieth anniversary, I am proud to speak on behalf of one of the founding members of the United Nations, a State that, back in 1945, took an active part in the San Francisco Conference, helped to establish the Organization and lay down the foundation for its activities, a State whose contribution back then was of importance in shaping the core of the United Nations: the Purposes and Principles of its Charter.
Regrettably, I am also speaking on behalf of a State Member of the United Nations that is now the victim of a brutal violation of the fundamental norms and principles of that Charter. The statement by Ukraine upon its joining the United Nations as one of its founding Members, which was delivered at the San Francisco Conference, emphasized that Ukraine had repeatedly been the subject of bloody invasions by aggressors that for centuries had sought to capture its territory.
A long time has passed since that landmark event. But, today, I have to recall that my country has become the object of external aggression. This time, the aggressor is the Russian Federation, a neighbouring country and a former strategic partner, which legally pledged to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and inviolability of the borders of Ukraine. That country used to be a guarantor of Ukraine’s security under the Budapest Memorandum, whereby security guarantees were provided to my country in exchange for the voluntary renunciation of the world’s third nuclear arsenal. Moreover, it is a permanent member of the Security Council, which is entrusted by the Charter of the United Nations with the maintenance of international peace and security.
In February 2014, Russia conducted an open and unprovoked aggression against my country, occupying and annexing the Crimea, wantonly and brutally violating international law and shocking the whole world community. I am deeply grateful to the delegations of the majority of the States Members of our Organization for supporting resolution 68/262, entitled “Territorial integrity of Ukraine”, which condemned the illegal
Russian annexation of the Crimea. It is regrettable that this clear verdict of the international community failed to persuade Russia to return to the civilized sphere of international law. Moreover, Moscow started a new reckless military game — this time, in Ukraine’s Donbas region.
Despite the fact that Russia is still refusing to officially acknowledge its direct military invasion, there can be no doubt that an aggressive war is being waged against my country. To mislead the world community, the Russian leadership orders its military servicemen to remove their insignias and the identification marks on military equipment. It orders the abandonment of its soldiers captured on the battlefield and the cynical use of mobile crematoriums to eliminate traces of its crimes on Ukrainian soil.
I would like to stress that neither a civil war nor an internal conflict is taking place. Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian territory in the Crimea and the Donbas region covers approximately 44,000 square kilometres, and millions of Ukrainians are under that occupation. The goal of the current war is to force the Ukrainian people to give up their sovereign choice to build a free, democratic, prosperous and European State. All that is taking place against a backdrop of traitorous rhetoric about brotherly peoples, sharing a common history, related languages and a predestined common future. In actual fact, we are dealing here with a desire to return to imperial times, with spheres of influence, and a desperate attempt to obtain self-affirmation at another’s expense.
For over 20 months, the aggression against my country has been fuelled by Russia’s financing of terrorists and mercenaries and its supplying of arms and military equipment to illegal armed groups in Donbas. Over the past few days, we have heard a conciliatory statement from the Russian side, including a call for the establishment of an anti-terrorist coalition and a warning that fraternizing with terrorists would pour oil on the flames. That was an impressive but hard-to- believe story.
How can a country call for an anti-terrorist coalition when it is inspiring terrorism so close to home? How can it talk about peace and legitimacy, if its policy is to wage war through puppet governments? How can it speak of national autonomy, if it punishes a neighbour for making a choice? How can it demand respect for all, if it respects no one? The Gospel of St. John teaches
26/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
us that in the beginning there was the word; but what kind of Gospel is one following if all one’s words are so duplicitous?
Let us return to the situation in Donbas, where, I have to say, we are being forced to fight fully armed troops belonging to regular units of the Russian armed forces. Heavy weaponry and military equipment are concentrated in the occupied territories in quantities such as the armies of the majority of Member States can only dream about. In particular, various pieces of state-of-the-art military equipment that were manufactured in Russia are to be found among that same weaponry and, contrary to the public assertion of the Russian President, are unlikely to be available for sale in a regular wholesale army store, unless, of course, it was located in the Russian Federation and provided free shipping.
During the period in question, over 8,000 Ukrainians, of whom 6,000 were civilians, died at the hands of the Russian-backed terrorists and occupiers in Ukraine and Donbas. More than 1.5 million residents of Donbas were forced to flee their homes and, moving to safer regions within Ukraine, became internally displaced persons. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the international community for making such a considerable effort to provide assistance to those in need.
At the same time, I call on the United Nations and other international actors to continue to pay special attention to that very important issue. I would like to draw everyone’s attention to the fact that this is not the first time that the same permanent member of the Security Council is undermining peace and security at both the regional and the international level.
Over the past 24 years, ever since the questionable transfer of permanent membership on the Security Council from the former Soviet Union to the Russian Federation, the conflict in Ukraine is but one of several hybrid wars that Russia has unleashed. In fact, in order to preserve its influence in neighbouring countries, Russia, for decades, has deliberately created, and surrounded itself with, a belt of instability, made up of Nagorno Karabakh, Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea and Donbas — all regions involving protracted conflicts and supported by or directly related to Russia. But the Kremlin has gone even further. Today, the Russian men in green are treading on Syrian land. What and who are next?
In every democratic country, if one party steals another party’s property, an independent court restores justice by enforcing the rights of the aggrieved party and punishing the offender. Yet, here we are in the twenty- first century and our Organization is still without an effective instrument to bring an aggressor country to justice, a country which has stolen the territory of another sovereign State. Seventy years ago, the authors of the Charter of the United Nations envisaged that sanctions imposed by the Security Council would be one of the punishments applied in response to breaches of peace and acts of aggression.
However, they would have been hard put to imagine a situation in which that punishment needs to be applied against an aggressor State that is a permanent member of the Security Council. Since the beginning of the aggression, Russia has used its right of veto twice during the Council’s consideration of questions related to Ukraine. At the outset, Russia blocked a draft resolution (S/2014/189) that condemned the fake referendum on Crimea’s annexation in March 2014. At that very moment, in my capacity as a Ukrainian member of Parliament, I was there when the Russians said that there was a vote on this same fake referendum. No member of Parliament was present. On the contrary, there were only Russian soldiers surrounding the Parliament of Crimea.
The second time that Russia used its right of veto was to block a draft resolution (S/2015/562) that would have established an international tribunal to investigate and bring to justice all those responsible for the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. By its disgraceful use of the veto on that draft resolution, Russia clearly demonstrated to the whole world its defiance and its unwillingness to establish the truth — not just the truth about the perpetrators of that terrorist attack and the arms that were used to shot down that plane, but, more important, the truth concerning those who organized that crime and the country from which those arms had been transported. I think that everyone in this Hall clearly understands the real motives of Russia’s use of the veto on a draft resolution concerning a tribunal to investigate Flight MH-17. Moreover, a draft resolution on the establishment of an international peacekeeping operation, whose purpose would have been to stabilize the situation in Ukraine and stop the bloodshed, was also blocked because of the potential threat of Russia’s use of the veto.
15-29431 27/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
Abuse of the right of veto — its use as a licence to kill — is absolutely unacceptable (see S/PV.7384). The Organization should make its collective voice heard clearly on this subject. For its part, Ukraine stands for the gradual limitation of the right of veto, with its eventual abolition. The right of veto should not exercised randomly or to grant a pardon or clemency in cases where crimes have been committed and merit appropriate punishment.
In that context, I welcome the proposal of my French colleague and friend, President Hollande, supported by President Peña Nieto of Mexico, aimed at regulating the use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities. Primary attention should be given to the modernization of the Security Council, including the enlargement of its membership and the improvement of its working methods. The membership of the Security Council should reflect the realities of the twenty-first century and include a higher number of African, Asian and Latin American States. An additional non-permanent seat on the Council should be given to the Eastern European Group, as its membership has doubled over the past two decades.
Ukraine also considers improvement of the peacekeeping and peacebuilding architecture of the Organization an important element of United Nations reform. I am proud of Ukraine’s international reputation as an active and devoted contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations. Despite external challenges, we remain a reliable partner of the Organization in that noble matter. Ukraine’s contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security provides us with the moral ground to count on the same assistance from the Organization in times of the vital importance of that issue on the part of my country.
The special peacekeeping mission in Donbas, under United Nations auspices, could become a very useful instrument contributing to the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Ukraine is committed to following the letter and spirit of the Minsk package. We demand the same approach from other signatories that have lately resorted to the language of blackmail. Otherwise, there is no alternative to sanctions, including their strengthening; and there is no alternative to a peaceful resolution of the crisis.
Full access to all occupied territories by the monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), withdrawal of Russian
military forces, military equipment and mercenaries from Ukrainian territory and restoration of full control by Ukraine over its border with Russia— these must all be ensured. Freedom, peace and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity — Ukraine does not demand more; however, it will not settle for less.
Unfortunately, today Ukraine is, though not by its own free will, one of the areas involved in the fight against the terrorist threat. We strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The activities of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Al-Qaida, Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab and others comprise a global challenge. The only possible way to address that evil is to unite in a common, uncompromising fight against it.
International terrorism has proved to be more flexible than the political will of nations and today has taken on new hybrid forms. State and non-State actors have become interlinked. The struggle for one’s rights has been replaced by ruthless terror. We are convinced that the need for a universal international instrument able to counteract that crime is not only urgent but long overdue. For that reason, the conclusion of the preparatory work on the draft United Nations convention on the prevention and combating of terrorism should become a top priority of the General Assembly at this session.
A special role in the fight against international terrorism should be given to the most reputable legal institutions: the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. Ensuring that those institutions have universal jurisdiction is a core element in overcoming the impunity of the terrorists themselves and their patrons — those regimes whose national policy has become the mass production of terror.
I strongly believe that one of the most important aspects of fighting terrorism lies in honouring and sharing the memories of the victims. In that context, I propose that, at the current session, the General Assembly consider designating an international day to commemorate the memory of the victims of terrorist acts. It is my feeling that humiliation, disregard of people’s will and violation of their fundamental rights prompted Ukrainians to leave their homes in order to protest in 2013, which led to the beginning of our revolution to uphold our dignity.
Ukraine has paid and continues to pay an extremely high price for its freedom and the right to live in a free country — the price of human lives. That is why the
28/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
interests of every single individual and the protection of people’s rights are at the core of my large-scale reform programme, which was launched one year ago. For the first time in its 24 years of independence, Ukraine has adopted a national human rights strategy. It took into account the best international practices from the human rights perspective, including the European Union’s Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy.
Russian aggression exposed the problem of ensuring human rights in the Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Leading international human rights organizations warned about the radical deterioration of the human rights situation, which applies directly to Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars in the occupied Crimea. I am referring specifically to the practice of imposing Russian citizenship in occupied Crimea by the Crimean occupation authorities, as well as the systematic persecution, arrest, abduction and killing of pro-Ukraine residents of the peninsula and the complete elimination of the independent media. Ukraine reaffirms its commitment to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. By all legal means, we will continue to defend the rights of the Crimean Tatars — the indigenous people of Ukraine — and the Ukrainians, who are suffering from the repressive policies of the occupation authorities in the Crimea. I believe that the problem of blatant violation of human rights in Crimea deserves particular consideration in the General Assembly. And I hope that the decision to address this issue will be taken during the current session.
I also feel obliged to mention the names of Nadiya Savchenko, Oleg Sentsov, Alexandr Kolchenko, among many other Ukrainians, who are political prisoners of the Kremlin or have been illegally detained and sentenced. For example, Oleg Sentsov, a respected filmmaker, was sentenced to 23 years in prison solely for being a Ukrainian patriot. I call upon the United Nations and its Member States to launch a worldwide campaign to put pressure on the Russian authorities to immediately release all the Ukrainian citizens that they are holding hostage. We will be able to achieve our goal only if our action is global. Most of all, Ukraine needs solidarity and assistance, which are truly powerful instruments against aggression and injustice. Ukraine will win for sure because truth is on our side. But we will do so much faster if we have the support and solidarity of the whole international community.
The ongoing hybrid war of Russia against Ukraine has demonstrated that the international community is facing another challenge, which requires the consolidation of our efforts. The full- scale information war and propaganda campaign have become a particularly corrosive form of non-military aggression. Fake news, blatant lies spread to justify aggression, propaganda of intolerance and violence are phenomena of the same order, which undermine the principle of freedom of expression and poison human souls and minds. That is why the task of strengthening the role of information in the maintenance of peace and security is more important than ever. I call on the General Assembly to strongly condemn these shameful phenomena and to discuss the ways to confront them.
Despite the external challenges that I have referred to, Ukraine is fully committed to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. We are ready to share joint responsibility for solving specific vital problems and priorities of the most vulnerable groups of countries, such as the small island developing States. As one of the Friends on Climate Change, Ukraine is looking forward to reaching consensus on a universal agreement in the area of climate change as soon as possible. We hope that this result will be achieved by Member States in December in Paris. We have to understand that the price of this issue is the safety of future generations and the sustainable development of humankind.
We shall not be able to achieve the sustainable Development Goals unless we are able to prevent environmental and technological disasters from happening. As a result of the Russian aggression, Ukraine faces another challenge — the protection of its environment in Donbas. The irresponsible and criminal flooding of mines by terrorists has led to the poisoning of drinking water, the soil, and the flora and fauna in the region. The atmosphere is polluted owing to explosions and the shelling of sensitive industrial infrastructure. In fact, we can even speak about the risk of environmental disaster. I am convinced that the issue of environmental protection during conflict needs the special attention of the relevant United Nations body.
With regard to technological disasters, it is my duty to recall one of the most horrific of them. Next year will mark the thirtieth anniversary of the tragedy of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. I would like to request that the President hold a special meeting of the General Assembly dedicated to that anniversary in April 2016.
15-29431 29/51

My country’s address on the occasion of joining the United Nations included the words,
“Ukraine, with its best human strength and material resources, will be able to make a significant contribution to maintaining peace and global security”.
Now, 70 years on, I reiterate Ukraine’s unwavering commitment to exerting a further maximum effort to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, a commitment enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Our focus will be on the achievement of that noble goal if we are elected to a non-permanent membership of the Security Council during 2016-2017. In the capacity of member of the Council, Ukraine intends to remain a reliable and consistent partner, guided not by its own, but by the global agenda, and will resolutely follow the spirit and letter of the Charter. And I am firmly convinced that the Organization will pass the extremely complex test with dignity and strengthen its role as a guarantor of order, peace and prosperity in the world. Let God be with us!
"
70,2015,SLB,"The Government and people of Solomon Islands join me in conveying our warm greetings to the General Assembly. I extend to you, Mr. President, our felicitations on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventieth session and assure you of Solomon Islands’ support and cooperation during your term in office.
As we commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, I wish to pay tribute to the 51 founding leaders who created the Organization in 1945. The United Nations represented peace, security and cooperation then, and continues to do so now. On this auspicious occasion, Solomon Islands reaffirms its faith in and commitment to the Organization and its Charter. Having said that, much has happened since 1945, and the world has changed over time.
Solomon Islands is part of the historic journey of the United Nations. When we first joined the Organization in 1978, there were only 145 members. Today, membership has increased to 193. At present, more than two thirds of the Members of the United Nations are from the developing world and are all seeking a fair, equitable and rules-based multilateral system. That is a sentiment that is echoed in this Hall every year. As long as wealth continues to reside with 20 per cent of the world’s population, a global system manifesting such a divide will always face challenges in attempting to respond meaningfully to our collective agenda, even though it recognizes the fairness and equity that we all desire.
The number of conflicts that the United Nations deals with has also multiplied. We now have 16 peacekeeping missions. That has meant that, multilaterally, we are spending more on security than on development issues. We need to reverse that trend by striving to invest more in peace through strategies and programmes and less on military solutions and by addressing security and sustainable development. Where there are situations of potential conflict, we need to work with all Governments concerned through an inclusive mechanism that avoids unilateral decisions, which always result in protracted conflicts and strife and cause immense suffering to the people who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of peacebuilding efforts.
In that regard, the United Nations, on the occasion of its seventieth anniversary, must demonstrate its commitment to greater action. Our appreciation goes to the former President of the General Assembly, Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his strong leadership in guiding the historic development framework, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (resolution 70/1), which the Assembly adopted last week.
For developing countries, what is required is to translate the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
15-29664 21/25

A/70/PV.23 01/10/2015
of the new Agenda into action. That can happen only if the SDGs are matched with the necessary resources, in accordance with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, so that the international community can deliver the necessary means of implementation and convert the Goals into action. Humankind’s survival depends on the world coming together on our shared 2030 Agenda. It offers us a last hope of getting it right. Incremental action is not an option. Transformative change comes about only if we think big, smart and innovatively to achieve the 17 global SDGs and the 169 targets. It has to be driven by a new form of partnership, anchored in a new spirit of solidarity, fostered by new political relationships and a paradigm shift in international cooperation — one that guarantees prosperity for all.
Solomon Islands registers its appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the sterling leadership that he has provided the Organization with over the past nine years. We join the Secretary-General and the General Assembly in the call for a more open process in the selection of a new Secretary-General, who is due in office by January 2017. Over the past seven decades, the permanent five members of the Security Council have selected the previous Secretaries- General. We call for a more accountable, democratic and transparent process for such appointments. To that end, the Assembly, as the chief deliberative and most democratic and representative organ of our Organization, must play a central role in the selection process.
Solomon Islands reiterates its interest in serving in United Nations peacekeeping missions. We have a well-trained police force that is ready, willing and able to serve alongside other United Nations officers. Our Royal Solomon Islands Police Force has a programme in place to achieve that goal. We intend to see our first team of officers out in the field during the current session of the General Assembly.
Solomon Islands remains under-represented among the United Nations Secretariat staff. I am pleased to note that the United Nations is organizing competitive recruitment exams in our country this year. We are grateful for that outreach and look forward to filling our quota, while enriching the diversity of the Secretariat. On the United Nations country presence, Solomon Islands welcomed resolution 69/318, calling for an enhanced United Nations country presence in the Pacific region, particularly at the country level. We welcome new thinking with regard to establishing
subregional offices within the Pacific region, noting the distance and the diverse and peculiar characteristics of the region. In that regard, Solomon Islands offers to host one of the subregional centres.
The democratic coalition-for-change Government that I lead was formed following last year’s successful national general election using a biometric voter registration system for the first time. We are pleased with the system and will be building on its success, along with other electoral reforms. I thank all partners, including the United Nations, Australia and the European Union, for supporting our biometric registration system, and we seek partnerships to invest in the next phase of strengthening our democratic institution.
The review of our Political Parties Integrity Act is a priority that my Government is working on to further strengthen political stability in Solomon Islands. Likewise, my Government has launched an ambitious governance-reform programme that includes the enactment of anti-corruption and whistle-blowers legislation and the establishment of an anti-corruption commission. Similarly, my Government will introduce legislation to establish growth centres and industrial zones in the rural sector for the purpose of redistributing economic and social opportunities to the broader community.
At the regional level, Solomon Islands greatly appreciates its partnership with the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), which includes the participation of the 15 members of the Pacific Island Forum. That regional cooperation initiative has done much in terms of the restoration of the rule of law and the rehabilitation of mechanisms of Government, particularly those responsible for peacebuilding and ensuring the maintenance of law and justice. The RAMSI drawdown process will end by 30 June 2017. The assistance from our regional neighbours is greatly appreciated.
Solomon Islands assumed the chairmanship of the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) in June this year. The Group is made up of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and the Front de libération nationale kanak et socialiste of the Territory of New Caledonia and my own country, Solomon Islands. The MSG countries make up at least 95 per cent of the total population of the Pacific small islands developing States (SIDS). The Melanesian subregion is rich in biodiversity, and its peoples speak a quarter of the world’s languages.
22/25 15-29664

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.23
Solomon Islands is exploring the establishment of an indigenous biocultural platform to preserve our traditional knowledge and our rich biodiversity.
At the recent MSG Summit, leaders of the Group agreed to foster more comprehensive economic cooperation on trade, aviation, fisheries, shipping and finance among its members and beyond the subregion. The Group further agreed to establish a regional police academy. At the summit, the MSG leaders also conferred associate membership on Indonesia and observer status on the United Liberation Movement for West Papua.
Solomon Islands calls for the full and swift implementation of the 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonized Countries and Peoples. Of interest to the MSG is the question of New Caledonia. This year marks 162 years of the French colonization of New Caledonia. That territory is entering its seminal phase as it prepares for an act of self-determination in 2018. It is our fervent hope that the process will succeed with the full backing of the French Government. We wish them well in that historic undertaking.
Having said that, Solomon Islands cautiously welcomes the fragile consensus reached in addressing New Caledonia’s electoral issues by the Special Committee on the Noumea Accord. We therefore reaffirm the importance of ensuring that the electoral process is addressed amicably, given that it has implications for establishing a credible referendum process that conforms to and is consistent with accepted principles and practice of self-determination as outlined in United Nations resolutions, including resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV).
Solomon Islands welcomed resolution 69/103, which reaffirmed the inalienable right of the people of French Polynesia to self-determination. Solomon Islands calls on the administrative Power to fully cooperate with the work of the Special Committee. We note that 30 years of nuclear testing by the administrative Power caused widespread atomic radiation, which has resulted in considerable health and environmental concerns. It is a matter that is of concern to us, and we call for more attention to be paid to the issue by the Assembly.
Solomon Islands reaffirms that human rights principles are universal, indivisible, interrelated and must be treated in a fair manner. All States have a legal duty and moral responsibility to uphold, respect and promote human rights and, where necessary, to take
preventive, protective and punitive measures against human rights abuses or violations, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and applicable international laws.
Against that backdrop, the General Assembly is well aware of the continuing concerns regarding human rights violations in the Papua and West Papua regions of Indonesia. Solomon Islands, together with the Pacific Islands Forum, is seeking genuine dialogue and cooperation with Indonesia on that issue. The outreach is intended to resolve reported allegations of human rights violations in two of Indonesia’s ethnic Melanesian regions, namely Papua and West Papua. Solomon Islands further calls on the Geneva-based Human Rights Council to do more investigating and monitoring of the allegations of human rights abuses against ethnic Melanesians in the concerned regions of Indonesia. We would like the issue to be addressed in a timely manner.
In that connection, the Pacific Islands Forum, at its recent Leaders’ Summit held in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, approved the deployment of a fact-finding mission to West Papua to establish the alleged abuses of human rights there. We appeal to the Government of Indonesia to allow free and unrestricted access to the mission in the true spirit of regional cooperation. In the long term, however, the United Nations cannot shy away from the root causes of those violations.
On South-South cooperation, I thank the Papua New Guinea Government for opening their educational institutions to Solomon Islands students. We acknowledge Papua New Guinea’s bilateral assistance and substantial commercial investments in people-to- people relations. Our Melanesian relations remain firmly rooted in our cultural and traditional values, which link our people now and into the future. We are forging similar economic, sociocultural and trade relations with Fiji, Vanuatu and other Pacific countries.
Turning now to Solomon Islands’s relations with Cuba, we thank that fellow small island developing State for training more than 100 Solomon Islands medical students. To date, 44 doctors have graduated from medical schools in Cuba and are now back in the country. I thank Cuba for its solidarity and support to Solomon Islands.
Two months ago, Solomon Islands joined the international community in celebrating a new era of relations between Cuba and United States of America.

The restoration of relations, after 54 years, presents a new beginning for the United States to reconstruct its relations with Cuba, based on mutual respect for national sovereignty and the freedom of international trade and navigation. We welcome President Obama’s progressive easing of restrictions on Cuba. However, more needs to be done. We call for the total lifting of the economic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba, so as to normalize relations between the two States, which are a mere 90 miles apart.
The issue of climate change is for Solomon Islands, like other small island developing States and least developed countries (LDCs), an existential concern. It impacts everyone, but the poorest and marginalized populations often bear the greatest burden. It is imperative that the upcoming twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December, deliver an ambitious, comprehensive and robust climate-change agreement that is inclusive and leaves no one behind.
As ocean acidification increases, Solomon Islands tourism, fisheries and the livelihood of 85 per cent of our population have been put at risk. Sea-level rise has already led to land inundation, the loss of biodiversity, threats to food security and the resulting relocation of populations from low-lying islands to other parts of the country. Solomon Islands will be relocating its National Referral Hospital from its coastal location in Honiara, given the frequency and intensity of disasters threatening the entire infrastructure system.
In the past year, flash floods wiped out more than 9 per cent of Solomon Islands’s gross domestic product. In 2015, we were hit by two cyclones, Chan-Hom and Raquel. Solomon Islands welcomes the participation of new development partners, namely, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, for their humanitarian assistance to our people this year. We very much thank them. Coming from a disaster-prone region, we look forward to the World Humanitarian Summit, which is to be held in Istanbul next year. We hope the world will come together and create a new playing field to build a resilient and environmentally responsible community operating within safe limits for the planet.
Cognizant of the fact that success is founded on partnerships, the Solomon Islands Government is seeking deepened, expanded and results-oriented partnerships in the areas of economic infrastructure, hydroelectric and geothermal energy, agriculture,
forestry and fisheries so as to kick-start sustainable development for our rural population in accordance with the SDGs.
The leaders of the Pacific small island developing States at the Pacific Islands Development Forum Leaders’ Summit, held in September in Suva, Fiji, issued the Suva Declaration on Climate Change, calling for the coming Paris agreement to be legally binding, with a call for the global average temperature increase limit to be well below 1.5°C. The Declaration further calls for loss and damage to be anchored as a stand-alone chapter in the agreement, and for strong mitigation commitments in the agreement that must be espoused.
It is not far from reality to say that SIDS and LDCs, such as Solomon Islands, are the front-line States when it comes to bearing the brunt of the negative impacts of existential issues such as climate change. We are concerned that the slow progress in the climate negotiations will cause uncertainties and possibilities for a climate-change-induced situation that could trigger conflicts. That uncertainty prompts Solomon Islands to seek a seat in the Security Council for the period 2031-2032, which will be one year after we have completed and taken stock of the 2030 Agenda.
Solomon Islands supports reform of the Security Council and calls for a SIDS-dedicated seat in an expanded Security Council. That is needed in order to ensure that SIDS security issues are meaningfully addressed in the Council. The Council will need to adapt to the ever-changing realities that we face in our world. We are pleased with the progress achieved in the negotiations on reforming the Council thus far.
On the issue of gender, Solomon Islands’s three-year term on the UN-Women Executive Board comes to an end this year. We leave the Board with our Strategic Plan 2014-2017. Unfortunately, UN-Women’s work programme remains underresourced, and we therefore call on Member States to support that work. The 20-year-old Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action remains a source of guidance and inspiration on gender equality and gender empowerment. Solomon Islands remains committed to the full, effective and accelerated implementation of the Platform, which should enable the realization of the gender-related Goals and targets under the SDGs.
In 2009, Solomon Islands, as an archipelagic State, lodged four continental shelf claims with the United
24/25 15-29664

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.23
Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. One of those claims is a joint submission with the Federated States of Micronesia and Papua New Guinea on the Ontong Java Plateau. That submission is currently being examined by a United Nations subcommission of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. The next session between the States and the subcommission is scheduled for this month, and we hope that negotiations will bring about an amicable solution for all parties concerned.
Solomon Islands, as a close friend of the Republic of China/Taiwan, continues to call for the Republic of China on Taiwan’s meaningful participation in our United Nations specialized bodies. The Republic of China on Taiwan continues to take on international obligations with regard to climate change and aviation. The Republic of China on Taiwan, which is among the largest economies in the world, needs to be part of the global solution in the various international frameworks. The international community must welcome the interest of the Republic of China on Taiwan in participating fully as equals in the proceedings of the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The Solomon Islands has benefited from the Republic of China or Taiwan’s partnership with us on the Millennium Development Goals, and we will enhance our bilateral cooperation with the Republic of China on Taiwan under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). The Sustainable Development Goals are universal in nature, and we expect our friend and partner to join the world in helping to eradicate poverty and to heal the declining health of our planet.
In closing, I would like to state that the Solomon Islands supports multilateralism with continued integrity, courage and strength, which will give our people a message of hope, optimism and a positive future.
"
70,2015,GRD,"I am pleased to bring our usual warm greetings from the Government and the people of Grenada, on whose behalf I am privileged to address this renowned institution and distinguished gathering. I am also pleased to join esteemed colleagues who preceded me in thanking the outgoing President of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa of Uganda, for his energetic and focused leadership in the sixty-ninth session. I commend that session for blazing a trail that gives us no choice but to follow as we strive to deliver and implement a transformative post-2015 development agenda.
I also congratulate and thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his extraordinary leadership of the United Nations and express our deep gratitude especially for the keen interest he has shown in the developmental challenges facing small island developing States (SIDS).
To the President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, I wish to say: please be assured, Sir, of my delegation’s fullest cooperation and support as you embark on the road ahead for peace, security and human rights.
As is the custom, our themes reflect the current state of international affairs, as indeed they must. It should be no surprise that matters of peace, security and human rights continue to feature in the international discourse. Indeed, without those fundamental pillars of an orderly international system it would be colossal waste of time to even start to think of improving the quality of the lives of our people. Therefore, at this historic juncture of the United Nations at 70, the President is accepting a new commitment to action for transforming our world. Interestingly, recent history has shown us that without peace, security and human rights, development cannot be sustained.
The impacts of climate change are already being felt the world over, and without a successful, legally binding agreement in Paris, we will see climate change continue unabated. We will see more floods and droughts, more hurricanes and cyclones, more hunger, more insecurity, more troubled spots around the world and more economies in crisis. As leaders and as a
community of nations, we will take actions from today onwards that will dictate whether we bequeath to others a world where peace, security and human rights can be assured, or a world where human tragedy and suffering become the norm.
The General Assembly has recognized the unique vulnerabilities of SIDS. Grenada endorses the Security Council’s initiative to discuss the challenges facing SIDS. We strongly urge the Council to give greater consideration to the special circumstances of SIDS in relation to both traditional and non-traditional security concerns. Climate change is a critical issue, not only for intellectual debate, but in its manifestation as a major, multidimensional security threat to small island developing States. The foundation of our sustainable development platform is undermined by climate change. The recent experience of our sister nation, the Commonwealth of Dominica, is ample evidence.
Let us now commit, ahead of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, to adopting a new, legally binding global climate change agreement that will hold the global temperature rise well below 2°C, or 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. A framework for climate change cannot wait. We need immediate consensus on climate change, including financing.
We wish to place on record our gratitude to our international partners for their support in developing our capacity for climate change adaptation and mitigation in Grenada. We reaffirm our commitment to Agenda 21 and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) 2Pathway.
Grenada strongly supports convening the Triennial Oceans and Seas Global Conferences, for the duration of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), to coincide with World Oceans Day, beginning with the June 2017 Conference in Fiji. We further suggest that initiatives like the Small Island Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative be used as a global platform for Governments and relevant stakeholders to ensure financing for the full implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 and its targets.
A little over two years ago, the Government of Grenada, with the support of the international community, initiated a programme of fiscal adjustment and structural reforms to boost economic growth and
36/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
competitiveness, restore fiscal and debt sustainability and strengthen the financial sector. We have made significant progress thus far, and our achievements have been documented in published reports of the International Monetary Fund and others. The success of the programme derived from a social compact initiated by government to include our churches, non-governmental organizations, trade unions, the private sector and political parties.
We now call upon the international community to make good on its unkept promises of 0.7 per cent official development assistance, notwithstanding that 0.2 per cent goes to SIDS, such as Grenada. We urge the international community to share in the sacrifice that is required at this difficult period in our history. However, the unilateral graduation of many small island developing States to middle-income status is premature and has resulted in significant budgetary shortfalls. I therefore reiterate the call for a more holistic and comprehensive set of indicators for classifying States. The point is that per capita income as a sole measure, without the context of climate vulnerability and other inherent structural challenges, does more harm than good.
We must reaffirm that the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will depend on revitalized and enhanced global partnerships. Together, Governments, civil society, the private sector and the United Nations system must embrace all stakeholders, and we must get delivery on the commitments made on the Samoa Pathway. Our people and our planet can realize prosperity and peace only through reliable partnerships and frameworks, which are assured by trust.
Small island developing States like Grenada — already disadvantaged by small economies of scale, climate impact caused mainly by developed countries, and high indebtedness — only seek a level playing field that takes our disadvantages into account. However, we are disheartened by the fact that the same developed partners with whom we sit in our transparent intergovernmental engagement to find ways to develop our capacity revert to suspiciously blacklisting and declaring all jurisdictions to be harmful tax havens. We call for developed countries to carefully weigh their interactions with small and vulnerable island States to ensure that we are in no way unjustly victimized economically and in reputation, especially when we
have worked assiduously to comply with stipulated requirements.
Grenada asserts that partnerships for sustainable development must be based on global solidarity, which affirms that none among Member States is more equal than the others. Grenada seeks to safeguard the fiscal performance achieved with the necessary support of partners and stakeholders.
History dictates that we must embrace our grave responsibility, daunting though it may be, to ensure a peaceful and sustainably developed planet for posterity. The carnage being committed around the world as we speak, demonstrated by the persistent disregard for human life, and the quest for dominance concealed by any faith cannot be condoned. The concept or definition of peace begs for global consensus. A peaceful world is not just one without a world war. Authority and power must mean caring, not killing.
The plight of displaced people driven from their habitat — in extremely inhumane conditions, in search of peace and a better life, free of fear — is regrettable and warrants our collective and decisive action to avert a wider and more destructive wave of migration. The spectacle of drowning and dying people, lost and displaced children, the abuse of the weak and the elderly and sexual violence against women are disgraces to humankind. Their stories remind us of our interconnectedness as a global village and of our common humanity. In the words of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”
Grenada condemns the atrocities and crimes against humankind. Human dignity must be maintained in our world as one vital element to ensure the future we want. Our cities and human settlements must remain inclusive and safe, resilient and sustainable. Therefore, Grenada appeals to all Member States to embrace SDG 11 and to promote dialogue and diplomacy in the resolution of conflicts. In that regard, Grenada applauds the progress made in the recent rapprochement between Cuba and the United States. Grenada sees this peaceful resolution through dialogue as an example to be emulated between and among all States where violence, conflicts and disputes prevail. Nevertheless, Grenada joins in the call for the total lifting of the commercial and financial embargo imposed on the sister island of Cuba.

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
Grenada supports objective assessments of the role of the United Nations in the modern world so as to consolidate its established knowledge-based authority and legitimacy as the premier global political forum. However, it is time to update our GPS. Maintaining the status quo in the Security Council should not be an option. But the Security Council, as a pillar of global security, must be carefully handled. In this regard, our Organization should take stock of the contributions made by all Member States to the reform of the Security Council, bearing in mind that a strengthened Council will be better obtained and maintained through global consensus. Grenada also applauds the efforts to strengthen the role of the General Assembly to ensure lasting peace, security and human rights.
Ambitious though it may be, the agenda set for the post-2015 era dictates that we must succeed. If we have the courage to start, we have the capacity to successfully implement the SDGs for our planet, for prosperity today and for posterity.
"
70,2015,AND,"It is my honour to represent my country, the Principality of Andorra, before the Assembly, which this year is celebrating its seventieth anniversary.
Over the past seven decades, we have listened to speakers talking from this very this rostrum, year after year, of peace, social justice and, more recently, of sustainable development. If we have talked about those themes for so long, perhaps that is because something has not been going as planned. Perhaps the
international community has not done well and has been unable to make sufficient progress in promoting the values that are part of the philosophy and charisma of the United Nations. Clearly, with the United Nations, the international community has made unprecedented progress. However, to recognize that not all has gone smoothly and that there is much room for improvement is the first step towards meeting present and future challenges in a realistic and effective manner.
The world has changed a great deal in the past 70 years. Seven decades ago, the international community came to an agreement to prevent a third world war that would have devastated the future of humankind. To prevent that, the major Powers were able to choose consensus and harmony over unilaterally imposing their own order, because solutions that are concerted, balanced and fair are much more lasting than those imposed through coercion or the unilateral use of power.
As we heard President Obama say a few days ago before the Assembly (see A/70/PV.13), no country can claim to solve the world’s problems unilaterally, and no country can remain isolated and think that the problems affecting the rest of the world will not affect it. A country as small as Andorra understands, perhaps better than others, the deeper meaning of those words.
Over the past 70 years, Andorra has made the transition from isolation to openness. Seven decades ago, our country was only beginning to overcome its cloistered past. For centuries Andorra was a reclusive country, surrounded by its mountains — both isolated
and protected by its environment. The construction of roads that connected us with the neighbouring regions of France and Spain were the way we overcame our isolation. Thanks to that geographical opening, various sectors developed in Andorra, such as tourism, trade and finance. That provided opportunities to the local population, as well as to the thousands of people from neighbouring countries who sought new opportunities in our country and who have helped enrich the Principality of Andorra and make it greater.
Andorra’s history is the history of its ongoing adaptation to its environment. It is also the history of continuous change. In the 1980s and 1990s, my country aligned its institutional systems to others. That too was a change and an opening. In my generation, our mission has been to open up and harmonize our economic system. Three years ago, we proposed and approved an economic law that removed restrictions on foreign investment and conferred full economic rights to foreign nationals starting on their first day of residency. In parallel with that, Andorra has opted for cooperation and transparency. We have approved a new fiscal model that is in line with others. We have made and will continue to make progress in exchanging tax information, and we have begun to build a network for double taxation agreements.
The world is changing, and Andorra must change with the world. We have chosen to become a more open, more competitive and more transparent country, because we are convinced that increasing economic ties among countries is a way to establish the foundations of a more cooperative, more just and more peaceful world. That was in fact the spirit that guided the construction of the European Union over the past 60 years.
Andorra is currently negotiating an Association Agreement with the European Union that establishes a stable horizon for opportunities and prosperity for our citizens. We do so in the same spirit of cooperation, healthy competition and transparency that we have brought to our economic reforms in recent years. Andorra needs broader horizons than those fixed by our mountains, and that will also happen through the European Union. To opt for a more interrelated and open world, with stronger economic, cultural and social ties among nations, is also to opt for peace and harmony. As President Obama said yesterday, the great challenges of our time, including economic ones, must be addressed jointly, and that is what we our trying to do in Andorra.
Andorra believes that after its first 70 years, the United Nations also should promote a process of reform. That is why we have supported the political declaration on suspending the right to the veto in the Security Council in cases of mass atrocities, an initiative that has been and is being promoted by the French Republic and the United Mexican States. It is important that France, as a permanent member of the Security Council, is part of that initiative.
Here, I would like to commend France’s initiative, as expressed on Monday through President Hollande (see A/70/PV.13). France could retain the major Powers’ right to the veto, but it understands that that right should be moderated under certain circumstances, because institutions are here to serve the values, and not the reverse. And international institutions should be at the service of people and the universal values of peace, solidarity and justice.
In extreme situations, when the survival of thousands of people is at stake, the international community cannot remain deadlocked. The balances that gave birth to the United Nations cannot be used to excuse deadlock in situations that are extreme for humankind. The citizens of this great global city that is the world demand solutions, and institutions must always be part of the solution, not part of the problem. That is why we must address the matter of Security Council reform. We must move the United Nations forward, adapt it to the changing times and reform it to improve it, without making radical changes yet in a resolute, effective way. We need to do that now, without waiting for another humanitarian crisis or a new stalemate to reveal our shortcomings and weaknesses.
In extreme situations such as that in Syria during recent years, the international community must be able to provide effective and fair responses. And, let us say clearly, so far we have been unable to do that. That creates an image of frustration and impotence that we should avoid. When there is a massacre, there is no middle ground: one is either part of the problem or one is part of the solution. The international community must always be part of the solution. The consequence of our failure to respond in time to the crisis in Syria is obvious every day on Europe’s borders, where thousands of refugees arrive in flight from massacres. This is not a migration phenomenon motivated by socioeconomic factors. What we are seeing is an exodus of people fleeing war and fleeing death. They are not seeking a better life; they are seeking simply to live.
2/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
And that calls directly and bluntly to the very essence of the United Nations.
Andorra is committed and sensitive to the situation we are witnessing in Syria. That is why the Government that I have the honour to head has decided to join the effort to host refugees. Our country wants to be faithful to its tradition of hospitality and integration, and we want to be part of the solution — a balanced solution agreed in the European framework because, once again, global problems require global solutions. Andorra, from its modest position, will be part of that global solution. The desperate cry of refugees, wherever they may come from, calls us all. It is sad that the developed countries have taken longer to react than have those less favoured. As we heard on Monday from President Hollande, it is the least developed countries that have most quickly welcomed the refugees fleeing the war and the tyranny of the various conflicts that unfortunately affect many places on our planet.
Because we in the more developed countries have been slower to react, we must move decisively to enact reforms that guarantee that an atrocity such as that in Syria will not be repeated. Governments need to carry out forward-looking policies. In the international arena also, the best policy for promoting peace is clearly conflict prevention. Accordingly, Andorra commends the recent agreement between the United States and Iran on the nuclear issue, which shows that no matter how far apart positions may be, there is always room for cooperation and harmony.
The fact that we are a small country is not in any way incompatible with the fight against atrocities of war. In that connection, Andorra accepted the Kampala amendments, a text that defines the crime of aggression and establishes the conditions in which the International Criminal Court can exercise jurisdiction over such crimes so that they do not go unpunished.
Some years ago, in this very Hall, in speaking about the conflicts in Libya and Syria, we discussed whether effectiveness or justice was preferable in resolving conflicts. That is an open question, but I believe that the way in which events have unfolded demonstrates that it is an artificial debate. We must be both effective and just, because justice, if not effective, is just a pretty word. And effectiveness without justice winds up being ineffective. As His Holiness Pope Francis said from this rostrum last month (see A/70/PV.3), justice is a will that is effective, practical and constant, with concrete steps and immediate measures.
There are no lasting solutions without justice. In that regard, regimes and tyrants who continue to perpetrate massacres and repeatedly violate human rights cannot be part of the solution, because they are ultimately part of the problem. The victims of conflicts cannot live knowing that they have not been taken care of adequately by the international community.
From the time of its founding, the fundamental goal of the United Nations has been the promotion of peace and the prevention of conflicts. The founders soon realized, however, that peace and justice cannot be disassociated from education, opportunities, social rights and the rational and sustainable use of the environment. Andorra has accordingly committed itself to other fields such as education and sustainable development.
Our country has long experience in welcoming immigrants and in dealing with diversity. Proof of that can be seen in our educational system, which incorporates the French, Spanish and Andorran educational systems and has resulted in a trilingual society, prepared for a global world. On that account, our country has become meaningfully involved in the Global Education First initiative, promoted by the Secretary-General, which advocates universal primary education, quality teaching and the promotion of global citizenship. We must always bear in mind the values that are part of that initiative.
The need to tackle problems from a global perspective is more apparent than ever in environmental concerns. There are problems that we can attempt to solve unilaterally, and we might achieve an imperfect and short-term solution. Global warming is not one of those problems. Either there will be a global solution, or there will be no solution at all. That is why we cannot lose sight of the notion of global citizenship within a global village, which President Dilma Rousseff evoked in her opening statement in the Assembly (see A/70/PV.13). Small countries such as ours perhaps better understand the notion of a global village, for Andorra is both a country and a village. Who better than we can act on the slogan that says we must think globally and act locally?
As a small country, it is clear that Andorra needs its natural environment and the help of others to reverse the situation and resolve issues. In Andorra, the effects of global warming concern and affect us in a very specific way. The average temperature in the Pyrenees is rising at a rate of 0.2°C per decade, and precipitation
15-29816 3/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
has been annually decreasing by 2 litres per square metre. Experts’ calculations predict that by 2050, our water reserves will be reduced by 18 per cent. Those statistics are of particular concern to a country that lives on the tourism of snow and of mountains.
The major climate change agreements must be integrated into the national policies of every country. For some time Andorra has been working in that direction, and in recent years we have seen the improvement of all environmental indicators. But we also know that the reach of national policies is reduced, especially in a country like ours. We need global solutions that can be applied locally. For that reason, Andorra was one of the first countries to make its national contribution to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Paris in December. Andorra has committed to reducing its emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 37 per cent by 2030. That metric places us within the global commitment to ensure that the increase in global average temperature remains below 2°C.
We endorse the statement made by President Hollande in urging countries that have not yet submitted their contribution to the Conference of the Parties to do so by December. At the Conference, we must provide the international community with the necessary tools to be able to confront the tremendous environmental challenges of the future and come away with a new paradigm for the energy and environmental policies of every country. At times, within the international community it seems as though there is little sensitivity to national problems and that national policies lack a global vision. As our fellow leader and President of the French Republic said, if in Paris we put off finding solutions, later will be too late. The citizens of the nations we represent are calling on us. We cannot allow failure to reach an effective and definitive agreement in Paris.
Seventy years ago, the world was coming out of a half-century marked by two world wars. It was a world of delicate balances. This is not the time for balances, but rather for firm commitments. It is time to forge more policies among nations and leave behind disunity in decision-making. For seven decades, the United Nations has been the guarantor of peace, human rights, justice and sustainable development. When it is time to take a determined decision, each country and each ruler knows that the international community and the world
are watching. As representatives of the international community, we must also be aware that the world is watching us and that our decisions will be judged by future generations. To those future generations we must leave a more just, prosperous, peaceful and sustainable world.
For 70 years, heads of State, prime ministers and ministers have stood and spoken at this rostrum. They have done so to talk about peace and promoting human rights and justice. There will come a day when we will no longer need to defend those values so vehemently, because we will have made them into a reality.
"
70,2015,SVK,"During the past 70 years we, the States Members of the United Nations, have been driven by the noble ideals and aspirations that the visionary founders of the United Nations laid down in its Charter in 1945. At the same time, we have been regularly confronted with the grim realities of international affairs. Over its history, the United Nations, both as an intergovernmental Organization and as an actor on the world stage, has been tested by numerous conflicts, humanitarian crises and immense
34/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
political and economic changes in the world, as well as by a lack of financial stability.
Throughout all those years, the United Nations has played a crucial role in preventing global conflicts and has carried out vital work around the world in its service to humankind. From the outset, the United Nations has made major contributions to furthering the development and codification of international law as a way of regulating international relations. We should take a step back to see how far we have come and how far we need to go in meeting the challenges that exist across the three pillars of the Organization’s work: peace and security, development and human rights. New and acute challenges to the multilateral system and new threats to peace and security that transcend national borders have, unfortunately, emerged. Each and everyone is concerned by the threats of pandemics, climate change, migration, cybersecurity, and the multifaceted and violent nature of terrorism, including organized crime. There are no exceptions.
The United Nations is the right place where all those threats should be addressed and eventually solved. I am deeply convinced that the United Nations remains strategically positioned to provide leadership and effective multilateral responses. A strong and effective United Nations means a better world, a more caring and accepting world, where nations and peoples of different religions, cultures and history can live together in peace — a world where right is might, not might makes right. I believe that strengthening the United Nations is the best investment for achieving the universal desire for peace, development, equality and justice in the world.
We should collectively seek practical means that will enable the current system to live up to its original purposes. That will enable the United Nations to meet the weighty demands that are being and will be made upon it today, tomorrow and in many years to come. The Member States are the owners of the United Nations. Every country — big or small, from North or South, landlocked or insular — has an important individual responsibility and role to play as a driver of the necessary change. My Government has always had strong confidence in the United Nations and remains ready to fully shoulder its responsibility and commitments in that regard.
The scale of global development challenges is unprecedented. A couple of days ago, in this very place we adopted the historic document defining the
Sustainable Development Goals, “Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (resolution 70/1). We may call it a programme for a better planet, but it is not about the numbers, but about changing our mindsets. It is setting up the new philosophy of existence in a sustainable future. Its cornerstone is full inclusivity and zero disparity.
The global security environment has never been as dynamic and uncertain as today. The number of major civil wars has almost tripled. The number of conflict casualties has skyrocketed. The most worrisome fact is the increased number of civilian casualties, including women and children. The United Nations works to maintain international peace and security in a world where security threats are becoming more complex and asymmetric, and conflicts more intractable and less conducive to traditional political settlements. The current pattern of violence also has serious implications for the implementation of mandates to protect civilians in the field. The United Nations has increasingly come under attack in areas where it has been present. Naturally, in such conditions, the level and the main priorities for United Nations involvement are being re-evaluated in a process of strategic reflection.
A secondary effect is the dramatic increase in the number of refugees. The World Bank estimates that roughly one fifth of the world’s population is affected by some form of violence or insecurity. The total number of people forcibly displaced by war, conflict and persecution rose to roughly 60 million by the end of 2014. On a daily basis, we are confronted with gruesome images in the news or directly in our streets, squares and transportation hubs. Forced displacement has, sadly, become a deliberate and widespread tactic, meaning that displacement is not only a short- term humanitarian problem, but also a long-term development and State-building issue.
The current migration crisis is one of the most complex challenges, one that we have to face up front and address together. It affects all of us — the countries of origin, transit and destination. It therefore requires joint responses. Both immediate and long- term measures are absolutely necessary to address those challenges, which include illegal migration, the smuggling of and trafficking in human beings, and gross human rights violations.
We must offer our assistance to those in need and prevent further tragedies involving refugees. For that to happen, we need systematic and comprehensive action
15-29658 35/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
and close cooperation on the part of countries, both of origin and of destination, that will bring a long-term sustainable solution. We must address the root causes of migration, namely, conflicts, intolerance, violence, poverty and a lack of the conditions needed for a decent life, just to mention a few.
As acknowledged many times before, the irreplaceable nature of the Organization is most marked in peacekeeping. The past two decades have significantly tested the concept and conduct of United Nations peacekeeping operations. Slovakia has been an active contributor and stands ready to continue its cooperation with the United Nations in that field.
I was particularly pleased to see that both review panels — the High-level Independent Panel on United Nations Peace Operations and that of the Advisory Group of Experts on the 2015 Review of the Peacebuilding Architecture — have put strong emphasis on enhanced conflict prevention, diplomatic engagement and mediation support in the work of the United Nations system. Speaking from my personal experience as a mediator in South-Eastern Europe, I cannot but support the importance and high relevance of preventive diplomacy across the conflict spectrum and as a part of broader, nationally owned strategies to promote sustainable peace and development. The culture of conflict prevention and the conflict-resolution approaches that are now taking root in the United Nations system must be further developed, alongside more effective peacekeeping and peacebuilding.
It has been 15 years since the adoption of the landmark Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security. Yet the impacts of conflicts on women and children are still inordinate, and their engagement in peace processes is still insufficient. Gender equality is a natural precondition for sustainable development, stability and peace. As former Secretary-General Kofi Annan said,
“When women thrive, all of society benefits, and succeeding generations are given a better start in life.”
The presence of women negotiators in high-profile United Nations peace and mediation processes, the role of women deployed by the United Nations to major conflict zones and high-stake inter-State negotiations, as well as in peacekeeping and peacebuilding in general, is irreplaceable and should continue to grow.
International terrorism in its most violent forms is an increasingly alarming threat to global peace and security, and those forms have become more diverse and fragmented in recent years. Slovakia strongly condemns all terrorist acts as criminal and unjustifiable. No terrorist act should be left without an adequate response from the international community. No perpetrator should be left unpunished and no movement affiliated with any form of terrorism should be tolerated.
The United Nations has done much to set standards in the fight against international terrorism and to encourage and help Member States to meet them. The tenth anniversary of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in 2016 will provide us with an opportunity to make our efforts in this struggle more efficient. It should be carried out in a multilateral and coordinated manner, with full respect for human rights and the rule of law. We should also redouble our efforts to conclude a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Last but not least, Member States must strengthen their prevention efforts by working directly with affected communities to counter the violent extremism and radicalization that lead to terrorism. If we want to tackle this threat, we need to confront extremism in all its forms, violent and non-violent. Hate has never been the way to achieve a better future for anyone.
We are now fewer than 60 days away from the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris, where the international community will discuss a new international climate change agreement. The impact of climate change is visible and undeniable throughout the world. Extreme droughts, melting of polar ice, substantive changes in long-term climate patterns and the rise in sea levels are the most glaring examples. As a result, Slovakia is committed to adopting at the United Nations climate conference this December a global binding climate agreement that will accelerate the shift towards societies and economies that are low-carbon and climate-resilient worldwide.

There are various internal and external forces that could drive any organization to change. Terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, poverty, disease, disparities causing socioeconomic tensions resulting in migration — all these challenges pose vital threats to humankind, and the only difference is how quickly the catastrophe strikes. The logical questions therefore relate to how ready we are to effectively react to challenges of the twenty-first century and whether we can draw useful lessons from the response to Ebola as an international health security threat.
Continuous management reform, optimal use of modern technologies, and gradual improvement of methods and structures for work that takes into account changes in the world are crucial if an organization wants to stay relevant. This is especially true for the United Nations. The seventieth anniversary of the Organization is viewed by many as a timely moment for achieving tangible progress. We need to address all existential challenges with the same attention. Act as one. Struggle as one. Deliver as one. One planet, one humankind, one destiny.
Let our work here at the United Nations be as real, practical and focused as possible so that we can deliver good results in the spirit of cooperation and compromise. The key desired result should be a strengthened and more effective, streamlined and responsive United Nations — a truly global organization that is better able to address interconnected and multidimensional threats and challenges to international peace, security and development.
I would like to conclude by quoting Norman Cousins, an American political journalist and professor, who received the United Nations Peace Medal in 1971:
“If the United Nations is to survive, those who represent it must bolster it; those who advocate it must submit to it; and those who believe in it must fight for it.”
The current General Assembly session will be a new test of our commitment and ability to join forces in the pursuit of common goals. I am confident that under the leadership of President Lykketoft, we will be able to achieve the desired outcome.
"
70,2015,GIN,"Seventy years ago, the United Nations was born with the aim of creating a world of peace, security and economic and social progress. Transformed by those noble ideals, we have together extinguished many hotbeds of tension, sown the seeds of trust among peoples, restored hope to the people and paved the way for prosperity for all nations. Beyond those undeniable achievements, the state of the world motivates us to consider the way forward to assure our people of true tranquillity that will enable them to thrive in harmony in a safer and more equitable environment.
Indeed, peace, security and human rights remain the foundation of our prosperity. We must, therefore, recognize that the prosperity we wish to share is seriously threatened by new barriers to stability and universal progress. Violence is resurfacing, driven by extremism and intolerance. Development for all remains a struggle owing to entrenched extreme poverty and its corollaries. Exclusion, a source of frustration, threatens democracy and good governance. There are so many aspects that feed the tragic migration flows — a true bleeding of the productive forces of the South that requires an urgent, comprehensive and lasting response.
Our commitment to peacekeeping materialized first in the Middle East, but that region is today once again being subjected to shocks that inflict the worst sort of suffering on its peoples by denying them their fundamental rights to freedom, dignity and well-being.
Palestine is still occupied. Its people should enjoy all their rights within the limits of a State with secure and internationally recognized borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We urge the international community to do everything possible for the resumption of negotiations between Israel and the State of Palestine, which are fated to live side by side. That is the way to ensure security in that part of the world, which is plunged into the throes of a many-sided crisis with tragic humanitarian consequences.
Africa, which is gradually emerging from its stagnation to enjoy renewed growth, is investing in mechanisms for capacity-building in the defence and security sectors in the framework of responsible autonomy for the stability of its States. It goes without saying that our efforts will seek to eliminate all the hotbeds of tension that stand in the way of democratic
8/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
progress at a time when we are witnessing a flare-up of terrorism whose ramifications from now on will leave no region untouched. We must find the ways and the means to check that scourge, which strikes our peoples at their very core, attacks our national symbols and leads to profound humanitarian crises.
It is clear that this wager can be won only with a participatory, concerted approach on the part of our peoples and countries to defining inclusive development policies and programmes as a bulwark against marginalization, which causes frustration and withdrawal. This wager also depends on our determination to eliminate economic inequalities and social disparities in order to maintain global stability. The challenge is therefore to dedicate democratic culture as a guarantor of human rights and fundamental freedoms as the foundations of more just and more equitable international relations.
We have just adopted the post-2015 development agenda, which integrates the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Achieving the 17 Goals of that ambitious programme will clearly demand the mobilization of resources sufficient to guarantee, inter alia, decent jobs for young people and to equip women with the skills necessary for their full potential and empowerment.
However, that will be possible only in a healthy, protected environment. That is why we hope that the upcoming twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris will lead to a binding agreement that ensures the survival of our planet. We urge all Member States and partners to contribute to the Green Climate Fund.
Prosperity cannot be built on instability. The international community has the obligation to assume the responsibility for making our planet a safe place where the creative genius of humankind can flourish. It is up to us, under the umbrella of global partnership, to strengthen our collective action to spread peace across the universe in order to crystallize the ideals that inspired the creation of our Organization. To do that, we must adapt our vision of the management of global affairs to the current reality.
It cannot be said often enough: the international system must be reformed. It must allow us all to fully participate in the world’s evolution. The time has come to make the United Nations the springboard for the
emergence and spread of a truly global society. The time has come to turn this prestigious place into a mold for shared solidarity. It is high time to turn this marvellous tool into a temple for the promotion of peace, equity and justice.
Guinea remains convinced of the need to strengthen the role of the General Assembly and to democratize the Security Council. That is why we welcome the initiative of France and Mexico to limit the use of the right of veto in cases of mass atrocities. Still, that measure aimed at preserving peace and respect for human rights must be universal, equitable and applicable to all regions of the world.
Détente, a key concept in international relations, is indispensable to the global equilibrium. The peaceful settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue and the long- awaited rapprochement between the United States of America and Cuba that should lead to the lifting of the embargo constitute important steps in establishing a climate of peace and security conducive to the promotion of mutually advantageous cooperation. History has demonstrated once again that by choosing the virtues of negotiation and dialogue over the use of force it is possible to work through the most serious differences.
Our firm belief in the efficiency of multilateralism remains unshakeable. It is the only option for addressing the ever more numerous and complex challenges that stand in the way of the progress our peoples so deeply yearn for. Our country will spare no effort to participate in that uplifting endeavour, above all at a moment when Guinea is joining the democratic dynamic by holding a transparent presidential election on 11 October. In that regard, I would like to commend the leading role of the United Nations and all our partners in the dialogue process that led to the signing on 20 August of the comprehensive agreement between the presidential movement and the opposition. For our country, this election will mark a new beginning towards genuine economic and social development.
The President returned to the Chair.
Moreover, Guinea welcomes the goodwill of the international community, which has consistently supported us in our efforts to realize the legitimate hopes of our people. The exceptional mobilization of the international community in the fight to eradicate the Ebola epidemic, along with its commitment to
15-29946 9/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
supporting our reconstruction programme, is part of that spirit of solidarity.
That is why, as we express our warmest congratulations to you, Mr. President, we already comprehend the immense task that awaits you, for which Guinea will provide unstinting support. You will surely benefit from the positive actions of your predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, whose dedication and accomplishment gave greater impetus to our collective commitment. Along with the activity of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has earned our congratulations and encouragement because of his invaluable contribution to strengthening multilateralism, your actions, Mr. President, will help to make the United Nations more responsive to the legitimate hopes of humankind.
"
70,2015,NER,"It is a real pleasure and an immense privilege to take the floor before the Assembly at this historic celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. First, I wish to address my warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your outstanding election to head the General Assembly at its seventieth regular session. Your vast experience of international and parliamentary issues, together with your eminent personal and professional skills, are a guarantee for the success of our work.
I should also like to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, for having presided brilliantly over the sixty-ninth session. To the Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon, I reiterate the gratitude of my delegation for the special interest he has always shown in seeking solutions to the many challenges that the United Nations and its Members have had to face.
This session in an historic one, as I said earlier, and the theme that you, Sir, have chosen for the general
14/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
debate this year — “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights” — is very timely because it is both an appeal to take stock and a look to the future of the United Nations work in the service of international peace and security, economic and social development and human rights. In that respect, we welcome the fact that the principles enunciated in the Charter of the United Nations have stood the test of time and that the United Nations has many successes to its credit.
In the area of international peace and security, our Organization has played an appreciable role in resolving conflicts and preventing others, in particular with the establishment of preventive diplomacy in 1997. The adoption in 2001 of the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects; the adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in 2006; the relaunching of the Conference on Disarmament with a view to recommendations on nuclear disarmament and practical confidence-building measures for conventional weapons; and most recently the conclusion of the Arms Trade Treaty all attest to the United Nations progress towards its goals.
With regard to the maintenance or re-establishment of international peace and security, peacekeeping operations are increasingly carried out with the participation of regional organizations and have evolved significantly in scope and mandate in order to adapt to crisis and conflicts that have become increasingly complex. Moreover, in the weeks to come the General Assembly will discuss in-depth the new report of the Secretary-General on the future of United Nations peacekeeping operations (see A//70/95). In this respect, I should like to emphasize that Niger is the world’s seventeenth-largest troop- and police-contributing country, with 1,826 men and women in United Nations peacekeeping operations in 2015.
With regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes, the International Court of Justice, established by the Charter of the United Nations as the principal judiciary organ of the United Nations, has contributed to maintaining international peace by handing down decisions and advisory opinions in resolution of a variety of many disputes. The Niger trusts the Court and has resorted to it in two border disputes with neighbouring States, which not only allowed those disputes to be permanently settled but also reaffirmed
good-neighbourliness and cooperation with these countries.
In the same vein, the conclusion in July of negotiations agreement between the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany, on the one hand, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, on the other, with regard to the nuclear programme of the latter, was in our opinion a real reason for satisfaction.
In the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which began several years after the creation of the United Nations, has not yet been resolved, despite its heavy toll in human lives, mainly civilians, and the many initiatives of the United Nations and the peace plans initiated by other members of the international community. The Niger continues to stand with the Palestinian people and supports all efforts that could lead to a comprehensive peace based on the two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestine living side by side in peace and security with Israel and neighbouring countries. We were therefore pleased to attend on 30 September the raising of the Palestinian flag alongside those of States Members at the United Nations.
Also in the Middle East, the wars raging in Syria, Iraq and Yemen are reasons for genuine concern. They have inflicted terrible suffering on civilians, who have been compelled to seek refuge elsewhere. This has created humanitarian crises embodied in the daily tragedy of immigrants in the Mediterranean Sea and along the eastern borders of Europe.
In Africa, the ongoing situation in South Sudan is yet another source of great concern, despite the agreement signed in August. In Burkina Faso, we welcome the successful resolution of the situation and the relaunch of the democratic transition thanks to the efforts of the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). In the Central African Republic, we welcome the Bangui Forum for National Reconciliation and call on all parties to implement its outcome. We express our great concern, however, on the subject of recent events that may undermine security and respect for the agreed agenda.
In Mali, despite the presence of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and Operation Barkhane, terrorist groups continue to carry out criminal acts against the civilian population and the peacekeeping forces. The signing on 20 June at Bamako of the Agreement
15-29822 15/29

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali was a crucial milestone in restoring peace, security and stability and in creating conditions conducive to economic and social development in that country. The effective implementation of the Agreement must be supported by the entire international community.
In Libya, the situation remains very alarming and require the international community to be further involved so as to persuade the Libyan people to reconcile and fight together against the terrorist groups sowing despair throughout the country. We see every day how their activities compromise efforts aimed at genuine national reconciliation, which is a sine qua non condition to restore peace and stability and ensure the economic and social development that the Libyan people legitimately deserve. That situation is also a serious threat to the security of the Niger, a neighbouring country, and the entire Sahelo-Saharan region. In regard, we sincerely hope that the United Nations-led peace process under Special Representative of the Secretary-General Bernardino León will be crowned with success.
To those general situations of conflict are also added violent extremism and international terrorism, which are increasingly taking on worrying dimensions with the acquisition of heavy weapons and the desire to conquer territories and destabilize the area to an unprecedented degree. However, we have to be pleased by the awareness on the part of the international community of the danger that represents, as well as by its commitment to face it. Whether it is the United Nations through the relevant resolutions of the Security Council or the actions of regional organizations and subregional organizations such as the African Union, ECOWAS, the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the European Union and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the international community is showing great mobilization to eradicate this scourge.
As for the Boko Haram sect, which is disturbing the peace in the Lake Chad Basin, it will certainly be defeated by the effective operation of the multilateral mixed force established by Cameroon, the Niger, Nigeria, Chad and the members of the Lake Chad Basin, as well as Benin. We would like to thank the members of the Security Council for the statement issued in August that urged the international community to contribute all the necessary support to the States of the region, in particular the members of the Lake Chad Basin Commission plus Benin. For its part, Niger is
actively committed to combating terrorism and, in close cooperation with its partners, has strengthened its national committee to combat all forms of terrorism as part of a regional and international undertaking to combat this scourge.
As the President of the Republic of the Niger, His Excellency Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou, said on the occasion of his speech to the audience at Harvard University on 3 April,
“The Clauswitz triad, people, government, army, which has always been sought in the past in so-called industrial wars, functions very well in asymmetric wars conducted by terrorists. While some claim to be carrying out jihad in the name of Allah, Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. Islam asks Muslims to seek knowledge and, as the Prophet has said, to do so as far as China, so as to learn from the cradle to the grave. The terrorists of Boko Haram, like all other terrorists, are not Muslims. On the contrary, they are the worst enemies of Islam. For those reasons, Boko Haram has no future and will be vanquished.”
With regard to human rights, since the adoption, on 10 December 1948, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights we have witnessed an impressive development of international law and human rights law through the conclusion of numerous international legal instruments covering almost all aspects, including new rights. At the same time, important progress has been made in the codification of international law.
With regard to the challenge of migration, we are delighted that the international community is concerned with dealing with this important issue appropriately and on a global basis. The Niger is a country of origin, a host country and a country of transit. We believe that is imperative to find immediate palliative solutions that will stop clandestine immigration, dismantle the criminal economy that underlies it and solve the problem by attacking the deep causes of migration in countries of origin, causes which are of a security nature, economic and climate and sometimes political due to bad governance.
In the area of economic and social development, the United Nations system, through the operational activities of its agencies, funds, programmes and specialized agencies, has provided technical assistance, capacity- building and development projects to developing countries. I am pleased to note that the United Nations
16/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
system has acted as a neutral and trusted partner in supporting Governments, while helping them with their leadership and to fulfil their international commitments and implement their development strategies.
The Niger acceded to the United Nations on 20 September 1960 under the sponsorship of Tunisia, which we commend for its constant friendship as we mark the seventieth anniversary of our common Organization. Ever since, the Niger has been resolutely committed to international solidarity. On this solemn occasion, we welcome the new turning point of the United Nations to go beyond the Millennium Development Goals and bring about the essential changes to our planet so that the Sustainable Development Goals do not just mean rhetoric, but a true commitment to sustainable global development.
A new commitment to act is a commitment for the peoples of the world, to whom we must provide peace, stability and development. It is a commitment to heighten the spirit of sharing and solidarity at the global level. It represents a driving force break down the barriers of inequality between and within nations. Finally, it is about building a more just and more human world. That is why the Niger believes that “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” must be implemented effectively.
The commitments that we have all signed on to have meaning only if they are part of active solidarity and renewed partnership. The United Nations system must be an important actor in the implementation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the 169 targets, including the means of implementation and the follow- up review mechanism. I hope that they will allow for progress beyond the Millennium Development Goals and contribute to meeting the challenges we face to reach the future we want, namely, economic, social and environmental well-being for all. I also hope that the Agenda’s implementation will take into account the close link existing between security, development and climate.
I also welcome the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development, adopted in July, wherein partners reaffirmed their commitment to support developing countries with a view to inclusive economic and social growth and sustainable development, in particular via increased, predictable and steady official development assistance and other public and private financing sources.
While the wounds left by the structural adjustment programmes of the 1980s and 1990s have not yet healed, the 2008 economic and financial crisis has gravely undermined the growth achieved during the 2000s. The economies of developing countries — in particular the most vulnerable among them, such as landlocked countries, least developed countries and small island developing States — have been the most affected. In that regard, I underscore the importance for us of the speeding up the comprehensive implementation of the commitments under the Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries and the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries.
We also hope that the Paris Climate Summit will produce a binding legal instrument that includes effective steps to mitigate the effects of climate change, including adaptation measures for these countries in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. At the same time, the commitments made with regard for the Green Climate Fund should be both respected stepped up. We welcome all the efforts that the French Government has made under the leadership of President François Hollande to guarantee the success of the upcoming historic climate meeting.
We must also redouble our efforts with regard to the commitments made under the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, the post-2015 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the measures to be decided at the twenty-first Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Niger is continuing to implement an economic and social development programme that runs through the end of this year. It aims at economic growth and access by all the people of the Niger to basic social services. A new development programme, known as Vision 2035, will follow thereafter, with a focus on inclusive growth. It is therefore important that there be an appropriate mobilization of financial means and assistance for capacity-building, the facilitation of trade, technology and private investment.
On the political front, we intend to entrench and enhance good democratic governance as an essential factor for all development. In that connection, in early 2016 we will hold a series of elections for the renewal of the mandates of our institutions. Our presidential, legislative and local elections will be transparent, free
15-29822 17/29

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
and inclusive. I invite all of our partners to support the Niger in that undertaking of consolidating democracy in my country.
The international system also needs democratic governance. That is particularly necessary because it is clearly recognized that the problems we are facing are on a worldwide scale, and therefore deserve responses of the same scope and through comprehensive multilateralism. The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations should be taken advantage of to examine how it functions and make progress in determining the necessary adjustments so that the Organization, and the Security Council in particular, will reflect the current reality of the world. Africa, which was not present when the United Nations was established because it was still under colonial domination, has to correct the historic injustice it has had with regard to its representation in the Security Council. In accordance with the Ezulwini Consensus, and in line with deliberations of the African Union, our continent should be represented in both categories of membership, with two permanent and five non-permanent seats. Furthermore, the General Assembly — the pre-eminent and most representative organ — should be revitalized so that it can play its role in finding solutions to the different challenges in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter.
The Niger believes in multilateralism, sustained solidarity among peoples and the virtues of dialogue among States. In line with those principles, we commend the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba and hope that the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations will coincide with the end of an economic embargo against Cuba’s people that is so unfair.
"
70,2015,SVN,"We are at a historic junction for the United Nations, which will turn 70 next month. This occasion is an opportunity for stocktaking of the Organization’s past achievements, missed opportunities and challenges ahead. The United Nations has been making outstanding efforts in paving the road ahead for peace, security and human rights. At the same time, profound changes have taken place in these seven decades. The United Nations has been successful in adapting to some, whereas it lacked creativity, political will and flexibility to effectively face others.
Ten years ago, leaders met here in New York with a vision to increase and promote international security and advance human rights and development with a bold plan known as the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document, which led to the establishment of the Human Rights Council and Peacebuilding Commission. We collectively endorsed the concept of the responsibility to protect human beings from mass atrocities and systematic violations of human rights. We have also committed to reform the Security Council, as well to revitalize the General Assembly, as part of a comprehensive, overall reform of the Organization. The United Nations has to continue to adapt to new challenges, and it would therefore be important to make progress in that respect. We have the mandate and responsibility to act, based on global solidarity and the vision of a fairer and more secure international community.
We welcome the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). However, by the end of
15-29568 27/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
the year, at the twenty-first session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference, in Paris, we will need to adopt an ambitious, durable, universal and legally binding climate agreement that addresses mitigation, adaptation, financing and technology development in a balanced and cost-effective manner.
Slovenia remains strongly engaged in protecting the environment and in ensuring its sustainability, both in national and international contexts. Based on our extensive experience with beekeeping, and in view of multiple threats to bee populations, we wish to raise awareness of the critical importance of bees for sustainable food production and biodiversity. The Slovenian Government therefore decided to propose the proclamation of “World Bee Day”, for which we will seek the endorsement of the United Nations.
There can be no security or economic and social development without respect for human rights, and vice versa. I wish to express our support for the excellent work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, and to encourage him to continue to exercise his leadership in the field of human rights. Almost a quarter of a century ago, when Slovenia gained independence, respect for human rights was a pivotal founding principle of our newly formed State. Since then, our commitment to promoting human rights, especially by protecting the most vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly, has intensified and represents one of the core elements of our foreign policy. Slovenia will continue to advocate a progressive approach to human rights issues and strive to enhance international norms and standards. We are confident that we can also successfully contribute to that goal by serving as a member of the Human Rights Council from 2016 to 2018.
This year is particularly significant for women, since it marks the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Just a few days ago we participated in the event commemorating it and reaffirmed our commitment to gender equality, human rights and the empowerment of women. And in October we will mark the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), the first resolution to stress the role of women in peace and security. But while we acknowledge the progress that has been achieved, our quest for gender equality must continue.
Respect for the rule of law and international law is an essential condition for nations’ development and peaceful coexistence. One of the aims of the United Nations, enshrined in its Charter, is that of working to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained. Slovenia believes firmly in the paramount importance of international treaties. It is through them that we can enhance universality, ensure reliability and provide accountability. Every society should make justice, truth and reconciliation a major focus and strive to attain them by every possible means, including international courts and tribunals. We continue our strong support to the International Criminal Court, which plays an important role in affirming the rule of law. Slovenia will continue to advocate for a strong and independent Court as well as for the universality of the Rome Statute and the Kampala amendments, and we call on States to cooperate fully and promptly with the Court. But the primary responsibility for prosecuting international crimes rests with States. Slovenia is actively engaged in efforts to ensure mutual legal assistance and extradition agreements between States for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide, through the initiative in that regard.
Time and again, no matter how often we insist that mass atrocities and systematic violations of human rights should not be repeated, we still witness events that shock the conscience. In the past few years we have witnessed war in Syria and raging conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Gaza, Yemen, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and elsewhere, with spillover effects in their immediate neighbourhoods and consequences felt around the world. Such situations have been worsened by the escalating violent extremism and crimes committed by Daesh and other terrorist groups and organizations. This must be stopped. We call on the Security Council, and its permanent members in particular, to overcome their divisions and find a way to deal more effectively with the deteriorating situation, in line with the Council’s primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.
Nor has Europe as a continent been spared. The conflict in Ukraine goes on and its sovereignty and territorial integrity remain under threat. We therefore call for the full and timely implementation of the Minsk agreements.

These wars and conflicts have dramatically increased the displacement of people on a large scale, reaching levels unprecedented in recent history. We are faced with immense humanitarian challenges. Refugees and migrants are fleeing their homes in massive waves, and hundreds are dying in their quest for a better life. The magnitude of the current humanitarian crisis requires a determined and immediate response on the part of the entire international community, based on the common principles of solidarity, humanity and shared responsibility. We should help these people in need. We should increase assistance to countries that are hosting large numbers of refugees. We should also act more decisively in refugees’ countries of origin by pushing for sustainable political solutions to ongoing conflicts and by countering the spread of radical ideologies.
Slovenia is committed to conflict prevention and peaceful conflict resolution. Wherever possible and applicable, we should opt for diplomacy, mediation and conflict prevention. The recent historic agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue proves that even the most complex issues can be resolved peacefully. Considering that positive outcome, we hope that the Middle East peace talks will also resume soon, with a view to bringing stability and security to this tormented region.
With regard to disarmament and arms control, I would like to welcome the early entry into force, last December, of the Arms Trade Treaty and to call for its full implementation. That will enable us to regulate the international arms trade effectively, and thus make a substantial contribution to international peace and security. My country also remains committed to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.
I would like to conclude by underlining that Slovenia will continue with activities aimed at bringing the global community closer to achieving universal standards of human rights and a decent life for all. We will remain a strong supporter of an environment in which every human being can feel safe. We will continue to advocate for strong partnerships, inclusive dialogue and constructive cooperation. We are determined to work with all partners to ensure that the Organization delivers tangible, meaningful results that can advance peace, security and human rights for all. Slovenia will do its share in shouldering its responsibility to act.
"
70,2015,ROU,"My delegation would like to congratulate the President on his assuming the presidency of this important session. We have found inspiration in the theme of the session: “The United Nations at 70 — a new commitment to action”. Allow me also to express my appreciation to Denmark, an example of true dedication to the work of the

Organization and one of the very few Members that have met the commitment to allocate 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic product for official development assistance.
The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations is yet another opportunity for a lucid reflection on the lessons learned and the future of our Organization. What we have seen is a visionary project born from the ashes of a terrible tragedy, with the lofty goal of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. We have seen a working agenda that has continuously expanded into new areas of cooperation, within and beyond its main pillars, namely, peace and security, development and human rights. We have witnessed the continuous efforts of the Organization and its Member States to adapt to new challenges and to major shifts in the paradigm of international relations. As a consequence, the United Nations has steadily developed new mandates, reaching a level of complexity never seen before. Of course, the United Nations is not a panacea for all the evils of humankind. Its history is one of ups and downs, achievements and failures. At the same time, we all know that the increasing number and depth of the tasks entrusted to it have not been matched by the resources needed to accomplish all of its goals. It has become common practice to ask the United Nations to do more with less.
The Charter of the United Nations, after 70 years of being tested against all winds, has proved to be a visionary document that has stood the test of history. The Charter was drafted as a solid corpus of principles and norms for international conduct. It was conceived in an intelligent manner that allowed enough flexibility for designing the actual ways and means to cope with increasingly complex situations. The United Nations has steadily consolidated its universal vocation and legitimacy. It has created and promoted an impressive body of international law that touches on almost all domains of international cooperation. It may occasionally have been convenient for some Member States or other stakeholders to point to the failures of the Organization. We should try harder to point to the magnitude of the prevention work carried out by the Organization. Prevention being admittedly much more difficult to measure, we have tended to underestimate its importance among the achievements of the Organization. In the same vein, it is worth reminding ourselves that the United Nations is neither an organization born out of the blue nor an independent
and self-ruling entity. The United Nations is nothing but we ourselves, the Member States, living in the trust and resources we invest in it.
Romania is among the countries that have fully trusted and unconditionally supported the United Nations. The year 2015 is a special one for my country, because this year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of Romania’s admission to the Organization. The United Nations has helped Romania in various ways over various periods of the post-Second World War era. In the beginning, despite having been part of the monolithic group of former Communist countries, Romania found in those years, a propitious framework, here in the United Nations, within which to assert its national independence and to make friends and partners throughout the world. Later on, the United Nations provided my country with the opportunity to engage in the debates over and action on global issues through dialogue and cooperation across all continents. In the aftermath of the Cold War, the United Nations was actively engaged in supporting Romania during its difficult economic transformation and the transition towards democracy. The funds and programmes of the United Nations assisted Romania in addressing social problems related to children, population, health and the environment, along with many others. Allow me, in particular, to thank the United Nations Development Programme for its 45-year presence in my country.
Our sixtieth anniversary allows us to take a retrospective look. Romania is a country with limited economic power. Nonetheless, we take pride in having made some significant contributions to United Nations goals throughout our six decades of membership. In essence, they were based on a reliance on multilateral diplomacy and international law and the pre-eminence of peaceful means over the use of force in the pursuit of national interests.
Romania has often been at the frontline of major United Nations campaigns. I would like to highlight just a few of the topics that were the focus of initiatives undertaken by Romania in the General Assembly, the Security Council and the various human rights bodies. They include, inter alia, arms control and disarmament, good relations among neighbouring States, the role of science and technology in development, a more effective and influential role for youth, increased cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations and arrangements, and the promotion and consolidation of democracy. Since 1991, Romanian contingents have
15-29431 17/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
participated in peacekeeping operations across all continents from Angola to Cambodia, from Somalia to Haiti, and from the former Yugoslavia to Rwanda. Moreover, Romania hosts the Institute for the Protection and the Security of the Citizen, which contributes to the training of special categories of United Nations peacekeepers.
Since 2008, Romania has been part of one of the most innovative arrangements for the protection of refugees through its hosting of the first Emergency Transit Centre in Timişoara, as a result of an agreement with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration. After almost two decades as a recipient, Romania has thus itself become a provider of official development assistance to countries in our neighbourhood and beyond.
On the occasion of its seventieth anniversary, the United Nations does not need to prove the legitimacy of its actions. What the Organization needs is a strengthened capacity and readiness to act and galvanize the political will of Member States, so as to be able to further enhance its role in maintaining international peace and security and in delivering global public goods. That role is, once again, being dramatically tested these days.
The United Nations is called upon to make, in concert with regional organizations and individual States, new commitments to the fight against terrorism in all its manifestations — whether they be the cowardly crimes against innocent people, the barbarous destruction of the common cultural heritage of humankind, or the unprecedented and abhorrent form of terrorism developed by what is known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, whose actions constitute clear violations of international law and human rights, which we are striving so hard to uphold.
At this juncture, let me reiterate Romania’s support for the initiative of France and Mexico to propose a collective and voluntary agreement among the permanent members of the Security Council regarding the non-use of the veto when action is needed to prevent or bring to an end situations of mass atrocities and war crimes on a large scale. Ten years after the endorsement of the responsibility to protect, we should continue to support that responsibility by identifying the best ways to understand, implement and operationalize it.
The current massive waves of migration are just one of the worrisome consequences of the internal and international conflicts in the Middle East and Southern Mediterranean region. That phenomenon requires more than just responses to the immediate humanitarian needs of refugees. The United Nations must also address, in a realistic and energetic manner, the root causes of migration. We should stop the destruction of the social fabric of conflict-torn societies, help populations escape their extreme poverty, help youth regain their hope for a better future, and help individuals rebuild their dignity. Through official development assistance (ODA), the United Nations should play a much stronger role in that respect. For that to happen, a thorough reform of ODA may probably be needed.
The United Nations should be less lenient in respect to the protracted conflicts in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, in Georgia and in Nagorno Karabakh. Where the status quo is characterized by conditions that are contrary to international law, the situation will always be fragile and possibly conducive to occasional outbreaks of violence. In addition, our non-action in such situations creates the wrong impression that unlawful territorial gains — to the detriment of independent and sovereign States — are possible and tolerated. That is the case with the situation in Ukraine, in which the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, have not taken the action expected, as defined by the terms of the Charter of the United Nations. We call upon all members of the Security Council to act responsibly and decide in the interest of international peace and security and in accordance with international law, while addressing the situation in Ukraine.
Romania wholeheartedly welcomes the agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme. That agreement proves that nothing is impossible, if there is a genuine political will and there are visionary statesmen engaged in bold action. We also praise the role so ably and diligently played in that connection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The agreement with regard to that long-standing problem proves once again the virtues of diplomacy and negotiations undertaken in good faith and with patience, with the support of the expertise developed within the United Nations system. We hope to see more, ancillary benefits of that agreement in the broader context of the Middle East peace process.
I would like to call upon all States Members of the United Nations not to miss the opportunity to conclude
18/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
a new and ambitious binding agreement in response to climate change. The moment is still auspicious, in view of the commitments of the European Union, as well as the massive activism on the part of civil society. The example of the European Union is expected to be followed by other major contributors to global warming. People everywhere and, in particular, those in the small island countries, whose very physical existence is threatened, are waiting for new commitments, before it is too late.
Beyond the thematic and geographical configuration of United Nations diplomacy, we believe that the nuts and bolts of our Organization can be found in the codification and progressive development of international law. Romania believes that international law and international justice are fundamental values for humankind. We should never cease to act to promote the reaffirmation and consolidation of the principles of international law, which represent a landmark of our society of nations for all time.
The sixtieth anniversary of Romania’s admission to the United Nations is being marked as an important step concerning our commitment to international justice. Romania became the seventy-second Member State to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. Our declaration, submitted to the Secretary-General on 23 June, is a continuation of the interwar tradition of my country to conduct its international relations in full compliance with international law.
The consolidation of international justice and the need to put an end to impunity should trigger a strengthened legal approach to international terrorism. Terrorism represents the worst in crimes against individuals and societies. Romania believes that the international community should do more to combat terrorism with the tools of the law, including international criminal law. It is with that purpose in mind that Romania and Spain have set in motion a process of reflection on the possible creation of an international court for the crime of terrorism. We are fully aware of the conceptual and operational difficulties of such an undertaking. However, the values that stand behind that reflection, which are aimed at strengthening the rule of law in our multilateral antiterrorist drive, are likely to generate fresh ideas for innovative legal tools. We believe that that reflection process is worthwhile in its own right, as it will fuel the debate on reinforcing the values of justice and international law. I would like to
take this opportunity to invite all interested delegations to engage in good-faith discussions about how to implement those values in the fight against terrorism.
"
70,2015,SDN,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. We trust that his expertise and efficiency will guide our deliberations in achieving the goals to which we all aspire. I express my thanks and appreciation to his predecessor for his patient and clear- sighted manner in steering our deliberations. I also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his team for their commendable efforts at the previous session to establish peace and advance the development goals so that all peoples can enjoy security and stability.
I take this opportunity to congratulate the President, Government and people of the State of Palestine on the raising of the Palestinian flag at United Nations Headquarters, and we call on the international community to enable the Palestinian people to establish their free and independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

On behalf of the Government and people of the Sudan, I convey to the Assembly the greetings of the President of the Republic, Field Marshall Omar Hassan A. Al-Bashir, and reiterate our intention to contribute positively to the success of this important session of the General Assembly, which coincides with the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations under the slogan “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”.
Clearly, the agenda for our debate this year reflects the concerns and aspirations of millions of people around the world for a better tomorrow and a brighter future, from surmounting crises caused by conflicts and hostilities in many hotspots around the world to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) . For all those reasons, humankind has great hopes for our upcoming discussion based on the solid foundation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which we adopted last week.
The Government of the Sudan paid close attention to the intergovernmental negotiations on the post- 2015 development agenda, which culminated in the document adopted after lengthy negotiations. We therefore welcome the adoption of the document, in whose negotiations we participated. The Sudan has begun to implement measures with a view to attaining those Goals. The Agenda has been mainstreamed into our national and regional programmes. We want to bolster the complementary role of the United Nations, its country teams, relevant funds and agencies, whose role in implementing those plans we commend.
However, we reaffirm our resolve to ensure that those Goals complement the process of peace, stability and growth in our country, despite the fact that we remain subject to unilateral coercive economic sanctions that hinder our ambitions to achieve those noble Goals. From this rostrum, we strongly reject the coercive and unilateral sanctions imposed on certain countries, as clearly and explicitly stated in the Agenda.
In the wake of signing and implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005 and the signing of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur in 2011, the Sudan had great expectations that the international community would give special consideration to its overarching concerns and economic problems, especially regarding the alleviation of the debt burden that is a serious economic impediment. With regard to resuming development aid, the Sudan
also anticipates treatment equal to that enjoyed by other countries emerging from conflicts.
However, to its utmost dismay, my country’s reward for achieving peace and stability and for all its sacrifices has been endless, politically motivated pressure, sanctions, boycotts and unilateral and coercive measures that lack any legal justification whatsoever. To make matters even worse, obstacles have been set up to bar the Sudan from benefiting from certain constructive initiatives, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, also for purely political reasons unrelated to reality.
Despite the unfavourable conditions created by the embargo and boycott that unfairly target our people, we have made strenuous efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and have given high priority to the elimination of poverty in its various manifestations and the mitigation of its effects. However, our gains in increasing per capita income have been offset by the fallout from the independence of South Sudan, after which the optimal share of our oil revenues went to the fledgling State, in addition to the negative effects of the global economic crisis and the economic embargo.
Despite those difficulties, we have achieved reasonable success in educational services. Enrolment rates in basic and secondary education have greatly increased, as has the proportion of female students, reflecting our growing interest in female education following the implementation of national incentive policies and awareness programmes. The growth in the proportion of female students coupled with a State gender policy have led to a marked increase in the female employment rates, which significantly exceed those of men in some sectors, such as health care.
With regard to the maintenance of peace and security, my Government is on track to consolidate democracy and good governance. As Member States might have seen, the presidential and parliamentary elections conducted in the Sudan last April were peaceful, fair and transparent and were monitored by a number of regional and international centres. The people elected a President and members of Parliament and other legislative bodies throughout the country for the first time in the history of modern Sudan since its independence in 1956.
We recall the comprehensive national dialogue initiative launched by the President of the Republic on 27 January 2014, to which a total of 87 political parties
15-29816 43/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
responded positively. All agreed to meet and discuss issues pertaining to peace, the economy, the alleviation of poverty, unity, identity, foreign policy, civic rights and duties, human rights, freedoms and political practices.
Member States might also have taken note of the adequate and effective safeguards guaranteed by the Government to the remnants of the armed rebel groups in a bid to secure their safe participation in the dialogue, without restriction or precondition. In that context, on 21 September 2014 the President of the Republic issued two presidential decrees on the renewal of amnesty for all armed individuals and the extension of a unilateral moratorium for an additional two months as an incentive to the armed groups and individuals to participate in the comprehensive national dialogue process, which is open to all.
With regard to safeguarding human rights, the Government of the Sudan has made commendable achievements in the past and has taken many steps to safeguard and protect those rights, including the adoption, more than one year ago, of a comprehensive 10-year human rights development plan, which now represents a comprehensive strategy and course of action for all relevant ministries and State institutions.
With regard to the protection of women’s rights, especially their right to participate in political life, the aforementioned presidential and parliamentary elections bear witness to the inclusion of women, which proved to be critical at all stages to ensuring the success of the elections. Women hold 30 per cent of all parliamentary seats.
In respect of cooperation with United Nations mechanisms and relevant envoys, the Government of the Sudan maintains constant cooperation and coordination with the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan and participates actively in the universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council in Geneva.
In the field of combating cross-border crime, the Government of the Sudan has signed several bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries, including Libya, Chad, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Ethiopia, with a view to tightening border controls, preventing trafficking in arms and stopping the infiltration of organized crime, including trafficking in persons. In October 2014 my Government hosted and co-organized the Regional Conference on Human
Trafficking and Smuggling in the Horn of Africa, and has enacted a national law to combat trafficking in human beings, which entered into force last year.
Our discussion on human rights brings us back to the issue of unilateral sanctions, in the context of which we would like to mention the study conducted by the Human Rights Council two years ago on the human rights implications of such sanctions. The study concluded that innocent people, not Governments, are the primary victims of sanctions regimes.
The Sudan has always been an active partner in international efforts to combat terrorism. At the national level, we have made considerable progress in ensuring that our laws and legislation fully comply with international law and the international instruments on terrorism to which the Sudan became a party more than a decade ago. The Sudan adheres strictly to their norms and provisions.
In that connection, we categorically reject all attempts to politicize and circumvent the provisions of international law. I cite the relationship between the Security Council and the International Criminal Court, in respect of which experience has shown again and again that the scourge of politicization has turned the Court into a tool for targeting African leaders in particular. In that regard, members may have noted the decisions adopted by the African Union, notably those adopted at its Summits in Sirte, Libya, and in Addis Ababa, which were subsequently endorsed at the most recent Summit, in Johannesburg.
Our world will not be healed in the absence of a fair, equitable and universally acceptable international order. However, it has been clear for decades that the current international system can no longer cope with the developments and major transformations occurring worldwide. It is therefore imperative that we embark on an in-depth reform and reconsider agreements in accordance with the circumstances surrounding us today. Therefore, my country strongly calls for the expeditious implementation of structural reform of the United Nations and the Security Council, in conformity with the principle of fair and equitable representation of all countries.
The daunting challenges facing our world today require an overriding international will and demonstrate the urgent need to do more to meet them. That fact needs to be reiterated on the anniversary of the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations. The
44/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
United Nations system, and the Security Council in particular, need reform that will ensure the African continent’s representation in the permanent and non-permanent seats of the Council in a process free of politicization, selectivity and double standards.
In that context, we note that the fight against impunity is a noble goal, around which the international community should converge in good faith. However, as a rule, mixing justice and politicization is inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. It makes
the delivery of international justice a platform for achieving narrow political goals that have no relation whatsoever to those noble objectives. In that context, my delegation calls for strengthening and supporting regional mechanisms and enhancing preventive diplomacy to address all conflicts and their root causes within the framework of fighting poverty and achieving a fair balance in the field of international politics and economics.
"
70,2015,TJK,"It is a great pleasure to join other delegations in expressing our cordial congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session.
The current session of the General Assembly offers a unique opportunity not only to acknowledge the accomplishments of the United Nations over the last 70 years, but also to reiterate our strong commitment to meeting the aspirations and hopes of our peoples for secure and sustainable development. For 70 years, the United Nations has stood for peace and security, international cooperation and human rights. Over this short but intense period of history, the United Nations has made great strides in promoting stability and sustainable development and in reducing or even eliminating poverty and inequality all over the world. During this period, the mechanisms for interaction that we have set up together to facilitate international cooperation have functioned with considerable success. Recently, the United Nations Summit adopted the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which lays the foundation for and identifies the
areas in which the international community can work to attain sustainable development that would meet the interests of all peoples and every individual.
Over seven decades, the United Nations has made a remarkable contribution to assisting in the formation of new independent States and their further development. When, at the dawn of its independence, Tajikistan was faced with the difficulties of transition, it received extensive support from the United Nations, which enabled the country to embark on the road towards democratic development. The major pillars of Tajikistan’s development, laid down with the assistance of the United Nations, contributed to the country’s ability to participate in international processes set up to foster cooperation and interaction. Today, Tajikistan is contributing significantly to fighting terrorism and extremism, transnational organized crime, illicit drug trafficking, arms smuggling and human trafficking, and in promotion of the United Nations water agenda.
Our national police officers are participating in United Nations and African Union peacekeeping operations in Darfur and are contributing to peacebuilding processes shoulder to shoulder with colleagues from other Member States. Our drug control agency that was established with United Nations support continues to play an important role in combating illicit drug trafficking. Indeed, since 1995, Tajikistan’s national drug enforcement authorities have confiscated more than 111 metric tons of narcotics, an amount equivalent to 206,650,000 drug doses, which could turn 50 million people the world over into drug abusers. This data proves that Tajikistan ranks among the world’s top 10 States in the seizure of illicit drugs.
The world has undergone dramatic transformation in the last decades. Global processes are more dynamic and complex than ever. Along with the positive contributions globalization has made to overall development, globalization has also had negative impacts that threaten security and development in individual countries and in the world as a whole.
The increase in the number of armed conflicts and acts of terror, food, energy and financial and economic crises, degradation of the environment, climate change and the spread of infectious diseases demand from us a concerted and comprehensive response. In this context, the United Nations remains the key platform for consensus on the key issues of international security and development and for coordination of joint action
8/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
of the international community towards responding to global threats and challenges. Of special concern are the scope and global nature of the current threats posed by terrorism, drug-trafficking and organized crime. The destructive and inhumane forces of terrorism and extremism have continued to gain in strength, attracting into their orbit an ever-growing number of young people. Those forces seriously undermine efforts of countries and regions to maintain the security and peaceful development.
Combating international terrorism and extremism has become a top priority. There is an undeniable need to develop national, regional and international mechanisms to eliminate military infrastructure, block channels of financial and logistical support, prevent recruiting and propaganda that promotes violence, and counteract the use of modern information and communication technologies for the purpose of terror. It is also essential that we pool our efforts to find ways to address the issues of poverty reduction and the negative impact of globalization, and to prevent and resolve regional conflicts. Strengthening cross-cultural and interfaith dialogue, mutual trust and tolerance would play a pivotal role.
It is in our common interests for Member States to implement the United Nations Global Counter- Terrorism Strategy and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council in order to effectively combat all forms and manifestations of terrorism, including the use of the Internet for terrorist activities. Any joint response to a sudden outbreak of terrorism and extremism should be commensurate with the scope of that threat.
The prevention of drug-trafficking, which has unfortunately continued to increase yearly, should become an integral part of our common struggle against terrorism and global organized crime. Money earned from drug-trafficking is channelled to financing acts of terror and organized crime activities. In that context, the special session on drugs to be held in 2016 will offer an opportunity not only to review the implementation of the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem, but also to develop new and effective measures for combating that evil. In the light of those efforts, in May Tajikistan held a high-level international conference on drug control that sought to consolidate international cooperation on counter-narcotics.
Our friendly neighbouring nation of Afghanistan has embarked on the implementation of its transformation decade. The new stage of enhancing and reinforcing the security and stability of the country and the rehabilitation of its economic and social sectors is being accompanied by addressing the most urgent and practical issues, which requires increasing the targeted assistance of the international community, in which the United Nations should play a central and coordinating role. Tajikistan is in favour of expanding friendly and good-neighbourly relations with Afghanistan and calls on the international community to support the efforts of the Government of that country to achieve peace and stability by addressing the social and economic challenges that the country faces, pursuing the process of national reconciliation and inclusive dialogue, and involving the country in regional cooperation. Tajikistan continues to make its contribution to the social and economic development of Afghanistan.
The peaceful solution of the issue of the Iranian nuclear programme demonstrated the enormous potential of diplomatic means to resolve the urgent problems of our shared planet. We are convinced that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran’s nuclear programme, enshrined in Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), will contribute to the strengthening of regional and international peace, genuine stability and mutual trust and be instrumental in reinforcing the nuclear non-proliferation regime. We hope that United Nations Member States will be guided by good will and resolve to resolve the most urgent disputes and conflicts, by using political and diplomatic means, in addressing other urgent issues.
Last July, Tajikistan hosted regional consultations for the countries of South and Central Asia in preparation of the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 in Istanbul. We hope that the recommendations voiced at those consultations will have a positive effect on the humanitarian activities of all countries.
In December, the international community will meet again at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris to conclude the round of negotiations on climate change that we began in Bali. We hope that Member States will take advantage of that opportunity and adopt a new document on climate change, based on the principles of the Framework Convention and, by so doing, lay the foundations of a transition to sustainable development. We believe that such a transition will
15-29431 9/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
require not only industrial modernization, based on innovative technologies, but also significant changes in mentalities and consumption patterns.
The long-term observations of our experts attest to the increased impact of climate change on the environmental, social and economic situation in our country and region. According to those observations, over the past 60 years the average annual temperature in Tajikistan has increased by 1°C, the number of days with heavy precipitation has risen, natural meteorological disasters have become more frequent and severe, and the degradation of glaciers has accelerated. This past summer, as a result of the abnormally high temperature and severe precipitation, the mountainous part of the country suffered natural disasters that caused hundreds of millions of United States dollars in economic damage. Regrettably, these disasters also claimed human lives.
In terms of carbon dioxide emissions, Tajikistan ranks one hundred and thirty-fifth among greenhouse gas-emitting countries. Per capita greenhouse gas emissions in the country is 10 times less than that of the average world index. Widespread use of renewable energy sources — predominantly hydropower — would facilitate the economic and social development of the country and promote the “green economy”.
It is becoming apparent that climate change affects the quantity and quality of freshwater resources. It is known that as a result of climate change, the amount of water resources stored in glaciers and snow caps has diminished, the area of ground waters affected by salinization has increased, and precipitation has become more frequent and heavier. In turn, the changes in the hydrological cycle may have a negative impact on water, energy and food security and entail an added risk of floods and extreme droughts. We believe that in such circumstances, it is essential to review existing practices of water-resource management in order to ensure adequate adaptation not only to climate change, but also to population growth and a changing world economy, as well as to the scarcity of freshwater resources.
In Central Asia, where water resources are a key factor in achieving the sustainable development of the region, the need for the elaboration of a comprehensive regional plan of adaptation to climate change became urgent long ago. This imperative is also driven by the accelerated degradation of the glaciers in the region as a result of climate change. The observations of expert
confirm that, since the 1960s, the region’s glaciers, which remain the main source of water for Central Asian rivers, have been degraded by a factor of three.
As 2015 is the final year of the International Decade for Action, “Water for Life”, 2005-2015, a global initiative approved by the General Assembly to facilitate the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, a number of water forums have been held to review progress and analyse gaps in the implementation of the International Decade. Such forums include the General Assembly high-level interactive dialogue for a comprehensive review of the progress on the implementation of the International Decade, held last March here in New York, and a high- level international conference on the implementation of the International Decade held in Dushanbe, in June. We expect that, in taking stock of the results of the Decade, the United Nations will take on board the outcomes of these events and other relevant forums held in support of a comprehensive review of the implementation of the Decade.
I take this opportunity to extend my deep appreciation to the Member States, the President of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General, the United Nations agencies and institutions, international organizations, and representatives of civil society, academia and business for actively participating in and implementing the Decade and for following up its outcomes.
A few days ago, we adopted a road map for achieving sustainable development that comprehensively incorporates the water component. Over the next 15 years, against the backdrop of the ever-increasing impact of climate change on water resources, environmental degradation, population growth and food and energy crises, we will have to make enormous efforts to ensure the timely achievement of the goals we have set forth.
In our view, fostering cooperation, partnership and water diplomacy will promote the timely adoption of relevant measures to mitigate the impact of destructive processes and help to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, there is a need for additional platforms for strengthening cooperation at all levels with the engagement of all interested stakeholders. In this regard, and given the positive outcomes of previous joint initiatives, we propose to consider the possibility of proclaiming a new international water decade, aimed
10/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
at promoting the implementation of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We sincerely hope that all States Members of the United Nations will lend their support to make this initiative a reality.
"
70,2015,IRN,"I am speaking on behalf of a great nation, which is mourning the loss of thousands of Muslim pilgrims and hundreds of its own citizens. Old, young, men and women, who had come together in the grand and global spiritual gathering of the hajj, unfortunately fell victim to the incompetence and mismanagement of those in charge. Owing to that incompetence on the part of the latter, even the missing cannot be identified, and the expeditious return of the bodies of the deceased to their mourning families has been prevented.
The magnitude of a calamity in which thousands of innocent people from the four corners of the world were killed or injured is such that it cannot be dealt with as though it were a natural disaster or a local issue. The pain and emotional distress inflicted on millions of Muslims is too great to be repaired by material means alone. Public opinion demands that Saudi Arabian officials promptly fulfil their international obligations and grant immediate consular access, with a view to the expeditious identification and return of the cherished bodies and remains. Moreover, arrangements must be made for there to be an independent and exhaustive inquiry into the causes of that disaster, which should include proposals for ways of preventing future recurrences.
I am speaking on behalf of a nation that, two years ago, voted for constructive engagement with the world, and I can now proudly announce that a new chapter has started in Iran’s relations with the world today. Two years ago, the people of Iran, voting in a competitive election, gave me a mandate to consolidate peace and constructive engagement with the world, while pursuing national rights, interests and security. That national will manifested itself through a careful and clear diplomatic effort, which resulted in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, concluded between the Islamic Republic of Iran and six world Powers and the European Union. That Plan of Action became an international instrument when the Security Council adopted resolution 2231 (2015). From the standpoint of international law, the instrument sets a valuable precedent, as the two sides, rather than warring and then negotiating peace, engaged in a process of dialogue and mutual understanding before a conflict could break out.
I would like to take the opportunity to recognize the role of all the negotiators in achieving that agreement. We had opted for creating a new environment, while maintaining our principles, and we succeeded in that undertaking. Where necessary, we moved forward, and, where necessary, we showed the courage for flexibility. For each point, we relied extensively on international law and showcased the potential of an approach based on constructive dialogue.
The key to a successful dialogue is remembering that any actor in the international system who pursues maximum demands and fails to allow space for the other side cannot hope to speak of peace, stability and development. As in commerce and economic activity, so also in politics and international relations: the interests of both parties have to be taken into account, and multilateralism and win-win solutions should provide the basis of engagement.
The United Nations was established to sustain global peace and security after two World Wars. Unfortunately, it has to be acknowledged that, in most cases, this important international institution has not been successful or effective. This time, however, the United Nations made the right decision, notwithstanding the fact that it earlier had adopted unfair resolutions against the Islamic Republic of Iran and imposed sanctions against the Iranian nation and Government, as a result of misunderstandings and, sometimes, the overt hostility of some countries. But we believe that, as an old Iranian saying goes, the sooner the harm
stops, the more benefit you will reap. Today is when that harm stopped.
Resolution 2231 (2015), despite several significant shortcomings, is an important development. It is the basis for terminating sanctions and no longer adopting resolutions hostile to Iran. We consider the past conduct of the Security Council to be unfair and stress that Iran, owing to the important fatwa of its leader and its defence doctrine, has never harboured the intention of producing a nuclear weapon. Therefore, resolutions imposing sanctions against Iran were unjust and illegal. The sanctions imposed by the Security Council and the unilateral sanctions imposed by some countries were based on deluded and baseless allegations and created difficult conditions for our people. But those sanctions never in any way affected the policy that we adopted and the approach that we took towards negotiations.
We proved in those negotiations that there is nothing on Iran’s agenda other than logic, reason, ethics, and — where necessary — legitimate and resolute self- defence against any kind of aggression. Consequently, the United States of America ultimately had no option but to choose negotiations and discussion over pressure and sanctions. Our seven countries and the European Union expended considerable time and diplomatic capital in those negotiations and should therefore exert their utmost efforts to protect and implement the agreement. We deem the compliance of all parties with their commitments to be the fundamental factor in the success of the implementation process of the negotiated agreement.
Parallel to the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, we also expect the nuclear-weapon States to take the necessary steps to fulfil their commitment to full nuclear disarmament, based on article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Furthermore, we expect them to play a positive role in the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East and not to allow the Zionist regime to remain an impediment to achieving that important objective.
The recently concluded nuclear deal, which is a brilliant example of “victory over war”, has managed to disperse the clouds of hostility and far-reaching tensions in the Middle East — and even perhaps the spectre of another war. The deal can and should herald a new era and lead to positive outcomes with regard to the establishment of sustainable peace and stability in the region. From our point of view, the agreed deal
is not the final objective but a development that can and should be the basis for further arrangements to come. Considering the fact that the deal has created an objective basis for implementation and has set an appropriate model, it can serve as the grounds for foundational change in the region.
Our policy is to continue to make peace-seeking efforts in the region, based on the same win-win principle, and to act in ways that would enable the region — and the world — to benefit from the new conditions. We will take this opportunity to look to the future and stop focusing on the past and rebuild our relationships with the countries in the region, particularly our neighbours, on the basis of mutual respect and our common and collective interests.
Unfortunately, the Middle East and North Africa have turned into one of the world’s most turbulent regions. With the continuation and intensification of current conditions, the turmoil could spread to other parts of the world. In today’s interconnected and borderless world, countries and regions are encountering great difficulty in protecting their borders and preventing the spread of insecurity and instability.
The gravest and most important threat to the world today is the possibility of terrorist organizations becoming terrorist States. We would consider it unfortunate for national uprisings in our region to be hijacked by terrorists and for the destiny of nations to be determined by arms and terror rather than by the ballot box. We propose that the fight against terrorism be incorporated into a binding international instrument and that no country be allowed to use terrorism for the purposes of interfering in the affairs of other countries. We are prepared to assist in the eradication of terrorism, in paving the way for democracy and in ensuring that arms do not dictate the course of events in the region.
As we assisted in the establishment of democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan, we are prepared to help bring about democracy in Syria and Yemen. We support the consolidation of power through elections, rather than through arms. We defend the rule of the majority that respects the rights of minorities.
Today, while safeguarding its historic and cultural heritage, Iran is looking to the future — not only the distant future but also the near future, with a bright outlook for cooperation and coexistence. I say to all nations and Governments that we will not forget the past, but we do not wish to live in the past. We will
not forget war and sanctions but we look to peace and development. Through the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, we were not just seeking a nuclear deal. We wanted to suggest a new and constructive way of recreating the international order, an order based on mutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs of others and sustained cooperation and coexistence among the States Members of the United Nations.
To build a peaceful future, we must learn our lessons from the bitter past. We know that the only way to bring about lasting peace is through development. Peace without development can only be a time out during which resentment and suspicion build. However, peace with development makes it possible for anger and resentment to dissipate and be replaced by hope and respect for others. We have repeatedly said that the only way to uproot terrorism in the Middle East is by targeting its underlying social, economic and cultural causes. Economic interactions can bring about lasting security and transform the region into a haven of peace and development.
After the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran stands ready to show that the practical path to security and stability is through the development that comes with economic engagement. With all of its economic and cultural potential, Iran is well-positioned to become a hub for export-oriented investment. Iran is also eager to show that we can all choose a lasting peace based on development and shared interests, which will lead to sustainable security rather than a volatile peace based on threats.
We hope to engage with our neighbours in a wide range of social and economic initiatives aimed at cooperation, which will enable the achievement of political understanding and even foster structural cooperation on security. In the international system today, mutual economic ties are considered to be the foremost factors in facilitating political cooperation and reducing security-related challenges.
In 2013, from this very stage, I called for combating violence and extremism (A/68/PV.6, p. 13). Subsequently, the representatives of the international community unanimously gave my appeal their seal of endorsement and, as a 
result, the General Assembly adopted resolution 68/127, on a world against violent extremism. The implementation of that resolution requires well-intentioned solutions and the application of experience gained in the realm of diplomacy. I am pleased that, by adding the support for the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action to the invaluable support for the world against violent extremism resolution, we may now devise a plan to resolve the problems of a shattered Middle East caught in the claws of brutality and savagery.
With a view to fighting ignorance, dictatorship, poverty, corruption, terrorism, violence and their social, political, cultural, economic and security impacts, I would like to invite the entire world, in particular the countries of my region, to form a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action campaign aimed at creating a united front against extremism and violence. Such a front must create a collective and global movement to tackle regional problems in a serious manner through dialogue, prevent the slaughter of innocent people and the bombardment of civilians, counter the promotion of violence and the killing of other human beings, provide for stability in cooperation with established central Governments to maintain stability, and once stability is established, build diplomacy and democratic governance in the Middle East region.
Iraq, Syria and Yemen are all examples of crises that are being stoked through terror, extremism, violence, bloodshed, invasion and the indifference of the international community. They are also examples of how the flight from the horrors of war and bombardment triggers displacement and homelessness. The problems of those countries have persisted because the international community has failed them and because of the wrong-minded actions of newcomers to the region and naive transregional actors. As a result, the wave of destruction has gone beyond the Arab world and reached the doorstep of Europe and the United States, resulting in the loss of priceless elements of the world heritage, including precious relics of ancient civilizations. It has also resulted, more broadly, in the death of humanity itself.
We must not forget that the roots of today’s wars, destruction and terror can be found in yesterday’s occupations, invasions and military interventions. If the United States military invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq had not taken place and if the United States had not provided unwarranted support for the inhumane actions of the Zionist regime against the oppressed nation of Palestine, the terrorists today would not have any justification for their crimes. It is high time that the Government of the United States stop claiming to know the truth about our region and cease throwing baseless accusations about against its adversaries while
pursuing dangerous policies on behalf of its regional allies. Its behaviour, which only cultivates the seeds of division and extremism, must be brought to an end, and its actions must be made compatible with the realities of the region.
Despite the many problems in our region today, we believe in a promising future. We do not doubt that the obstacles can be overcome by wisdom, prudence and the use of new and powerful capacities, as well as by relying on our civilizational roots and our serious resolve. Thanks to the light of divine revelation, we have faith in the bright future of humankind, in which people will live in peace, tranquillity and spirituality. We believe in the will of nations to choose the path of goodness and purity. We believe that ultimate victory will be won by those with good-natured piety."
70,2015,MDG,"My first words are directed to the new President of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, to whom I extend sincere congratulations on his election to that post during this session.
I also thank the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership and tenacity in ensuring that our Organization remains the most appropriate and legitimate forum for solving the problems of the world.
For our part, we can attest to the active support of the United Nations during the election process in Madagascar. Moreover, since January, the United Nations has continued to support Madagascar through the Peacebuilding Fund.
The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations is a historic one, as it coincides with the adoption of the new post-2015 development agenda in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), thereby auguring an ambitious and promising future for our peoples. From the perspective of its 70 years, the United Nations remains a forum to whose long journey the world can bear witness. It has overcome numerous challenges, has both strengths and weaknesses, yet it has always remained clear-sighted and committed to peace and security, and, above all, to the service of humankind.
Let us take objectively assess its work over the past 70 years. To be fair, we should assess them objectively. During the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), poverty has been our main enemy. Yet today it is clear that poverty remains and inequality persists. Our goal of eradicating extreme poverty has not been fully met,
6/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
although there has been significant progress. The MDGs have largely contributed to growth in many countries and have encouraged each country to redouble its efforts to adopt practical strategies to help avert difficulties. Today, the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aspire to that same vision. The Assembly has thereby shown a new commitment in line with the requirements of our ever- changing world, to which we must constantly adapt our strategies.
The new post-2015 development Agenda will fuel our future actions aimed at creating noticeable and lasting impacts for the benefit of humankind. We do not have the right to fail to meet the expectations of our peoples. We must ensure the well-being and the daily lives of our peoples, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations because today, extreme poverty still prevails in many countries of the world, and threats to global security also deserve our urgent attention. Terrorism, climate change and the recurring problems associated with poverty are factors pushing populations to flee in the hope of a better future or simply a life of dignity. By adopting the new post-2015 development Agenda, we are offering Governments a solution for development that enables them to act effectively. Since its independence, Madagascar has consistently promoted the same values as those of the United Nations and has taken the same path as the Organization in adopting policies and universal strategies.
In adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals, the world has just set the foundation for a new framework for its development. Commitments have been made to leave future generations a better world, given our current natural resources and the fact that they are not unlimited. With that common aim, Madagascar would like to renew its commitment to implementing the new post- 2015 development Agenda, which will serve as a frame of reference and aid in the realization of our national development plan.
The global threat of climate change deserves our unwavering attention. We all have an obligation to achieve results, faced with that global scourge. The coming twenty- first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December, will provide the ideal framework for showing our solidarity in that fight. While t developing countries are not the main parties responsible for the causes of climate change, they pay a heavy price for it, especially because they lack the resources needed to confront those challenges. Madagascar routinely suffers
from the consequences of climate change, which have led to agricultural losses and the destruction of basic social infrastructures and have often set back efforts to achieve socioeconomic development.
On 24 September, we submitted our national proposal with a commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 14 per cent and to increasing absorption capacity to 32 per cent by 2030. With a view to protecting biodiversity — and Madagascar holds a significant portion of that world heritage — we recently supported resolution 69/314, entitled “Tackling illicit trafficking in wildlife”. In addition, with regard to disaster-risk reduction, we have been fully involved in the implementation of resolution 69/283, on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, adopted in June 2015, which was designed to reduce disaster risks. The Malagasy Government focuses particular attention on its population, especially the most vulnerable. Its visionary social protection policy will enable it to significantly reduce the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2030, in line with the new post-2015 development agenda.
The country is also involved in the implementation of the Secretary-General’s plan on the reduction of maternal mortality. We have launched a campaign to speed up the reduction of maternal mortality and another against early marriage. In regard to food security, I would like to share our promising regional prospect to make Madagascar the breadbasket of the Indian Ocean. Such fundamental transformations must be based on support for the civil sector. Our men, women, youth and children must have access to education, basic health care, security and justice. We have a young population, which commits us to meeting the challenge of education as well as training and job creation. It is our joint responsibility to offer our young people decent work.
A new era is opening before us. New hope is being built with the advent of the new Sustainable Development Goals. By meeting in this Hall today, each nation is providing proof of its commitment to make progress on those Goals. The SDGs must not simply be a reference point and ready guide in the fight against poverty. All our actions must be capitalized on, brought together for sustainable human development, because there is no world apart from that of humankind. All our efforts should be focused on capitalizing on sustainable development, because human beings are our richest resource. Human capital is both the stakeholder for and beneficiary of the SDGs. The development of human capital must be at the heart of all of our actions. Our peoples’ security, in all its
15-29658 7/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
forms, must be ensured so that we can move away from extreme poverty and vulnerability, which are becoming chronic.
We are convinced that wars, crises, conflicts and insecurity are the root causes of systematic violations of human rights. In that light, peace and security remain the Achilles heel of all development strategies. It is through that shared vision that Madagascar is pursuing its path towards democracy and stability. We all agree that there is no real development without lasting peace and security.
Cybercrime, transnational organized crime and terrorism have become more pressing issues. We are fighting faceless enemies, and we must constantly adapt our strategies against those new threats. The security of our peoples must therefore be ensured in order to remove them from poverty and vulnerability. We are engaged in many forms of combat against urban and rural insecurity and are fighting against all kinds of trafficking and looting, which impacts our natural resources on land and at sea. On that issue, our country will be the location for the Maritime Information Fusion Centre, serving the Indian Ocean and East and Southern Africa with a view to assisting in combating maritime piracy, all types of illicit trafficking and terrorism.
With regard to the democratic process of carrying out elections, Madagascar is in a good position to provide a favourable environment for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. Without institutional and political stability, the progress we envisage and to which the population aspires will not be lasting and shared.
In the area of collective security, I would like to pay tribute to the commitment of peacekeeping mission personnel. Madagascar actively participates by sending peacekeeping officers. From this podium, we declare our intention to deploy, for the first time, an infantry battalion to peacekeeping operations by 2017.
On the topic of the fight against human trafficking, Madagascar has ratified the main relevant international legal instruments on human rights, and it recently ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (resolution 45/158). As some in this Hall know, Madagascar has also sought to meet its international commitments by regularly submitting its reports on human rights to the various human rights treaty bodies and to the Human Rights Council in the framework of the Universal Periodic Review, whose recommendations are implemented through a national operational plan.
This year, Madagascar deposited its instrument of ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. During a meeting in New York earlier in 2015, in keeping with its international commitments, Madagascar reaffirmed its commitment to promote women’s rights and renewed its previous commitment made in Beijing. We are joining our efforts with those of others in seeking to make the representation of countries on the Security Council more equitable. It is only fair that that opportunity be offered to under-represented regions such as Africa.
The General Assembly remains the body most suited to the task of overcoming the major challenges associated with the eradication of poverty and the disruptive effects of climate change. The issues of migration, peace and security are no less important. The resolution of those complex problems constitutes a top priority among the SDGs and Africa’s Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want.
Given the momentum created by the newly adopted 2030 Agenda, Madagascar foresees that the next 15 years will be rich in collective action and solidarity. In accordance with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, our country is committed to mobilizing its own resources and urges our international partners to do the same. Accordingly, we call upon the United Nations to propose the appropriate financing mechanisms and structures to support economic and social development policies and to combat poverty in developing countries.
Official development assistance is necessary and important to support growth. The Northern countries’ solidarity with those of the South must be effective. We must support one another complementarily, because it is together that we will succeed and be able to act and react in real time to the major challenges that are facing us. Our will and determination will guide us in quickening our stride to meet those challenges. I therefore unhesitatingly reiterate my call for the enhancement of the North-South dialogue and the strengthening of global partnerships. In order to truly support development, the terms of funding must not in any way penalize those countries and peoples that are already vulnerable.
Can we have confidence in the future? Can our young people have confidence in the future? On this solemn occasion, I urge my peers not to lose sight of the commitment that we made 70 years ago, which
8/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
has been reflected in the solid decisions that we have taken throughout the years and not delay in taking action. The SDGs enable us to facilitate prevention and the maintenance of peace, security and stability. The new Agenda outlines new strategic directions that will guide us in forging the destiny of our peoples.
Madagascar maintains its hope and faith in the United Nations for the next 70 years. A good portion of the path has already been trodden, but the road remains long. We must not be concerned about counting steps. The challenges are immense, but never, since time immemorial, have so many countries and leaders demonstrated their will and commitment to move ahead so as to overcome and solve the problems of today’s world. We must demonstrate that we are moving closer to a millennium of solidarity that transcends borders. That requires the commitment and responsibility of each country and each leader.
This month we began laying down the foundations of a new edifice. Its completion depends only on us. Rest assured that Madagascar will contribute to that endeavour.
"
70,2015,TUV,"On behalf of the Government and the people of Tuvalu, it is indeed a great honour and pleasure to deliver this statement at the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I congratulate the President on his election and wish the Assembly success and blessings under his able guidance and leadership. May the Good Lord bless and sustain him and our United Nations.
I also wish to thank the former President of the General Assembly, Mr. Sam Kutesa, for delivering the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and the many other core successes of 2015 in our transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era to that of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We applaud all the Chairs of the major United Nations conferences and summits — on disaster risk reduction in Sendai, on financing for development in Addis Ababa and last week’s Summit for the adoption of the Agenda. We thank the entire membership and members of non-governmental organizations, civil society, the private sector and academia, who all contributed to the dialogues, negotiations and drafting responsibilities. Let me also pay tribute to Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon and his managers, the Secretariat and all the specialized United Nations agencies, staff and peacekeepers, who are honouring the citizens of
20/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
the world with the best of their service, energy and commitment.
It has been 70 years of successful life for this sacred institution, and we have also exhausted the 15 years of the MDGs. How we have fared is a key beacon of the relevance and effectiveness of multilateralism and this solemn union, the United Nations. The noble visions and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations remain pertinent and vital for successive generations that long for peace, security and prosperity. The MDGs saved millions from hunger and poverty. We are more technologically advanced, more connected, more cooperative and more aware of the global issues — and certainly have resisted the temptation of an all-out world war.
Yet we must be honest with ourselves and note that there are persisting inequities, recurring insecurities and planetary distress that require our urgent attention. A significant number of “we the people” globally are still homeless, jobless, with many more are becoming displaced and stateless. Many are deprived of opportunities for education and health services, and many still have a hopeless future, and as such, extremism has become an alternative choice of existence for those disoriented, if not lost, souls.
In short, there are still many left behind. As we are fully aware, it is usually the aged, women, youth, the disabled and little children who are deprived and robbed of their fundamental rights to be human in such dire situations. We must have a United Nations answer. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its 17 Goals and 169 targets, must deliver for the people. Every child, every woman, every citizen, every community should know the Sustainable Development Goals and own the rights under these Goals. The Goals must be advocated as widely as possible to all global citizens through the technological advances that we have for information and communication so that they can be understood, owned and adhered to by one and all. The Goals must bring about accountability on the part of our leaders, our development partners, the private sector, religious bodies and the youthful generation.
We must aspire to deliver tangible outcomes in all countries and to be all-inclusive in participation, design, decision-making and implementation and in the gains derived from them. Each country must take the reins and drive its own pursuits befitting their own circumstances and capabilities. The United Nations
and our universal goals are only as effective as the sum of all our positive national and regional actions put together. What we do for our own people is what makes the difference. The success of the United Nations is ours to create.
As a least developed country and one of the smallest small island developing States (SIDS), Tuvalu is fully aware of its responsibilities under Agenda 2030, as it was also with the MDGs. We are planning to host a national summit to help develop our next development plan in November. Our national priorities, along with our framework for pacific regionalism, will be aligned to the interregional agenda of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway and mainstreamed into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Our small islands face multiple structural constraints and vulnerabilities. Sea-level rise continues to inundate many of our small island coastlines and inundate our food plantations. That is a security issue, an urgent and intergenerational one. It is an existential issue for Tuvalu and other Pacific countries, and also bigger populated countries in the flood plains, and will displace many people. While many of our citizens are opting to migrate on their own terms because of existential issues, migration does not solve global warming, and the United Nations does not identify climate change migrants as refugees. That is a dilemma for us in Tuvalu.
The 2030 Agenda will be meaningless to many of us low-lying SIDS if a credible climate change agreement in Paris in December is not ambitious and action-oriented. The Paris agreement therefore must reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep the global average temperature rise to below 1.5° Celsius; recognize that climate change is a human right issue for Tuvaluans and many other millions and is an urgent security and existential issue; be committed to a low- carbon future; include a loss and damage architecture to recognize that preventing climate change is a national obligation for those who pollute, and the polluters must reduce emissions or pay to clean, mitigate and aid those most vulnerable and without the means to adapt; provide credible, timely public finance and clarity from developed countries to the pledges of $100 billion for climate change finances; and it must be reassuring for the private sector to transition and invest in clear energy and climate-resilient approaches.
15-29822 21/29

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
Tuvalu will submit its intended nationally determined contributions. We must all note that our obligation is not only to submit those contributions, but also to ensure that we achieve those set targets. There must be no backsliding. We must have a good review mechanism to gauge whether cumulatively we are reducing emissions and not increasing them.
The increasing unease from destabilizing conflicts, violence, malicious brutality and related impunity throughout the globe is worrisome. We have to provide hope and leadership to find lasting peace. We welcome the report of the Secretary-General on the future of the United Nations peace operations (see A/70/95), which calls for change and reform, and the Secretary-General’s plan of action to promote tolerance and reconciliation and counter violent extremism.
Tuvalu also welcomes the adoption by consensus of a text to advance the negotiation of reforms to the Security Council. The adopted resolution is long overdue giving much needed impetus to the recycling of known positions and statements repeated in the foregoing 23 years. We must advance with a Security Council that is more representative of a membership and a world with more nuanced and ominous security- related issues.
Recent global social and economic tensions and market jitters remind us that we are of course not immune to a repeat of the global financial crisis. The cost and prolonged painful recovery, even in the far remote small economies like Tuvalu, are still vivid in our memories. The new SDGs framework must ensure that accountability measures are elaborated and enforced, especially for the rich echelons that are untouchable and ignorant of the far-reaching repercussions of their greed, especially to small genuine investors.
As custodians of the Pacific Ocean, Tuvalu fully supports SDG 14. We are all oceanic States as our planet and Mother Earth is more than 70 per cent blue. The blue ocean is not a sink for radioactive spillovers of nuclear wastes. It is not a dump for industrial and general garbage. It is not a carpet to sweep and hide our dirt under. We from the islands have a warning for our SDGs. Without a healthy ocean it would be a challenge to achieve many other sustainable goals. Do not give a man a fish to satisfy his hunger just for a day, give a whole generation a healthy ocean and all succeeding generations will be satisfied for eternity.
The successful implementation and outreach of the Secretary-General’s sustainable energy for all will be a vital undertaking of the 2030 Agenda. Clean energy undergirds and empowers most other SDGs. We must cooperate in a shared quest for a smooth transition from fossil fuel to renewable alternatives and to ensuring that energy security, accessibility and affordability is applied holistically.
We look forward to the smooth transfer of technology and technical skills, the development of the technology bank and data and capacity-building that is tailored to each country’s unique situation and context. We would appreciate the facilitation of the means of implementation and finance as discussed in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
For vulnerable LDCs and SIDS, the timely operationalization and mobilization of the Green Climate Fund, with minimal bureaucracy, will be most welcome. But as much as we need capacity enhancement, science, data and new technology, we must match this with leadership integrity. The recent papal encyclical of His Holiness Pope Francis agrees that our leadership roles must be free of political wrangling, power squabbling, conflicts, trade imbalances, bad governance, race and gender differentiation, self-interests, greed and profit- only mentality and ignorance of nature’s deterioration.
We the people need SDGs championed by good accountable leaders. In Tuvalu we have conducted leadership seminars for our parliamentarians and approved a leadership code for all in leadership positions nationwide. The independent Office of the Ombudsman is now fully engaged in its responsibilities.
Monitoring and reviewing our progress on the SDGs throughout the next 15 years is vital to sustain and focus our transformative agenda per country. The role of the High-level Political Forum will therefore be critical to respond to the changing and evolving circumstances of each member and region, ensuring that Agenda 2030 is adding value, effective and fit for purpose.
The graduation criteria for least developed countries and their application require proper scrutiny and review, as they are biased towards statistical calculations rather than SIDS vulnerable realities. Tuvalu will forever be a small island developing State, with constrained options for productivity, trade and economies of scale. In fact, we are losing land because of sea-level rise. Our economic and social and environmental vulnerabilities
22/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
are intrinsically interlocked. They cannot be perused analytically in silos when computing graduation criteria.
Early in March, Tropical Cyclone Pam devastated Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Kiribati and Solomon Islands. Given Tuvalu’s low elevation and small size, the devastation was significant, further confirming our high vulnerability to the increasing occurrences and severity of natural disasters. A high-level dialogue on Tropical Cyclone Pam was held with our development partners last July in Funafuti to seek assistance for an Australian $92 million bill for the recovery efforts. We have also submitted a comprehensive project to the Green Climate Fund to better safeguard and protect our people, land and infrastructure in the long term when such disasters revisit in future.
We applaud the thawing of tensions between close neighbours the United States of America and Cuba. We sincerely hope that the embargo against Cuba will be lifted soon, and for continued dialogue, smooth transition and a resumption of economic partnerships in the near future. We thank the Government of Cuba for offering scholarships to many SIDS and developing countries in the health sector, despite their economic restraints because of the embargo. This year eight Tuvaluan medical doctors graduated from Cuba. That spirit of cooperation gives the Charter of the United Nations Charter real meaning and value.
Tuvalu also welcomes the efforts of the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan in fostering peace and prosperity in the region and globally. The Government and non-governmental organizations of Taiwan have consistently supported various developmental and humanitarian undertakings directly and through many specialized United Nations bodies, such as the World Health Assembly, the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Taiwan’s infrastructure projects, technology transfer and capacity-building have produced genuine and tangible outcomes in Tuvalu. We can achieve the ambitious goals we have set ourselves in Agenda 2030 only if all the permutations of partnerships are utilized and honoured.
Finally, Tuvalu pledges its full support for the new Agenda “Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” and for the General Assembly at its seventieth session, under the theme of
the general debate, that is, “The United Nations at 70: a new commitment to action”. Let us work together to create a future that is accommodating to the total human race, and to heal and secure our planet for successive generations. If we are ambitious in all our 17 SDGs, let us not be any less ambitious with Goal 13 in Paris.
"
70,2015,SYR,"I would like to congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the seventieth session and to wish him success in leading the work of this session. I would also like to thank his predecessor for his presidency at the previous session.
I greet the Assembly of this great international Organization, which was originally established, with all its agencies, in order for peace and security to prevail in the world. I come from a country where security has been disrupted and peace has been disturbed — a country that has been experiencing a brutal war for more than four years. I greet the Assembly from a land baptized by the blood of its people, who are fighting terrorism and defending their fellow citizens against terrorism, while waiting for the United Nations to fulfil its promises and implement its resolutions aimed at combating terrorism.
The resolutions adopted by the Security Council under Chapter VII are still just ink on paper, mentioned only in press releases and media statements, while on the ground the countries funding, sponsoring and supporting terrorism are still fuelling extremism in the region, still arming and training terrorists and sending them to Syria and are indifferent to and unconcerned about the implementation of those resolutions.
I ask the Assembly, on behalf of the Syrians who are resisting this scourge, how long will the powerful Member States continue to intimidate other Member States committed to international law and to ignore States that disregard Security Council resolutions? What has the international community done to stop those States from committing criminal acts against the Syrian people? Why is there all this silence? The international community watched as this extremist ideology spread until it reached Europe and struck there as it is striking the Middle East now. It watched while sleeper cells were awakened and bombings and assassinations re-emerged in the West. The people of those countries are not guilty, yet they are beginning to pay the price for some of their politicians’ support of terrorism.
Everyone here knows better than most that terrorism is an ideology that recognizes no boundaries, and that when this monster is on the move, it is not limited to
15-29816 21/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
particular countries. The terrorism of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and of the Al-Nusra Front and other Al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist organizations is killing the innocent, capturing women and bombarding civilians with mortar shells. This terrorism is cutting off drinking water and destroying historic and cultural landmarks, including those on the World Heritage List, which form part of the heritage of all humankind. The most recent of such crimes was the destruction of the temples of Baal Shamin and Bel and the brutal killing of archaeologists.
Why do some countries support other countries that are accustomed to exporting their crises beyond their borders? Why do they support them while knowing that they only cause destruction? How can developed countries that hold elections and have parliaments align themselves with countries that do not have parliaments and do not recognize the rights of women, who represent half of society? How can the former accept such practices as sexual jihad, slaughter, cutting off hands and the systematic destruction of history, monuments and culture?
In the light of that situation, I affirm that Syria will continue to fight terrorism in word and deed. The Syrian armed forces are capable of cleansing the country of terrorists, despite the sacrifices involved and the high prices they have already paid and are continuing to pay. Syrian people from all backgrounds have also paid with their lives and in every other way in terms of security, the economy and their livelihood.
Now is the time for honesty and truth. It is the duty of the international community to stop the flow to Syria of terrorists, who, according to United Nations data, are coming from 100 countries to create a caliphate State. That State, as members all know, will not be limited to Syria or Iraq. Those who wish to lead such a caliphate have frequently stated that their goal is a State that stretches from Mecca throughout Europe, a State that, according to them, will restore the glory of the caliphate. If the international community does not stop States from supporting terrorism and sending terrorists, the fire that has broken out in Syria, Iraq and Libya will continue to spread.
Syria has not stopped advocating political dialogue and practising what it preaches. Its earlier vision — that the fight against terrorism must take priority if progress is to be made on other tracks — has proved to be correct. The Government cannot implement any democratic political measures related to elections, a
constitution or the like while terrorism is striking at home and threatening innocent civilians in the country. How can it ask the Syrian people to head to the ballot boxes when they are not safe either in the streets or in their homes because of the missiles and mortar shells launched against them by terrorist groups supported by countries whose identities are well known?
Nevertheless, we were, and still are, believers in political dialogue within the parameters known to all, namely, the preservation of national sovereignty, the unity of Syria’s territory and people, and the maintenance of State institutions, which may, nonetheless, be developed and improved. Moreover, there has to be an understanding that the only way to achieve a political solution is through a Syrian-led national dialogue without any foreign interference. On the basis of those conditions, Syria agreed to participate in a second Geneva conference on Syria and the first and second round of talks on Syria held in Moscow.
In this regard, I would like to announce that Syria agrees to participate in the four brainstorming committees of experts proposed by the Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura. Mr. De Mistura has repeatedly confirmed that the role of these committees is mainly to exchange ideas and that they will conduct non-binding preliminary consultations whose agreed outputs can be used to prepare for the launching of the third Geneva conference on Syria.
Some imagine that Syria’s acceptance of the political track — regardless of the form it takes, the initiative it is based on and the name it is given — stems from what they term the weakness of Syria’s army and people on the ground. To them I say that Syria is strong and continues to fight terrorism, and that the Syrian army and the Syrian people are united in the face of terrorism. Let no one think that, after all Syria’s sacrifices and steadfastness over more than four years, its adversaries can obtain through political means what they could not win militarily or that they will achieve at the negotiating table what they failed to achieve on the ground. The decision of the Syrian people lies in the hands of the Syrian people alone, and no one can deny them that right. I repeat: the decision of the Syrian people lies in their hands alone and no one can strip them of that right. The Syrian armed forces have astonished the world with their power, faith and persistence.
The important invitation of His Excellency President Vladimir Putin aimed at establishing an international/ regional coalition to counter terrorism received the
22/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
attention and support of the Syrian Government. Terrorism cannot be fought only from the air, and all the previous operations to combat it have merely led to its spread and to further outbreaks. Air strikes are useless unless they are conducted in cooperation with the Syrian armed forces, which currently are alone in combating terrorism in Syria. Russian air strikes in Syria, which were launched at the request of and in coordination with the Syrian Government, are effectively supporting the Syrian efforts to combat terrorism.
The so-called Arab Spring was a spring only for Israel and its covert and known allies. Israel continues to attack Syria while the world watches. Israel is arming the terrorists and treating them in its hospitals. It is helping them with its intelligence services and supporting them, so that they will stand between it and the Syrian armed forces across the border. While those terrorists are being weakened, it is intervening directly through air strikes and artillery shelling, just as Turkey did and is still doing, whether in Aleppo or Idlib, and just as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which are eager to shed Syrian blood by various means, are doing.
The continued support for terrorists and the escalation of their attacks on citizens in most regions and cities of Syria have led to shortages of basic commodities and services in many areas. The inhuman sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States of America have exacerbated the hardships of Syrian civilians.
My Government is cooperating with the United Nations and its humanitarian agencies within the framework of response plans, agreed with the Syrian Government, to meet the basic needs of our citizens, especially those forced by terrorist activities to flee their homes, many of whom have gone to neighbouring countries. Some of those countries have accommodated them in camps for weapons training or in places that resemble detention and isolation facilities. I stress that the Syrian Government guarantees a safe return and a decent life for all citizens who are willing to return. At the same time, Syria continues to make every effort to deliver aid from international organizations to all Syrian citizens, without discrimination, wherever they may be.
The Syrian Arab Republic reiterates its support for the full restoration of the occupied Syrian Golan to the line of 4 June 1967. It also emphasizes its rejection of all actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, to alter the geographic or demographic characteristics of
the occupied Syrian Golan, in clear violation of relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular resolutions 497 (1981) and 465 (1980). Furthermore, Syria confirms that the issue of Palestine is of central concern to the Syrian people, who support the inalienable and legitimate rights of the brotherly Palestinian people, in particular the right of return, the right to self- determination and the right to the establishment of an independent State on their own land, with Jerusalem as its capital.
At the end of 2013, Syria, acting on a proposal made by the President of the Russian Federation, His Excellency Mr. Vladimir Putin, acceded to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, with the aim of establishing in the Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction. It also wanted to demonstrate to the whole world its opposition to any use of chemical weapons. Syria fulfilled the obligations that resulted from its accession to the Convention and completed its commitments despite the prevailing difficult situation. Thanks to Syria’s cooperation, the Joint Mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations was able to complete its task.
The Syrian Arab Republic would like to commend the Islamic Republic of Iran for its steadfastness in achieving the historic agreement that fulfils the aspirations of the brotherly people of Iran. The agreement recognizes Iran’s right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and lifts the sanctions imposed against Iran and the freeze on its assets. It also opens up international relations for that brotherly country. The agreement proves that a diligent and serious diplomatic approach can be successful in overcoming all obstacles and can lead to a peaceful and just solution to a difficult issue.
Syria stresses that establishing a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East is unachievable unless Israel, the only nuclear Power in the region, accedes to all the treaties banning such weapons. Furthermore, with respect to its nuclear facilities, Israel should conclude a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. At the same time, Syria emphasizes the right of all countries to acquire and develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.

The imposition of unethical, unilateral and coercive measures by the United States and the European Union contradicts the rules of international law and the principles of free trade. On that basis, we congratulate Cuba on reaching an agreement with the United States that lifts the blockade imposed on it. It remains for all unilateral, coercive measures imposed on Syria and on the people of other countries, such as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Belarus, to be lifted.
Finally, all those who claim to care about the security and safety of the Syrian people should know that if we are to achieve victory over terrorism and accomplish economic and political reforms, it is essential that the counter-terrorism resolutions of the Security Council be fully and honestly implemented. Only then can we begin the countdown to the end of war in Syria. Only then will we arrive at the final moments and can prepare to implement what has been agreed through political dialogue.
"
70,2015,LTU,"The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations offers us an opportunity to renew our commitments to the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Today, those ideals and principles are threatened in so many ways around the globe. We are witnessing the largest displacement of people since the Second World War. As of last year, nearly 60 million people were displaced by war, conflict or persecution. Violent extremism is on the rise, with terrorist groups demonstrating new levels of brutality and barbarity. In the twenty-first century, women and girls are sold in slave markets by the criminals of Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) and abused in unspeakable ways. We have entered an era where the most primitive and brutal executions coexist with the most sophisticated information warfare, hybrid warfare and cyberwarfare.
The Charter of the United Nations has been breached in the middle of Europe, with no consequences. Last year, Russia annexed Crimea, and the Kremlin seeks to rewrite history and redraw the borders of post-war Europe. Even in the context of the multiple crises and security challenges the world is facing today,
the annexation of Crimea and military aggression in eastern Ukraine stand out because of their implications for the future of international peace and security. These acts strike at the very core of international law and at universally accepted norms of behaviour that have allowed the world community to survive without world wars for seven decades.
We cannot pledge respect for the Charter of the United Nations and ignore its breaches at the same time. Our collective failure to stand up for the underlying principles of the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine will have far-reaching negative repercussions for international order. The occupied territories of Ukraine, Georgia or Moldova are full of red lines that we ourselves have drawn but never acted upon. Again, we are reminded that if one closes one’s eyes to crimes, they do not disappear. They spread, grow and finally they take over. That is why it is our duty to uphold international humanitarian and human rights laws and to seek accountability when these laws are violated. Vetoing a Security Council resolution to commemorate the Srebrenica massacre or to set up a tribunal for the downing of Flight MH-17 is unjustifiable and is an insult to the memory of the victims. It also raises questions about the relevance, in the twenty-first century, of the Security Council as it is today.
For the Council to maintain its credibility, the least it can do is put an end to the use of the veto in cases of genocide, atrocity crimes, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Where would we be today had the Council been able to secure proper humanitarian access in Syria, had it taken measures to stop the use of barrel bombs and ensure accountability for gross human rights violations and abuses? The Security Council failed to do so, and millions of Syrians had to flee. By protecting the criminals, the four vetoes of resolutions pertaining to Syria did nothing to resolve the situation.
As a result, today we have the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. It is a global crisis that requires a global response. Unless we address the causes that make people flee their homes — such as lawlessness, repression and grave human rights abuses, corruption and poor governance, massive inequalities and marginalization — these flows of refugees will not stop. Conflicts will continue. Lawlessness breeds the worst of the worst — extremism, radicals and terrorists. We simply cannot afford for this to happen.

We live in an era when challenges and threats are enhanced by new ones. At 70, the United Nations must adapt to the realities of the twenty-first century and have the tools necessary to operate. The United Nations must do much better, tackling the underlying causes of the problems and conflicts at hand, and not merely the symptoms. It must be equipped and staffed to operate in environments of asymmetric and hybrid warfare, information wars and the growing threat of terrorism. It must also do a lot better at prevention and mediation, in order to save lives, as well as resources.
In the twenty-first century the world will need a strong United Nations that has been renewed in every sphere. Either we act now and shape globalization through cooperation and partnership, or the crises and conflicts of the globalized world will force us to respond at a much greater cost to all of us. The United Nations will cease to exist if people stop believing in it. Through our activities, 70 years after the founding of the United Nations, we must show that we continue to believe firmly in this Organization, which we all share.
"
70,2015,URY,"I bring to this forum, the largest and most representative of today’s world, the greetings of the people and the Government of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay — a greeting that expresses our passion for peace and freedom; our commitment to democracy, human rights, justice and solidarity; our commitment to the sustainable development of our country; and our desire for a humankind that, despite the redundancy, places at its core human beings — all human beings, men and women of this world without exception or excuse. We are all equal before the law, but above all we are all equal before life.
Although I come from Uruguay, I am not here to talk about the problems of Uruguay. I would modestly like to discuss problems affecting humankind as a whole. Weeks ago the world public opinion was moved by the image of a dead child on a beach after the sinking of the vessel with which, like so many other victims of the conflict in their country, he was trying to find a place in the world where he could find the protection to which he was entitled. The international reaction was immediate, but we hope that it was not ephemeral, that we not forget this tragedy that hit us and shamed us, to act with determination and efficiency in finding
solutions to the global tragedy of the exodus of millions of human beings.
Uruguay, as a nation nurtured by immigration and as a people that received international solidarity when it needed it, accepts this unavoidable duty. It is imperative to avoid a repetition of this tragedy, but it is also necessary to address the causes that brought it about. Always, and not just in matters of health, prevention is better than cure. Prevention means recognizing others as the same as us, which is much more than “tolerating” them”, respecting and promoting their rights, all their rights; betting on democracy as a form of government and state of society; educating and training for dignified life, decent work and full citizenship; respecting the planet on which we live, which, moreover, is still the only one on which the human species can survive as such. If we continue to destroy this world in the short term, humankind and future generations are sure to be homeless.
Prevention also means rejecting all forms of terrorism and discrimination so that there are no dead children on the beaches of the world because they cannot find a place to live, rejecting terrorism and discrimination wherever they arise and in all circumstances and places. Prevention is thinking boldly and acting sensibly with an eye on future generations, but as there is no future without a present, prevention is also thinking and acting according to our hopes, needs and possibilities.
A moment ago, I made a reference to health, no doubt because of my work experience — since I am a physician and until very recently was in the full exercise of my profession and vocation — but not only from experience. As the leader of my country, I am well aware that public health is a key and essential component of the sovereignty of nations, a right of individuals, a factor in the development of societies and an unavoidable responsibility of States.
From that perspective, we face a disturbing and unavoidable reality at the level of the whole of planet Earth. Indeed, according to recent studies and reports of the World Health Organization, first, the global burden of disease is shifting from acute, infectious diseases to chronic non-communicable diseases; the two must be fought, by working to keep acute diseases from appearing and by acting to prevent non-communicable chronic diseases from occurring. Secondly, chronic conditions such as heart disease and strokes are
15-29431 35/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
currently the leading cause of death worldwide. If we add other non-communicable diseases linked mainly to the lifestyle that we are developing as we advance, it is obvious that there is little left to say. Over 60 to 70 per cent of morbidity and mortality worldwide is due to chronic non-communicable diseases — cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and so on. Accordingly there is still so much to be done.
That task should have no borders of any kind, because the complex of problems underlying them know no borders. That is so much the case that the mere mention of the complex global landscape brings to mind Africa and Asia in particular, as well as Latin America, where many low-income and middle-income countries currently face a double burden of morbidity. Infectious diseases are killing people mercilessly and impacting us deeply, while chronic non-communicable diseases are also insidiously killing our populations.
At the same time, malnutrition and risk factors for chronic non-communicable diseases, such as overweight and obesity, have been said to also affect high-income countries and remain prevalent in the world. It is estimated that cancer has been costing Latin America $4.5 billion annually in terms of direct costs for physicians’ consultations, studies, diagnoses, treatment, medication, hospitalization, palliative care and more. There are indirect costs as well, such as travel and accommodations, lost work days and productivity. How much of that money could be saved if, rather than using it to treat the effects of these diseases, it could be put into social policies to improve people’s lives by offering better education, better health and dignified living conditions for our peoples?
It may be unpleasant to mention this aspect, but it is part of an uncomfortable reality that we must change, because if we do not adopt immediate measures by the year 2030, 1 million Latin Americans will die annually of cancer alone, and more than 7 million people globally will die from a preventable disease that, with early diagnosis and proper treatment, can be cured. Cancer will kill more people in the world every year than those killed during the Second World War. We are facing a brutal pandemic and, I humbly suggest, we must be aware of the reality we are currently suffering a pandemic that the humankind has never before known.
Life is precious; it has no price. In order to address and reverse the growing morbidity and mortality
from cancer and other non-communicable diseases, it is important to adopt political positions and policies and to implement systemic strategies to end poverty, generate social inclusion, promote education, encourage healthful lifestyles, and strengthen integrated health systems, including national programmes for the primary prevention, early detection and diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and long-term follow-up of these diseases. In regard to healthful lifestyles, physical activity and sports are important, as is a healthful diet, as opposed to the harmful and highly processed foods of an industry that growing exponentially.
We must control smoking, alcoholism and drug abuse. Based on our experience, we feel that it is indispensable to include tobacco and alcohol in our policies on drugs. We know it is not easy, but it is possible to regulate those markets without resorting to prohibitionist dogmatism and respecting the rights of individuals and making public health a matter of State sovereignty and social progress. Above all, I reiterate that the fight against smoking is also one against its vector of transmission, which is not mosquitoes, birds or rats but a multinational tobacco industry that, in order to double its profits, has no problem killing its own customers.
Uruguay has been a world leader in the implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Beginning in January 2014, Uruguay adopted a law on the control and regulation of cannabis, and we are working on measures related to controlling alcoholism, perhaps with a zero-tolerance policy in certain cases and circumstances. Finally, with regard to that issue, nothing can be achieved in isolation. Everything requires sensitivity, resolve and perseverance on the part of all Governments and peoples throughout the world.
In the area of international cooperation, we are not starting from zero. There are a number of institutional frameworks and modalities and very many projects under way. Could the implementation of the former and the progress of the latter be improved? No doubt, but rather than inventing new ones, let us make better use of what we already have. To that end, we certainly will need more human, material and financial resources, but there is one resource without which all these things, as abundant as they may be, will always be insufficient. I am referring to the resource of political will, which in this case is more than an ideological dilemma or a question of left, right or centre; it is an ethical issue.
36/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
It is not ethical that, in some circumstances, tribunals and multinational organizations are able to prioritize trade over the defence of the fundamental human right to health and life. That is what Uruguay is suffering from. A major international tobacco company — I would cite only its initials so as not to offend certain sensibilities, but it is in fact Philip Morris — has appealed against Uruguay for bringing the issue of tobacco control to the World Health Organization. That is the situation Uruguay faces. Perhaps because we are a small country, we have been chosen for that role, not just to punish Uruguay but so that other countries of the world do not follow the path Uruguay has taken to fight against tobacco and to provide a better quality of life to its people.
Calling for ethics in the twenty-first century, I realize, might appear to be naïve or anachronistic, but the reality indicates the opposite. As we stated, we need only look at the news of the past few weeks to see that in some aspects, none of them trivial, the world really seems to be a kind of lunatic asylum run by its own patients. That is terrible, but if humankind wants to survive and progress, it cannot resign itself to such a terrible situation. It cannot become resigned to war or to the humiliation of poor people who have nothing to eat, nor can we close our eyes 24 hours after seeing a Syrian boy dead on a Turkish beach.
From our own perspective as a Latin American country and as Latin Americans, we cannot fail to mention three situations that are prominent on the agenda of our region. The first is the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba as an indispensable step in the normalization of bilateral relations between the two countries. We commend that step, and while we are aware of the complexity of the process under way, we are confident with regard to its future, particularly with regard to the key element of ending the economic, trade and financial embargo imposed on Cuba more than 50 years ago by the Government of the United States. As it has done on previous occasions, Uruguay will vote in favour of the General Assembly’s draft resolution calling for an end to the embargo. Hopefully it will be the last time that the Assembly will have to pronounce on the issue.
The second situation in Latin America is the tension that has existed for several weeks on the border between Colombia and Venezuela. We call for calm, respectful and open dialogue between the Governments of these brother countries in order to deal with this
situation, whose main victims are the peoples of the two countries, especially their socially most vulnerable sectors.
The third situation is the peace talks in Colombia, another complex but decisive process for our brother country and our region as a whole. We support this process and are ready to cooperate with it under the terms agreed to and demanded by the parties. Uruguay is not omnipotent, nor does it claim to be omnipresent or infallible, but neither is it indifferent.
In 2008, our country officially submitted its candidacy for a seat on the Security Council as a non-permanent member for the period 2016 to 2017. We did so based on our commitment to this Organization, of which we are a founding member; on our adherence to international law and multilateralism; on our firm rejection of all forms of terrorism and discrimination; on our conviction that the only means capable of resolving conflicts are the peaceful ones laid down in the Charter of the United Nations; and on our confidence in the value of the Security Council’s efforts to fulfil its primary function of maintaining international peace and security.
Uruguay has contributed to peace and security with a concrete and unwavering commitment that began before the creation of the United Nations, has been maintained over the Organization’s 70-year history and today is manifest in its participation in the peacekeeping operations whose mandates come from that very Security Council. We want to bring our values, commitment and efforts to bear as a non-permanent member of the Council for the period 2016 to 2017. We rely on the support of those here to help us do that, and we will not disappoint them.
"
70,2015,TTO,"It is a signal honour for me to address this body and to extend to the President on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. We also express our appreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa of Uganda, for the many productive initiatives that he pursued to good effect during his tenure.
The President has assumed the mantle of leadership of this body at a critical juncture in the life of the Organization. Now is an opportune moment to reaffirm its founders’ guiding vision as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to rededicate ourselves to be faithful in our joint pursuit of the goals of peace, security, development and human rights.
But, as we assess the performance and impact of the United Nations, we must also look ahead to the next phase in the life of this unique Organization, given the many challenges that confront human civilization in general and the international community in particular. Consequently, Trinidad and Tobago considers the theme of this session — “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights” — to be both most fitting and timely.
A few days ago in this very Hall, Member States adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the overarching framework that will guide global development for the next 15 years. Trinidad and Tobago echoes the words of the Secretary-General that the 2030 Agenda encompasses a universal, transformative and integrated agenda that heralds a historic turning point for our world. The adoption of this landmark agreement is testament to the triumph, and indeed the power and possibilities, of multilateralism, especially as it emphasizes a people’s agenda, with the promise of leaving no one behind. This ambitious and inclusive Agenda must not be lost in lofty rhetoric.
15-29822 23/29

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
The United Nations has as its main purposes to maintain international peace and security, to promote and protect human rights and to effectively address pressing international economic and social issues, such as development, through international cooperation.
Although in the aftermath of the Second World War the United Nations has succeeded in preventing another global war, peace still remains elusive in some parts of the world. Conflicts and tensions adversely affect countries and regions well beyond their immediate place of origin, whether through forced migration, disruption of basic public services such as health, education and sanitation or through rendering impossible the normal conduct of business activity.
Trinidad and Tobago is a strong advocate for the reform of the Security Council to better enable that body to respond to the various security and other challenges that currently confront the international community. This is especially so having regard to the fact that, in the contemporary world, warfare is no longer the exclusive preserve of nation States. Other actors, with pernicious designs, have acquired the capability to threaten States and to carry out dastardly deeds calculated to intimidate, and continue to pose serious threats to international peace and security. The United Nations must therefore respond with alacrity to those threats in a manner that is acceptable to all Member States. That is achievable if the Security Council is reformed to genuinely reflect the diversity that today characterizes and embodies the United Nations.
For small States such as Trinidad and Tobago, the maintenance of international peace and security is of paramount importance. We are keenly aware that our prospects for achieving sustainable development are inextricably linked to the safety and security of our people. However, our ability to provide such safety and security is increasingly being stretched, given that Trinidad and Tobago is located in a region heavily impacted by the trafficking of small arms and light weapons, as well as its attendant ills.
This illicit trade is transboundary in nature and is largely associated with the drug trade and its international criminal networks. Consequently, Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean Community fully subscribe to the aims and objectives of the Arms Trade Treaty as a critical vehicle to address the scourge of the illicit arms trade. We do so because we understand all too well that the continued presence of this menace
in our region can, if left unchecked, undermine our peace and security and limit our progress towards sustainable development.
Trinidad and Tobago recognizes that as we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations, the international community still grapples with the goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Trinidad and Tobago and the other members of the Caribbean Community join with the countries of Latin America in celebrating our common commitment to denuclearization through the establishment of our region as the first nuclear-free zone in the world.
The disastrous humanitarian consequences of the use of the nuclear option today for a large number of people from diverse regions of the world could result in widespread suffering, dislocation of populations and increased migration, thus undermining the peace, security and development of many countries and regions. This reality should chasten all peoples, and especially the leaders of countries possessing such weapons.
Accordingly, we welcome the nuclear deal negotiated by the United States, its partners and the Islamic Republic of Iran. We wish to congratulate all the parties involved on the tenacity and patience they demonstrated in that complex and demanding process, and challenge both sides to honour their commitments.
The 2030 Agenda would not be fully implemented if the most vulnerable members of our societies — women, children, persons with disabilities and indigenous peoples — are not placed at the very centre of the development paradigm. Regrettably, in some parts of the world, women and children continue to be denied fundamental human rights and freedoms, receive less pay for equal work as men and are systematically prevented from obtaining an education, all of which hinder their ability to participate in the sustainable development of their countries.
Since its independence, in 1962, Trinidad and Tobago has enacted several laws and administrative and other measures to promote and strengthen the general well-being of women and girls in society. On the international plane, we have committed to the full and effective implementation of our obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
24/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
Additionally, recognizing the progressive contribution of women to peace and development, Trinidad and Tobago has since 2010 introduced, and been the main sponsor of, the General Assembly resolution on women, disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control since the year 2010.
Our commitment to the safety and security of our citizens remains undiminished, and as we move forward it is the intention of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to adopt a ‘whole of Government’ approach to national security, in which all ministries and national agencies will share responsibility and will be accountable for the safety of the State. To promote such an integrated and resilient approach to national security and to contribute to the attainment of sustainable development in line with the Government’s strategic vision for developed country status by 2030, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago will actively pursue mechanisms to strengthen national capacities to reduce risk and to build community resilience to threats to national security.
While time will not allow for a thorough review of our strategy, permit me to share some of the measures targeted for implementation: the development of an adaptable defence and security posture to ensure that the traditional role of the military is integrated with new roles to ensure the security of the State; the establishment of a joint border protection agency; the adoption of an intelligence-led national security architecture; and the enhancement of our disaster risk management capability policy.
The international community now accepts that climate change is a threat to our very existence. We need to be mindful, however, that this threat to humankind recognizes no boundaries, cannot be contained through high-level diplomatic talks and mediation and will weigh heavily upon developing countries, particularly small island developing States and least developed countries, thereby crippling their ability to react to external shocks to their social, economic and natural systems.
Like many other small island developing States, Trinidad and Tobago is at high risk of being severely affected by the devastating effects of climate change, and has therefore made mitigation measures a national priority, within the practical constraints of its limited financial capability. We recently witnessed the destructive effects of Tropical Storm Erika on our
fellow Caribbean State member, the Commonwealth of Dominica, which has set back that country’s development by many years.
It is undeniable, therefore, that climate change and development are closely interlinked. Recognizing the need for bold and responsible action on the part of all Governments, albeit on the basis of common but differentiated responsibility, Trinidad and Tobago has adopted a proactive posture and has submitted its intended nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ahead of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference. It is our expectation, in conformity with that of the Caribbean Community, that any credible agreement from the Paris Conference must set the world on a path to decarbonization of the global economy before the end of the century. In order to achieve that, the agreement must be legally binding and contain provisions on mitigation, adaptation, finance, transparency and compliance that would ensure that the increase in average global temperatures can be limited to less than l.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels. An ambitious agreement in Paris is therefore also an imperative for the maintenance of international peace and security in the medium to long term. Trinidad and Tobago is committed to work with all States to achieve a new legally binding balanced framework for global cooperation on climate change.
In the area of governance of the oceans, it is well established in international law that the utilization of resources of any kind beyond areas of national jurisdiction must be consistent with the principles under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In that regard, Trinidad and Tobago looks forward to active participation by all States in the Preparatory Committee on the development of an international legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction, for the benefit of all humankind.
The quest for economic and social justice for many cannot be divorced from the fervent desire of all peoples to live in freedom and without fear of persecution. In that regard, the growing religious and ethnic diversity of our societies highlights the ever-present need for mutual respect and appreciation for the value of diversity that today is a defining characteristic of many countries and communities. A lack of such tolerance and respect for human rights and human diversity has
15-29822 25/29

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
fuelled once again in our lifetime the horrific crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression. With a view to ensuring accountability for those accused of committing such crimes, and in order to act as a deterrent to would-be perpetrators, the international community established the International Criminal Court (ICC). Trinidad and Tobago calls upon all States that have not as yet done so to support the ICC.
We applaud the initiation of steps towards full rapprochement between the United States and Cuba, which has so far, among other things, been exemplified through the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the two States, thus reducing tensions in our hemisphere. Trinidad and Tobago hopes that, sooner rather than later, that process will mature with the lifting of the anachronistic economic embargo and blockade that for too long has undermined the economic development of Cuba.
While we are very much encouraged by the easing of tensions in the northern Caribbean with the resumption of dialogue between the United States and Cuba, we are concerned by the recent developments surrounding the protracted border controversy between our neighbours, Venezuela and Guyana. Trinidad and Tobago remains convinced that the controversy should be settled by pacific means in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations.
At the same time, Trinidad and Tobago reiterates the position of the Caribbean Community on the matter concerning citizens of the Dominican Republic of Haitian ancestry and calls on the Dominican Republic to ensure that the human rights of these citizens do not continue to be infringed and are honoured in accordance with international law.
Once again, the failure to find a permanent solution to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict remains of deep concern to Trinidad and Tobago. That situation affects the ability of both sides to live in peace and security and also impinges on the right of the Palestinians to self-determination. It is our hope that both sides will work together with others in resolving this decades-old problem, resulting in the establishment of a Palestinian State with clearly defined borders, coexisting in peace and security alongside the State of Israel.
The United Nations must adapt to the ever-changing geopolitical environment as well as the emerging economic and social landscape. Trinidad and Tobago
therefore emphasizes the imperative to move with greater alacrity on the question of the revitalization of the General Assembly in order to ensure the effective execution of its mandate. The General Assembly is the only institution or grouping of States that possesses the inclusiveness, and indeed the legitimacy, to act on behalf of the international community. We must therefore spare no effort to make it a more effective and dynamic instrument in the service of all the peoples of the world, elevating none about others and respecting and defending the rights of all.
Trinidad and Tobago commits to continue to play its part at the regional and global levels to ensure that we avoid the pitfalls experienced by the United Nations. We will work faithfully with others to build on the tremendous progress made by this institution over the seven decades of its life in order to bring about a greater commitment by all States to peace, security and human rights for all peoples of the world so that they may live in larger freedom and continuing prosperity.
"
70,2015,GNB,"His Excellency Mr. José Mario Vaz, President of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, has honoured me with the task of conveying his congratulations to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its historic seventieth session and wishes him great success. We would also like to commend his predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa of Uganda, for the wise and dignified manner in which he conducted the work at the sixty-ninth session. The President’s election to the General Assembly at the seventieth session takes place at a time when the nations of the world decided to adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), thereby leading humankind in a new direction and promoting a more just world for all. We believe that with his extensive experience and under his leadership, we can begin effectively implementing the Agenda.
As we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, which coincides with the forty-second anniversary of our country’s own independence, Guinea-Bissau continues to experience instability. That is reflected in its vulnerabilities and its difficulties in establishing the foundations necessary for the creation of a stable State. Those foundations are primarily geared to development, in fulfilment of the dream of Amílcar Cabral, the father of the nation. While other nations in the world are able to seize this moment to strengthen their statehood and consolidate their institutions, Guinea-Bissau continues to look for solutions to our various domestic problems. The current political situation in Guinea-Bissau shows that our country is still striving to move from fragility to stability.
Despite the recurrent instability, the people of Guinea-Bissau have never doubted the viability of our country, as we believe in our ability to overcome that challenge once again. Our determination to build the viable State we dream of is and will always remain intact. Our ability to overcome difficulties and perform great feats was gloriously demonstrated by our fighters for the freedom of the homeland, who brought about our independence 42 years ago in an exemplary manner, under the wise leadership of our much missed Amílcar Cabral and in the context of his minimum programme.
Today, more than ever, we are determined to achieve the maximum programme in that glorious struggle and to promote social and economic development and environmental conservation. Since our return to constitutional normality with the installation of the Government that emerged from the April 2014 legislative elections, together with the establishment of other institutions of sovereignty, we have striven to provide the basic conditions required to relaunch our country’s economy and to address the new challenges for peacebuilding and security.
To that end, the 2015-2025 Terra Ranka development strategy, presented in March 2015 in Brussels, was fully discussed and approved at the national level and strongly supported by the international community. It will provide continuity for the actions of the Government, which is currently led by Carlos Correia. That development strategy is also consistent with the Goals established in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted one week ago by the General Assembly. We are convinced that the full implementation of the Agenda will greatly contribute, not only to our country’s sustainable development, but also to establishing, once and for all, the necessary conditions for peace and stability in our country. In that regard, once again, from this rostrum, I appeal to the partners and friends of Guinea-Bissau to honour the commitments undertaken in Brussels and not to frustrate the enormous expectations of the people of Guinea-Bissau, who have mobilized around that strategy.
Conflict resolution was one of the primary goals that led to the establishment of our Organization in 1945. And today, that same goal continues to be a priority and one of our greatest challenges. Current conflicts have emerged for a variety of reasons and taken on ever more complex forms, making them even more difficult to resolve. There is no political or geopolitical justification for the United Nations to find itself in an impasse when addressing the tragedies caused by the conflicts in the Middle East and other regions of the world, which have created one of the greatest refugee crises ever recorded. We have the moral responsibility to find a solution. In that regard, I would like to commend the European Union and other countries for the solidarity that they have shown in providing the required humanitarian assistance and welcoming those refugees.
Issues related to the African continent continue to predominate on the agenda of the Security Council, and
14/18 15-29940

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27
nine of the 16 United Nations peacekeeping operations are in African countries. Therefore, the views of that continent and its 54 countries must be heard and considered when decisions on the management of conflicts are taken. Our legitimate claim for two permanent seats and broader representation as non-permanent members on the Security Council must be heeded. We call again for a reform of the Security Council, based on our belief that the historical reasons for the establishment of the Organization are no longer valid as they do not reflect the current political reality in the world. We also express our support for permanent seats for Brazil, India, Japan and Germany.
We continue to believe that preventive diplomacy can be more efficient in preventing and resolving conflicts. We believe that the best way to prevent conflicts would be to invest more in combating poverty, promoting gender equality, education and the struggle against social discrimination, and preserving the environment.
The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is without a doubt a step in the right direction, and Guinea-Bissau reiterates its commitment to achieving the Agenda in accordance with its precise terms. To this end, the fulfilment of the commitments undertaken by our partners with respect to official development assistance and other funds for development becomes critical for the most vulnerable countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, such as Guinea-Bissau.
For many years, it has been a tradition for our country to appeal from this rostrum for the lifting of the economic and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba. Today, we would like to welcome the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, which had been broken off since 1961. Since the Cuban people should be able to take full advantage of their potential and freely pursue economic and financial relations with other States and peoples of the world, we encourage the United States of America and Cuba to proceed with negotiations towards the normalization of their relations and the total lifting of the embargo.
We hope and wish that the main actors in the Israeli- Palestinian peace process can draw inspiration from that example and engage in diplomatic negotiations with a view to the peaceful coexistence of two States.
We welcome the nuclear agreement between the international community and Iran and hope that it will result in the normalization of relations with the rest of world and the international community. We firmly believe that the world will be totally secure only if there is general and complete nuclear disarmament.
Climate change is an undeniable reality and is a dangerous threat to the existence of humankind. In that regard, it is important that we all pledge to fulfil our responsibilities with respect to the environment and that we all commit to protecting the planet in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The session of the Conference of the Parties that will take place in Paris in December will undoubtedly offer a new opportunity for the world to rectify its behaviour with respect to nature. We are looking for robust commitments on the part of Member States to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing the necessary funds for developing countries to address environmental challenges.
I cannot conclude my statement without expressing our gratitude to all our development partners, the United Nations in particular, for their continued follow-up on the situation in our country, and for the commitments they made at the Brussels round table last March on financing our strategic operational programme of development. Guinea-Bissau and its people are counting on all of you.
"
70,2015,ISR,"I bring greetings from Jerusalem, the city in which the Jewish people’s hopes and prayers for peace for all of humanity have echoed throughout the ages.
Thirty-one years ago, as Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, I stood at this rostrum for the first time. I spoke that day against a draft resolution sponsored by Iran to expel Israel from the United Nations. Then, as now, the United Nations was obsessively hostile towards Israel, the one true democracy in the Middle East. Then, as now, some sought to deny the one and only Jewish State a place among nations. I ended that first speech by saying, “Gentlemen, check your fanaticism at the door” (A/39/PV.32, para. 83).
More than three decades later, as the Prime Minister of Israel, I am again privileged to speak from this rostrum. And for me, that privilege has always come with a moral responsibility to speak the truth. So after three days of listening to world leaders praise the nuclear deal with Iran, I begin my speech today by saying, “Ladies and gentlemen, check your enthusiasm at the door”. The deal does not make peace more likely.
By fuelling Iran’s aggressions with billions of dollars in sanctions relief, it makes war more likely.
Just look at what Iran has done in the past six months alone, since the framework agreement was announced in Lausanne. Iran boosted its supply of devastating weapons to Syria. Iran sent more soldiers of its Revolutionary Guard into Syria. Iran sent thousands of Afghani and Pakistani Shiite fighters to Syria. Iran did all that to prop up Al-Assad’s brutal regime. Iran also shipped tons of weapons and ammunition to the Houthi rebels in Yemen, including another shipment just two days ago. Iran threatened to topple Jordan. Iran’s proxy, Hizbullah, smuggled into Lebanon SA-22 missiles to down our planes and Yakhont cruise missiles to sink our ships. Iran supplied Hizbullah with precision-guided surface-to-surface missiles and attack drones so it can accurately hit any target in Israel. Iran aided Hamas and Islamic Jihad in building armed drones in Gaza. Iran also made clear its plans to open two new terror fronts against Israel, promising to arm Palestinians in the West Bank and sending its Revolutionary Guard generals to the Golan Heights, from which its operatives recently fired rockets on northern Israel.
Israel will continue to respond forcefully to any attacks against it from Syria. Israel will continue to act to prevent the transfer of strategic weapons to Hizbullah from and through Syrian territory. Every few weeks, Iran and Hizbullah set up new terrorist cells in cities throughout the world. Three such cells were recently uncovered in Kuwait, Jordan and Cyprus. In May, security forces in Cyprus raided a Hizbullah agent’s apartment in the city of Larnaca. There they found five tons of ammonium nitrate — roughly the same amount of ammonium nitrate used to blow up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. And that was just in one apartment, in one city, in one country. But Iran is setting up dozens of terrorist cells like that around the world. They are setting up those terror cells in this hemisphere as well.
I repeat, Iran has been doing all of this — everything that I have just described — just within the past six months, when it was trying to convince the world to remove the sanctions. Just imagine what Iran will do after those sanctions are lifted. Unleashed and unmuzzled, Iran will go on the prowl, devouring more and more prey. In the wake of the nuclear deal, Iran is spending billions of dollars on weapons and satellites. Does anyone here think that Iran is doing that to
15-29658 27/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
advance peace? Does anyone here think that hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief and fat contracts will turn that rapacious tiger into a kitten? People who think so should think again.
In 2013, President Rouhani began his so-called charm offensive here at the United Nations. Two years later, Iran is executing more political prisoners, escalating its regional aggression and rapidly expanding its global terror net. They say that actions speak louder than words, but, in Iran’s case, their words speak as loudly as their actions. Just listen to the Deputy Commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Qods Force. In February, he said that “the Islamic Revolution is not limited by geographic borders”. He boasted that Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Yemen are among the countries being “conquered by the Islamic Republic of Iran”. He said “conquered”.
For those here who believe that the deal in Vienna will bring about a change in Iran’s policy, listen to what Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, said five days after the nuclear deal was reached: “Our policies towards the arrogant Government of the United States will not change”. The United States, he vowed, will continue to be Iran’s enemy. While giving the mullahs more money is likely to fuel more repression inside Iran, it will definitely fuel more aggression outside Iran.
As the leader of a country defending itself every day against Iran’s growing aggression, I wish that I could take comfort in the claim that this deal blocks Iran’s path to nuclear weapons, but I cannot, because it does not. This deal does place several constraints on Iran’s nuclear programme, and rightly so, because the international community recognizes that Iran is particularly dangerous. But, here is the catch. Under this deal, if Iran does not change its behaviour — in fact, even if it becomes more dangerous in the years to come — the most important constraints will still be automatically lifted by year 10 and by year 15. That would place a militant Islamic terror regime weeks away from having the fissile material for an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs. That just does not make any sense.
I have said that if Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country. This deal will treat Iran like a normal country even if it remains a dark theocracy that conquers its neighbours, sponsors terrorism worldwide and chants, “Death to Israel, death to America!” Does anyone seriously
believe that flooding a radical theocracy with weapons and cash will curb its appetite for aggression? Does anyone here really believe that a theocratic Iran with sharper claws and sharper fangs will be more likely to change its stripes? There is a general rule that I have learned — and that that those here must have learned it in their lifetime — which is that when bad behaviour is rewarded, it only gets worse.
I have long said that the greatest danger that the world faces is the coupling of militant Islam with nuclear weapons. I am gravely concerned that the nuclear deal with Iran will prove to be the marriage certificate of that unholy union. I know that some well-intentioned people sincerely believe that this deal is the best way to block Iran’s path to the bomb. However, one of history’s most important, yet least learned lessons, is that the best intentions do not prevent the worst outcomes. The vast majority of Israelis believe that this nuclear deal with Iran is a very bad deal. What makes matters even worse is that we see the world celebrating this bad deal, rushing to embrace and do business with a regime that is openly committed to our destruction.
Last week, Major General Salehi, the Commander of Iran’s Army, proclaimed
“We will annihilate Israel, for sure. We are glad that we are in the forefront of executing the Supreme Leader’s order to destroy Israel.”
As for the Supreme Leader himself, a few days after the nuclear deal was announced, he released his latest book. It is a 400-page screed detailing his plan to destroy the State of Israel. Last month, Khamenei once again made his genocidal intentions clear. Before Iran’s top clerical body, the Assembly of Experts, he spoke about Israel, which is home to over 6 million Jews. He pledged that “there will be no Israel in 25 years”. Seventy years after the murder of 6 million Jews, Iran’s rulers promise to destroy my country, murder my people, and the response from this body, the response from nearly every one of the Governments represented here, has been absolutely nothing — utter silence, deafening silence.
Perhaps members of the Assembly can now understand why Israel is not joining in the general celebration of the deal. If Iran’s rulers were working to destroy other members’ countries, perhaps they would be less enthusiastic about the deal. If Iran’s terror proxies were firing thousands of rockets at other members’ cities, perhaps they would be more measured in their praise. And if the deal were unleashing a nuclear
28/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
arms race in their neighbourhoods, perhaps they would be more reluctant to celebrate.
But no one should think that Iran is a danger only to Israel. Besides Iran’s aggression in the Middle East and its terror campaign around the world, Iran is also building intercontinental ballistic missiles whose sole purpose is to carry nuclear warheads. Now this fact needs to be remembered: Iran already has missiles that can reach Israel. So those intercontinental ballistic missiles that Iran is building are not meant for us. They are meant for others — for Europe, for America, for raining down mass destruction anytime, anywhere.
It is not easy to oppose something that is embraced by the greatest Powers in the world. Believe me, it would be far easier to remain silent. But throughout our history, the Jewish people have learned the heavy price of silence. And as the Prime Minister of the Jewish State, as someone who knows that history, I refuse to be silent. I will say it again. The days when the Jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies — those days are over. Not being passive means speaking up about those dangers. We have spoken up, we are speaking up, and we will continue to do so. Not being passive also means defending ourselves against those dangers. We have. We are. And we will.
Israel will not allow Iran to break in, to sneak in or to walk into the nuclear-weapons club. I know that preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons remains the official policy of the international community. But no one should question Israel’s determination to defend itself against those who seek our destruction. For in every generation, there have been those who sought to destroy our people. In antiquity, we faced destruction from the ancient empires of Babylon and Rome. In the Middle Ages, we faced inquisitions and expulsions. And in modern times, we faced pogroms and the Holocaust. Yet the Jewish people persevered.
And now another regime has arisen, swearing to destroy Israel. That regime would be wise to consider this fact: I stand here today representing Israel, a country that is 67 years young but is the nation State of a people nearly 4,000 years old. The empires of Babylon and Rome are not represented in this Hall of nations, nor is the 1,000-year Reich. Those seemingly invincible empires are long gone. But Israel lives. The people of Israel live.
The rebirth of Israel is a testament to the indomitable spirit of my people. For a hundred generations, the
Jewish people dreamed of returning to the land of Israel. Even in our darkest hours — and we had so many — even in our darkest hours, we never gave up hope of rebuilding our eternal capital, Jerusalem. The establishment of Israel made it possible to realize that dream. It has enabled us to live as a free people in our ancestral homeland. It has enabled us to embrace Jews who have come from the four corners of the Earth to find refuge from persecution. They have come from war-torn Europe, from Yemen, Iraq, and Morocco, from Ethiopia and the Soviet Union, from a hundred other lands. And today, as a rising tide of anti-Semitism once again sweeps across Europe and elsewhere, many Jews come to Israel to join us in building the Jewish future.
So here is my message to the rulers of Iran. Their plan to destroy Israel will fail. Israel will not permit any force on Earth to threaten its future. And here is my message to all the countries represented here. Whatever resolutions they may adopt in this building, whatever decisions they may take in their capitals, Israel will do whatever it must do to defend our State and to defend our people.
As the deal with Iran moves ahead, I hope it will be enforced — how can I put this? — with a little more rigour than was shown with the six Security Council resolutions that Iran has systematically violated and which now have been effectively discarded. I would call for ensuring that the inspectors actually inspect, that the snapback sanctions actually snap back, and that Iran’s violations not be swept under the Persian rug. There is one thing I can assure the Assembly of today that Israel will be watching closely.
What the international community now needs to do is clear: first, it must make Iran comply with all its nuclear obligations, and hold Iran’s feet to the fire. Secondly, Iran’s regional aggression must be put in check by supporting and strengthening those fighting Iran’s aggression, beginning with Israel. Thirdly, use sanctions and all the tools available to tear down Iran’s global terror network.
Israel is working closely with our Arab peace partners to address our common security challenges from Iran and also the security challenges from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and from others. We are also working with other States in the Middle East, as well as with countries in Africa, in Asia and beyond. Many in our region know that both Iran and ISIL are our common enemies. And when
15-29658 29/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
one’s enemies fight each other, one does not strengthen either one. One weakens both.
Common dangers are clearly bringing Israel and its Arab neighbours closer. As we work together to thwart the dangers that I have mentioned, I hope that we will build lasting partnerships for security, for prosperity and for peace. But in Israel, we never forget one thing. We never forget that Israel’s most important partner has always been, and will always be, the United States of America. The alliance between Israel and the United States is unshakeable.
President Obama and I agree on the need to keep arms out of the hands of Iran’s terror proxies. We agree on the need to stop Iran from destabilizing countries throughout the Middle East. Israel deeply appreciates President Obama’s willingness to bolster our security and to help Israel maintain its qualitative military edge in order to confront the enormous challenges we face. Israel is grateful that this sentiment is widely shared by the American people and its representatives in Congress — both by those who supported the deal and by those who opposed it.
President Obama and I have both said that our differences over the nuclear deal are a disagreement within the family. But we have no disagreement about the need to work together to secure our common future. And what a great future it could be. Israel is uniquely poised to take advantage of the promise of the twenty-first century. Israel is a world leader in science and technology, in cybertechnology, software, water, agriculture, medicine, biotechnology and so many other fields that are being revolutionized by Israeli ingenuity and Israeli innovation. Israel is the innovation nation. Israeli know-how is everywhere. It is in our computers’ microprocessors and flash drives. It is in our smart phones, when we send instant messages and navigate our cars. It is on our farms, when we drip-irrigate our crops and keep our grains and produce fresh. It is in our universities, when we study Nobel Prize-winning discoveries in chemistry and economics. It is in our medicine cabinets, when we use drugs to treat Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. It is even on our plates, when we eat delicious cherry tomatoes. They were also perfected in Israel, in case someone did not know.
We are so proud in Israel of the long strides that our country has been able to take in a short time. We are so proud that our small country is making such a huge contribution to the entire world. Yet the dreams of
our people, enshrined for eternity by the great prophets of the Bible, will be fully realized only when there is peace.
As the Middle East descends into chaos, Israel’s peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan are two cornerstones of stability. Israel remains committed to achieving peace with the Palestinians as well. Israelis know the price of war. I know the price of war. I was nearly killed in battle. I lost many friends. I lost my beloved brother Yoni. Those who know the price of war can best appreciate what the blessings of peace would mean — for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. I am prepared to immediately resume direct peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority without any preconditions whatsoever. Unfortunately, President Abbas said yesterday that he is not prepared to do that. I hope he changes his mind, because I remain committed to a vision of two States for two peoples, in which a demilitarized Palestinian State recognizes the Jewish State.
As members know, the peace process began over two decades ago. Yet despite the best efforts of six Israeli prime ministers — Rabin, Peres, Barak, Sharon, Olmert and myself — the Palestinians have consistently refused to end the conflict and to make a final peace with Israel. Unfortunately, we heard that rejectionism again only yesterday from President Abbas. How can Israel make peace with a Palestinian partner who refuses to even sit at the negotiating table? Israel expects the Palestinian Authority to abide by its commitments. The Palestinians should not walk away from peace. I would like to tell President Abbas that I know it is not easy. I know it is hard. But we owe it to our peoples to try, to continue to try. If we actually sit down together, if we actually negotiate and stop negotiating about the negotiation, and if we actually sit down to try to resolve the conflict between us, recognizing each other and not using a Palestinian State as a stepping stone for yet another Islamist dictatorship in the Middle East but as something that will live at peace next to the Jewish State, we can do remarkable things for our peoples.
The United Nations can help advance peace by supporting direct, unconditional negotiations between the parties. The United Nations will certainly not help advance peace by trying to impose solutions or by encouraging Palestinian rejectionism, And the United Nations should do one more thing. The United Nations should finally rid itself of its obsessive bashing of Israel. Here is just one absurd example of
30/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
that obsession. In the four years of horrific violence in Syria, more than a quarter of a million people have lost their lives. That is more than 10 times the number of Israelis and Palestinians combined who have lost their lives in a century of conflict between us. Yet last year, the Assembly adopted 20 resolutions against Israel and only one resolution about the savage slaughter in Syria. Talk about injustice. Talk about disproportionality. Count them: 20. And one against Syria. Well, frankly I am not surprised. To borrow a line from Yogi Berra, the late, great baseball player and part-time philosopher, when it comes to the annual bashing of Israel at the United Nations, it is déjà vu all over again.
Enough is enough. Today, 31 years after I stood here for the first time, I am still asking when the United Nations will finally check its anti-Israel fanaticism at the door, when the United Nations will finally stop slandering Israel as a threat to peace and when it will actually start helping Israel advance peace. The same question should be posed to Palestinian leaders. When will they start working with Israel to advance peace and reconciliation, stop libelling Israel and stop inciting hatred and violence?
Here is a good place for President Abbas to begin. He should stop spreading lies about Israel’s alleged intentions on the Temple Mount. Israel is fully committed to maintaining the status quo there. What President Abbas should be speaking out against are the actions of the militant Islamists who are smuggling explosives into the Al-Aqsa Mosque and who are trying to prevent Jews and Christians from visiting the holy sites. That is the real threat to those sacred sites.
A thousand years before the birth of Christianity, more than 1,500 years before the birth of Islam, King David made Jerusalem our capital, and King Solomon built the Temple on that Mount. Yet Israel will always respect the sacred shrines of all religions. In a region plagued by violence and by unimaginable intolerance, in which Islamic fanatics are destroying the ancient treasures of civilization, Israel stands out as a towering beacon of enlightenment and tolerance. Far from endangering the holy sites, Israel ensures their safety. Because, unlike the Powers that ruled Jerusalem in the past, Israel respects the holy sites and the freedom of worship of Jews, Muslims, Christians — everyone. And that will never change.
Because Israel will always stay true to its values. Those values are on display each and every day. They are on display when Israel’s feisty parliament
vigorously debates every issue under the sun; when Israel’s Chief Justice sits in her chair at our fiercely independent Supreme Court; when our Christian community continues to grow and thrive from year to year, whereas Christian communities elsewhere in the Middle East are decimated; when a brilliant young Israeli Muslim student gives her valedictorian address at one of our finest universities; and when Israeli doctors and nurses — doctors and nurses from the Israeli military — treat thousands of wounded from the killing fields of Syria and thousands more in the wake of natural disasters from Haiti to Nepal. That is the true face of Israel. Those are the values of Israel.
In the Middle East, those values are under savage assault by militant Islamists, who are forcing millions of terrified people to flee to distant shores. Just 10 miles from ISIS and a few hundred yards from Iran’s murderous proxies, Israel stands in the breach, proudly and courageously defending freedom and progress. Israel is civilization’s front line in the battle against barbarism. So here is a novel idea for the United Nations. Instead of continuing the shameful routine of bashing Israel, the international community should stand with Israel. The international community should stand with Israel as we work to check the fanaticism at its doors. It should stand with Israel as we prevent that fanaticism from even reaching its doors. The international community should stand with Israel because Israel is not just defending itself. More than ever, Israel is defending the world!

anniversary of the founding of the global body. Our forefathers were inspired to establish the Organization based on the clear recognition that we share a common destiny. Since its inception, the United Nations has made remarkable strides in advancing peace and security, human rights and development. Seventy years on, it continues to inspire the shared dreams and aspirations of all humankind.
This is a critical year for sustainable development. The third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa and the recently concluded United Nations Summit on the post-2015 development agenda here in New York have ushered in new hope for the peoples of the world. With our drive to achieve a meaningful climate change agreement in Paris this year, we hope to transform our future by ending poverty, limiting climate change and preserving our planet.
Two global challenges pose the greatest threat to the sustainability of human civilization. First, terrorism and violent extremism remain major impediments to global peace and development. Terrorists do not subscribe to any religion. Terrorism and violent extremism are global challenges. All countries should unite to effectively address those challenges.
I, myself, am a victim of terrorism and violent extremism. My father, the father of the nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and my mother, Begum Fazilatunnesa Mujib, and three brothers, as well as other close relatives, were brutally assassinated on 15 August 1975. I, myself, have been subjected to terrorist attacks at least 19 times. My Government, therefore, maintains a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of terrorism, violent extremism and radicalization. We remain steadfast in tackling the extremist and anti-liberation forces that remain active in their aim to destroy the democratic, progressive and secular ethos of our nation.
Secondly, climate change poses formidable development challenges. We will be unable to sustain our development endeavours without effectively addressing climate change. The new 2030 development agenda makes it clear that all our actions need to be underpinned by a strong commitment to protecting and preserving our planet, biodiversity and climate. With only a small window of opportunity, we must succeed in setting the world on a safer, greener and more prosperous course.
We realize that regional cooperation is critical in fostering sustainable development and achieving peaceful, stable societies. Bangladesh has taken the lead in building regional cooperation processes such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation and the Bangladesh-China- India-Myanmar Economic Corridor. We have also taken the initiative of developing infrastructure to enhance trade and people-to-people contacts in relations among Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal.
Today we are witnessing unprecedented migration and human mobility that is reshaping history and geography. Migration has been recognized as a key enabler of development in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). Cooperation among our countries is essential if we are to harness the full potential of migration. With that objective, we have decided to lead the Global Forum on Migration and Development in 2016.
Over the years, peacekeeping and peacebuilding have emerged as United Nations flagship activities. Bangladesh is proud to be associated with those endeavours as a leading troop-contributing country. Our valiant peacekeepers have so far made their mark in 54 peacekeeping missions in 40 countries. We have the distinction of having the highest number of female police personnel participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions. Our contribution to United Nations peace operations has made us a reliable partner in United Nations peace initiatives.
Development efforts in many of our countries over the past 15 years have been largely guided by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The overall progress made in implementing the MDGs inspired us to adopt a bigger, bolder and more ambitious set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Given the ambition reflected in the SDGs, we surely will need to scale up the mobilization of resources from public, private, domestic and international spheres. It is essential that developed countries fulfil their official development assistance commitment of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to developing countries, and 0.2 per cent to the least developed countries. We also need to address the challenges faced by developing countries in accessing environmentally sound technology. Without such technology transfers and capacity-building, I am afraid that many development goals and targets will never be achieved.

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
Over four decades ago, the father of our nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in his maiden speech before the General Assembly, envisioned “the building of a world order in which the aspiration of all men for peace and justice will be realized” (A/PV.2243, para. 2) and freedom from poverty, hunger, exploitation and aggression. That clarion call continues to guide our development pursuits and engagement in global affairs. We continue to transform Bangladesh into a land where the rule of law and social justice prevail over poverty, inequality, impunity and exclusion. I have presented the Vision 2021 initiative, towards a middle-income, knowledge-driven economy in what we are calling a “digital Bangladesh”. With our steady progress so far, I am confident that we will soon realize the dream of the father of the nation of building sonar Bangla, or “golden Bangladesh”.
Bangladesh is widely recognized today as a role model for the developing world. We have one of the fastest poverty reduction rates in the world, despite a modest resource base; our poverty rate has fallen from 56.7 per cent in 1991 to 22.4 per cent today. Bangladesh has already met or is on track to meet MDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. During the past six years, our average gross domestic product growth has remained at about 6.2 per cent, despite the global recession; from 2005 to 2015, our export earnings have increased more than threefold; during the same period, foreign currency reserves have jumped by a factor of 7.5, from $3.5 billion to $26 billion. Moreover, during the same period, Bangladesh has graduated from the United Nations Development Programme low human development category to the medium category, and from the World Bank’s lower-income country status to lower-middle income.
We realize that investments in human capital that target our large youth population would pay rich dividends. That is why our Government has placed particular emphasis on education and health care for all. We now offer stipends to 13.4 million poor students enrolled in sixth grade to the undergraduate level and free education for girls up to the higher secondary level in order to address the challenge of student drop-outs. On the first day of this year, we distributed over 326.35 million free text books throughout the country. Since 2010, nearly 1.59 billion text books have been distributed. This is perhaps the biggest such undertaking anywhere in the world. Our people living in rural areas receive over 200 services from over 5,275
digital centres. They have access to health-care services through more than 16,500 technology-connected health complexes.
We have seen the visible results of women’s economic and political empowerment by promoting their greater access to productive resources and representation at the national and local levels. Likewise, we attach priority to addressing the needs and challenges of the various vulnerable segments of our population. Our lead role in the United Nations promotion of the rights and well- being of persons affected by autism and other neuro- developmental disabilities arose from our efforts to build an inclusive society.
As we did during the MDG era, we would like to lead by example in implementing the SDGs in Bangladesh. Attaching due importance to the SDG framework, we are currently developing the next five-year plan for 2016-2020. My Government is determined to ensure that no one is left behind in our aspiration to build a resilient, peaceful and prosperous society. We believe that sustainable development cannot be achieved in the absence of durable peace and security. We remain committed, as ever, to upholding peace and the rule of law and to putting an end to the culture of impunity. In that spirit, we are pursuing the perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity, rape and genocide committed during our 1971 Liberation War.
Our Government attaches the utmost importance to preserving the religious harmony and tolerance that have nurtured our social fabric throughout the ages. We have recently settled maritime and land boundary demarcations and related issues with our neighbours India and Myanmar. At the stroke of midnight on 31 July, we exchanged 162 enclaves with India, whereby more than 50,000 stateless enclave residents obtained their much-cherished citizenship. That brought to a peaceful end the lingering humanitarian situation of the enclave residents. By so doing, jointly with India, we have set a unique precedent for the rest of the world.
In that spirit, I urge the comity of nations to renew our collective resolve to achieve a peaceful, stable and prosperous world free from poverty and inequality, violence and extremism, climate change and conflict, and oppression and injustice. Let us demonstrate foresight, moral courage and political leadership in building a better life and brighter future for all of our

children. May Bangladesh live forever! Long live the United Nations!
"
70,2015,ARM,"I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the post of President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I am confident that, under your able leadership, this jubilee session will meet our many hopes and expectations.
I also congratulate all of us on the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. The establishment of the Organization is one of the greatest achievements of humankind, a step that has consolidated nations around its shared aspirations and principles. The past 70 years have been characterized by very important positive developments, namely, an end was put to colonialism, racial discrimination and apartheid. Many people around the world exercised their right to self- determination and took charge of their own fates by
establishing and building independent States of their own, thus increasing the number of United Nations States Members from 51 to today’s 193.
Amid all those achievements, we recognize that the world currently faces new challenges, such as terrorism, extremism, intolerance, economic crises, climate change, human trafficking, organ trafficking and trafficking in drugs and arms, a migration crisis and others. The list of those challenges is long. The profound need to struggle against them obliges us to resolutely reiterate our joint commitment to the mission of the Organization and the Charter of the United Nations.
Last year, on the eve of the centennial of the Armenian genocide, I expressed from this rostrum our gratitude to the nations that had recognized the Armenian genocide, and I named each State individually (see A/69/PV.6). I called upon the international community to strengthen the struggle against the recurrence of the crime of genocide recognizing and condemning its occurrence. Today, from this same rostrum, I would like to thank Pope Francis and to acknowledge the historic mass he served. I also wish to thank the European Parliament and to recall the resolution it adopted. In addition, the well-known statement by the German President will, believe me, henceforth be found in the annals of our nation’s history.
In that connection, I thank the legislative bodies of Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, as well as numerous provincial and city councils and hundreds of political and non-governmental
organizations. I also thank the Presidents of Russia, France, Cyprus and Serbia, as well as the delegations of numerous other countries that came on 24 April to pay tribute to the victims of the Armenian genocide in Yerevan. Our determination to keep the prevention of the crime of genocide on the international agenda is demonstrated by the resolutions that we periodically submit to the Human Rights Council. The latest resolution to that effect was adopted this year. Building further upon that, just a few days ago, the Assembly adopted resolution 69/323, establishing 9 December as the International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the Prevention of This Crime.
The peaceful resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh problem remains one of the most salient issues in our region. I must note that the aggressive policy pursued by Azerbaijan has resulted in the absence of any meaningful progress in the negotiations to reach a settlement of the conflict, and the situation has drifted towards increasing tension. The dictatorial regime of that country has used disgraceful repression as an instrument to strangle the people’s wrath, as the oil- based economy obviously falters. Even that policy it now considers to be ineffective. Now it requires images from the line of contact in order to divert the attention of its own public. I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to the fact that Azerbaijan, besides various other provocative actions, has now started to use heavy artillery, firing at the peaceful settlements of the bordering districts of both the Republic of Armenia and the Nagorno Karabakh Republic.
Just a few days ago, in the border area of Armenia, three women fell victim to an Azerbaijani bombardment in their houses and in their gardens, where they were peacefully working. The question that comes to mind is whether any reasonable person can see any valid logic in that cruelty. It is obvious to us that the Azerbaijani leadership has irreversibly lost both its sense of reality and its willingness to abide by the norms of human conduct.
Azerbaijan completely disdains the five joint statements issued by the Presidents of the United States of America, Russia and France, as well as the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Minsk Group. If that country continues its aggressive policy, Armenia will have no other choice but to take the necessary legal, political and military
steps to allow the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Nagorno Karabakh to develop in security and peace.
Although it is obvious to everybody which party has instigated and continues to instigate the ceasefire violations, I would still like to recall some facts. Is it not strange that, for years now, Azerbaijan has stubbornly refused to withdraw its snipers and establish an incident investigation mechanism, as proposed by the co-Chairs of the Minsk Group? The question that arises is, what is Azerbaijan afraid of?
Is it not strange that, during the European Games hosted by Azerbaijan, when the Government needed an image of stability, almost no shooting incidents occurred at the border, while immediately after those Games shooting incidents reoccurred on a prolonged basis? I do not expect members of the Assembly to buy the assertions of any one of the parties, but I still hope that everyone will exercise common sense. Is it not strange that in the twenty-first century our neighbour, day in and day out, relentlessly and indefatigably takes pride in its excessive accumulation of arms and the manifold expansion of its military budget? It stubbornly continues making bellicose threats that it intends to renew military hostilities, and that is done at the highest level, that of the head of State.
I think that everyone now understands why Armenia has consistently urged the international community to make statements that are not general, but unambiguous, with regard to the party to whom they are referring during discussions of the ceasefire violations. We must understand that to stifle early-warning signals with regard to threats to peace and security can have catastrophic repercussions.
Today, we are witnessing unspeakable barbarity taking place in the Middle East. Religious intolerance has brought irreversible consequences in its wake. We have been most directly affected by the atrocities unfolding there, since they have led to the destruction of parts of Armenia’s spiritual and cultural heritage and its artefacts and to the murder and expulsion of numerous Armenians residing in Iraq and Syria. The Armenian community of Syria, with its centuries-long history, shares and experiences all the hardships that the Syrian people are undergoing in these difficult times. We are trying to aid the refuges to the best of our abilities. Up to now, Armenia has hosted more than 16,000 refugees from Syria. That figure shows that Armenia is one of the leading host countries, together with the European host countries.

Armenians are well acquainted with the fate of refugees, of the exiled and expelled. The Armenian genocide would have claimed many more lives and the survivors would have gone through much greater hardship if a number of nations, our friends, had not lent us a helping hand in those difficult times. Today it is Germany, Sweden and a few other countries that deserve praise for the humanism that they have displayed. They have provided hundreds of thousands of refugees with safe haven, and have reiterated that that assistance was the right thing to do from both the legal and the humanist perspectives.
This year, we all witnessed how joint and adequate actions paved the way to mitigating a difficult international issue. A historic agreement was reached on the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran, an immediate neighbour of ours. That critical deal will undoubtedly contribute to the global settlement of conflict situations and the strengthening of mutual trust. Extended and consistent political and diplomatic efforts made the agreement possible.
All that proves that, when there is a political will to bridge disagreements and embrace a spirit of cooperation, solutions can indeed be found to the most complicated issues. From this rostrum, I would like once again to stress the importance of using diplomacy, especially to do away with closed borders. Our neighbours have subjected Armenia to an illegal blockade, and we deem such an improvident policy to be unacceptable, a policy that in the twenty-first century establishes artificial obstacles that disrupt intercultural, human-to-human and trade contacts. In that context, we highly value the periodic reviews carried out under the framework of the United Nations Conferences on Landlocked Developing Countries. We stand ready to invest further efforts in that endeavour, including by hosting intermediate workshops on that topic in our country.
To conclude, I would like to join all speakers who have called for joint efforts to combat darkness, atrocities and hatred. No country is too great or too small for that cause. Every single one has a role to play. Armenia stands ready to make its contribution to that joint struggle.
"
70,2015,LIE,"It is an honour to be back in the Assembly, especially as Liechtenstein is celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of its membership in the United Nations. We may not have been among the earliest countries to join the United Nations, but we certainly were and remain among those who did so with full conviction. Today, United Nations membership is a key platform for our Government’s foreign policy. The Organization enjoys strong approval among our population, two thirds of which have expressed favourable views in recent polls.
For people to approve of the United Nations is important, of course. After all, the Charter of the United Nations is explicitly written on behalf of the peoples of the world. But we must ask: what about people who are more directly affected by its work than the population of Liechtenstein? In celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, we must ask ourselves what would approval ratings be among the people of Syria, Haiti, the Central African Republic, Ukraine or Sri Lanka. Are we achieving the purposes of the Charter that we fought so hard for seventy years ago in San Francisco?
There is much to be proud of even when just looking back at the recent past. The United Nations- led response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa saved thousands of lives, and it has prepared us to act with even more resolve in the future. The Millennium Development Goals have had a catalytic effect on our development efforts and paved the way for the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), a visionary blueprint for sustainable development. The United Nations continues to provide emergency relief, education, health care and other services to millions of people around the globe. The United Nations is the strongest symbol for human rights, the rule of law, gender equality and the protection of vulnerable populations.
People around the world place their faith in the Organization, but all too often, they have been disappointed. It is true that the United Nations has a huge task. Mistakes are unavoidable, and at times, perhaps, the same can even be said of failure. Nonetheless, there can be no justification when the Organization fails at the very core of its mission. There is no justification when the very people who should be protecting civilians and children exploit them instead in the most abusive way possible. There is no justification for the failure of diplomacy in Syria, with civilians suffering from unspeakable violence and terrorist extremism taking over an entire region. We should not look for justifications. We need to look for solutions. We need to do better.
The maintenance of peace and security is at the heart of the Charter. Therefore, in the eyes of the world, the work of the Security Council has a decisive effect on whether the Organization as a whole is seen s a success or a failure. Like many others, we want the Security Council to act with resolve and be effective and be guided by a common sense of purpose. That is primarily the task of the Council members themselves. Others, however, must contribute, as well. The Council works on our behalf, and we are bound to carry out its decisions. In other words, we are all in this together, both in times of success and in times of failure.
Some of the Council’s most damaging failures have occurred in the face of atrocity crimes. Rwanda, Srebrenica and now Syria sadly stand out in that respect. When we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the Organization later in October, we should clearly acknowledge the damage done, and we should commit ourselves, therefore, to taking decisive action in the future when it is needed. To that end, Liechtenstein has led the discussion in the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group, which has resulted in a Code of Conduct regarding Security Council action against genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. That Code of Conduct is a voluntary political commitment that any State can enter into.
15-29816 31/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
The pledge is twofold. First, it is aimed at supporting timely and decisive action in the Security Council and at ending or preventing mass atrocity crimes — in other words, at being constructive. Secondly, it is aimed at not opposing credible draft resolutions put forward for the purpose of preventing such crimes — that is, at not being obstructive. Fifty-nine States have already made that commitment. I hope that many more will be on the list when we launch the Code of Conduct on 23 October, and I hope that that will give impetus to efforts aimed at finding agreement among the permanent members, who have the right of veto, in pursuit of the objective of preventing mass atrocity crimes.
Preventing mass atrocities is so important because their effects are irreversible. They have no remedy. How can one possibly make compensation for the slaughter of civilians, the mass rape of women or the brutalizing of children? Our primary objective must be to prevent those crimes from happening. That is a complex and long-term task, involving all parts of the United Nations system, but when volatile situations move closer to escalation, preventive diplomacy remains one of the most powerful tools at our disposal. Clearly, however, we need to make much stronger investments in it, both politically and financially.
As we consider how we can sharpen our tools for conflict prevention and resolution, one conclusion is already clear. We must get better at including women and their perspectives in those processes. The fifteenth anniversary of the women and peace and security agenda, laid out in Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), therefore marks a bittersweet moment. That agenda sets out a comprehensive vision for how to include women in peaceful solutions and how to protect them from the effects of armed conflict. It is in itself a remarkable achievement. Yet, we have, by and large, been unable to fulfil the promise made fifteen years ago. Girls born into a post-resolution 1325 (2000) world still suffer from abuse, sexual violence, forced recruitment and displacement. Let us take decisive steps forward when we meet later this month in the Security Council.
These are turbulent times, not just for the United Nations but also for an institution closely affiliated with it, the International Criminal Court (ICC). As the first treaty-based international court with jurisdiction over the worst crimes under international law, it is shouldering a massive responsibility. In just over ten years, the Court has established itself as the world’s central player in the fight against impunity.
It is an independent judicial institution and therefore does not engage in political calculations. Quite often, however, it finds itself forced to navigate a politically charged environment. We must, therefore, step up our support for the Court. More States should join the family of the current 123 parties to the Rome Statute. Consistent support should come from those who can, should or must cooperate with the Court, including the Security Council. We must also intensify and give greater assistance to national efforts to investigate and prosecute.
The link between the ICC and the United Nations will soon get stronger, thanks to the Kampala Amendments on the crime of aggression, which will enable the ICC to help enforce a core provision of the Charter of the United Nations, namely, the prohibition against the use of force. The most serious forms of the illegal use of force are no longer merely breaches of the Charter; they also entail criminal accountability for those responsible for such acts. We are only a little over a year’s time and a handful of ratifications away from activating the Court’s jurisdiction over that crime. We look forward to more States ratifying the Kampala consensus. It will be a big step, both for international criminal justice and for the United Nations.
Finally, let me offer some thoughts on the unprecedented levels of the displacement of persons in the world, which is quickly turning into one of the biggest challenges for the United Nations. Countries close to the conflicts have been grappling with that issue for quite some time already. More recently, Europe has been impacted in ways that test the fabric of our region. Even though we are not a member of the European Union, Liechtenstein feels strongly that Europe is not just a continent. It is also a symbol of common values and a promise to address challenges together, irrespective of our models of political and economic integration. We therefore want to contribute to a sustainable solution based on international law and human rights.
Regional approaches will remain key to such solutions. But migration and refugee flows are not simply a regional phenomenon, and by far the largest share of people who have left their homes are still in developing countries. A truly global discussion is therefore required, as well. The World Humanitarian Summit next year seems to offer a good and timely platform.
32/45 15-29816

We are confronting daunting challenges, yet to lose hope is not an option. Therefore, in closing, I would like to share with you the perspective of a man whom I greatly admire and who has extensively collaborated with Liechtenstein. In 1944, he landed on the shores of Normandy, he participated in the liberation of the concentration camps, and he led the prosecution in history’s biggest murder cases at the Nuremberg trials. He is now 95 years old and continues to fight for law, not war, as he has done all his life. His name is Benjamin Ferencz, and he has three pieces of advice for all of us: “Never give up. Never give up. Never give up.”
"
70,2015,EU,"I am here today to reassure the General Assembly that Europe is as committed to its values and objectives now as it has ever been. Europe will stay the course, even though it is now confronting challenges that we have not witnessed for decades. Wars are raging both to the south and east of our borders. European leaders are tackling the consequences of borders being changed on our continent by force — as is the case in Ukraine — in violation of the Charter of the United Nations. We are also dealing
with the refugee crisis, with terrorist attacks inside Europe and with economic difficulties in some member States.
As difficult as the situation is, I am sure that we will find ways of dealing with it and, most importantly, we will at the same time remain dedicated to helping make the whole world a better place. Everyone who wishes to contribute to eradicating poverty, supporting peacekeeping missions and solving the migration crisis, as well as handling the causes and effects of climate change, can still count on us. For Europe, isolationism has never been and never will be an option. We are always ready to listen to the good and sound advice from our friends on the unprecedented refugee and migrant crisis that we face today.
The myth prevails that Europe is the only rich place on Earth. That is not true. There are other places comparable to us in terms of wealth, but for some reason refugees and migrants are not flowing there. That is because wealth is not the only element that determines the place where people choose the future of their children. Values such as tolerance, openness, respect for diversity, freedom, human rights and those enshrined in the Geneva Convention are also a magnet attracting them to us.
And we refuse to change in those respects. If in Europe we are engaged in animated discussions on relocation quotas, it is because we care; it is because we seek to be as effective and as inclusive as possible. But establishing quotas are just a small part of what Europe is already doing to help those who flee wars and persecution. By contrast, many countries represented here deal with that problem in a much simpler way, namely, by not allowing migrants and refugees to enter their territories at all. That is why suggesting that Europe represents an example of poor treatment or indifference towards asylum-seekers is sheer hypocrisy. In fact, the opposite is true, as we can see from the direction of their travel. No one seems to be escaping from Europe, while people from all over Eurasia and Africa are coming to Europe. The crisis we are talking about has global dimensions and demands a global solution. First of all, it demands global solidarity. Everyone can offer help to the refugees, and those who do not want to should at least refrain from hiding their indifference by criticizing Europe for doing too little.
It is no coincidence that the general debate this year is focused mainly on the situation in the Middle
40/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
East, especially in Syria. Let us have no illusions. Syria’s crisis will not be resolved unless a common denominator of interests is found among the regional players. But a peace plan must not be only a formula for defining a new division of spheres of influence; here in the United Nations we should speak not only about the interests of the regional Powers but, above all, about the interests of millions of Syrians, including the internally displaced and refugees. The fight against terrorism is no doubt important in that context; that is why we welcome the fact that this objective is gaining the support of new and quite unexpected allies. But we cannot overlook the fact that many refugees are fleeing State terrorism, which is demonstrated dramatically by the case of Syria.
Europe, which every day witnesses the tragedies of millions of Syrian refugees, must be their advocate. We all want to see stable States in the region. Stabilization is a value beyond any dispute, but stability cannot be won by the use of barrel bombs and chemical weapons against civilians. Today, the circle of those proposing the idea that Bashar Al-Assad should be part of Syria’s transition is growing, yet we cannot forget that millions of people have fled his horrific methods of trying to secure stability in Syria. During my trips to the region, I was told that Al-Assad’s victory would lead only to further exodus. The only goal and intention of a peace plan for Syria must be to make it possible for the people to start leading normal lives in the region once again. That message, and that message alone, will be consistent with the values of the international community and the European Union, and with the values that the United Nations has held dear for more than 70 years.
This year will also be crucial in the global efforts to fight the causes and consequences of climate change. Over the past days and weeks, we have listened with great hope and satisfaction to the pledges of leaders committed to fighting global warming. Europe is determined that the Paris Climate Change Conference will be a breakthrough, symbolizing our readiness to undertake unified action in confronting that global problem.
With a pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 40 per cent of its 1990 levels, Europe remains in the lead of that process, but fighting global warming is not a sports competition. Victory is possible when everybody moves in the same direction and at a similar pace. That is why we invite all Member States to take part in that common endeavour. Without a global
agreement, Europe’s isolated efforts will be impractical. What matters for Europe is practical effects and not ideological fervour. Global challenges must be dealt with multilaterally or they will not be dealt with at all. We all have a duty to make the international community mean something real. We are facing multiple global emergencies. Let them pave the way to forge a global community that is truly strong, truly global and truly real.
"
70,2015,ZAF,"I should like to congratulate the President and his country, Denmark, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. He has South Africa’s full support for his presidency. The theme that he has chosen, “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”, is timely and relevant to the current global challenges facing the world today.
Furthermore, allow me to convey our gratitude to the President of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, Mr. Sam Kutesa of the Republic of Uganda, for the outstanding manner in which he represented Africa at the helm of the General Assembly during that session.
The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations marks a significant moment in the history of global governance. The Charter embodies, through its principles and objectives, the aspirations of oppressed people worldwide. We would also like to acknowledge the role of the United Nations General Assembly over the past 70 years. Rooted in the principle of sovereign equality, the Assembly is the most representative international institution and organ of the United Nations.
The General Assembly has over the years remained central to the provision of support to the disadvantaged, marginalized, occupied, colonized and oppressed peoples of the world. This body elevated the South African struggle for liberation internationally when it declared apartheid a crime against humanity.
Mr. Oliver Tambo, the former President of our liberation movement, the African National Congress, addressed the General Assembly from this very podium on 26 October 1976 (see A/31/PV.41) and spoke from other United Nations platforms as well on other occasions. Many other eminent South Africans were provided an opportunity in various United Nations forums to state our case for freedom, the United Nations providing a voice to the voiceless. A free South Africa has also been honoured by the declaration of 18 July as International Mandela Day, honouring our founding President and world icon, President Nelson Mandela. At this celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations I wish to extend, on behalf of the people
of South Africa, our sincere gratitude to the world for its contribution to our freedom from the shackles of apartheid and institutionalized racism.
The General Assembly continues to provide a voice for the voiceless and the oppressed. In an historic and landmark development the General Assembly approved a resolution to allow the Palestinian flag to fly in front of United Nations Headquarters (resolution 69/320). The resolution was passed by an overwhelming margin, supported by many nations from both the developed North and the developing South. There can be no peace, security and development in the Middle East without a resolution of the Palestinian question. A solution is urgent. Otherwise, if we delay, in the next decade we may no longer have a piece of land to justify the two- State solution.
The historic seventieth anniversary of the United Nations presents an opportunity to reflect on the structure and workings of the Organization. Significantly, this year marks the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) in 2005, which discussed reform of the United Nations.
A number of significant decisions on reform have been successfully implemented since that Summit. They include the following: the replacement of the Human Rights Commission with a more effective Human Rights Council, the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission as a subsidiary body of both the General Assembly and the Security Council, the reform and streamlining of the United Nations management system, the mainstreaming of gender equality through the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women),and the membership-driven responsibility to protect and to assist populations facing genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and ethnic cleansing. We welcome that notable progress.
However, almost no progress has been made on the commitment also made by Heads of State and Government in 2005 to the early reform of the Security Council. It is unacceptable and unjustifiable that more than 1 billion people in the African continent are still excluded from permanent membership in the key decision-making structure of the United Nations, the Security Council.
A continent with a smaller population than Africa is represented by three countries on the Security
Council as permanent members. That is unfair. The United Nations cannot pretend that the world has not changed since 1945. We are no longer colonies. We are free, independent sovereign States. We welcome the fact that the push for the reform of the Security Council coming from Africa has had an impact and has given some impetus to the intergovernmental negotiations process that has been looking at the reforms. We will continue working with progressive States towards the expansion of representation.
Another critical matter that needs attention is the selection of the Secretary-General, who is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council. A review of that process is necessary so as to enable more meaningful participation on the part of the General Assembly in the process.
The President has identified human rights, governance, the rule of law, and the gender aspects of the work of the United Nations as important areas of focus for the seventieth session of the General Assembly. We have to build upon the initial work undertaken in the development of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 to enhance protection in areas such as racism, discrimination against women and the promotion of the rights of the child and the rights of people with disabilities.
We also believe that the United Nations human rights system, especially its Human Rights Council, should ensure a balance between civil and political rights, on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, on the other. The Human Rights Council must also be seen as an independent and impartial mechanism for the entrenchment of a human rights culture throughout the world. It should avoid the pitfalls of its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights, which was beset by politicization and was caught up in the divide between developed and developing countries.
This year also marks 50 years since the adoption of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The year 2015 also marks 60 years since the adoption of the Freedom Charter in South Africa, which embodies the fundamental principles and values that are now enshrined in our Constitution. South Africa will continue to champion efforts in the United Nations human rights system to combat the scourges of racism, xenophobia, racial discrimination and related intolerances and to support
work aimed at the promotion of substantive global equality.
The seventieth general debate takes place in the context of growing international concern about the rise of violent extremism, terrorism and untold brutality, which we strongly condemn. We welcome the meetings that will take place on the margins of the General Assembly to review the progress made in countering terrorism in the Middle East and North Africa.
We wish to emphasize that the Security Council must take into account the views of the African continent and its subregional organizations when dealing with conflicts in Africa in future. The current situation in Libya and the Sahel region is a direct consequence of the failure of some members of the Council to heed informed counsel from the African Union. The norm of responsibility to protect was abused for narrow political interests that had nothing to do with the fundamental aspects of the prevention of mass atrocities.
The current refugee crisis in Europe is, sadly, the direct result of the militarization of civilian unrest, which included the massive arming of civilians and opposition groups in Libya, Syria and other affected countries. That kind of problem is a deliberately man- made problem, and it is critical that, in discussing violent extremism and terrorism in parts of Africa and the Middle East, we look into the root causes of the problem and not just the symptoms. Also requiring our serious reflection is the regime change doctrine and its role in perpetuating conflicts and instability in various parts of our continent and the world.
We welcome the recently signed peace agreement between the parties in South Sudan and urge the United Nations and all stakeholders to support the Sudanese people as they work to resolve their challenges. We reaffirm our support for the people of Western Sahara and urge the international community to encourage their struggle for self-determination, freedom, human rights and dignity.
We also welcome the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States and the release of the Cuban Five. We reiterate our call for the lifting of the economic and financial embargo to help the Cuban people to gain their economic freedom. We acknowledge the contribution of His Holiness Pope Francis to the Cuban-United States normalization process. We also warmly welcome the contribution of the Holy Father generally to the global pursuit of
peace, justice and the end of poverty and suffering, as eloquently expressed in the General Assembly and globally.
We commend the United Nations for the key role that it has played in peacekeeping and urge that resources be prioritized for this core role of the United Nations, especially in Africa.
The failure of the parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reach an agreement at the 2015 Review Conference — in the year that marks 70 years since the first atomic bombs were detonated in Japan — is a major setback to our commitment to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons. There can be no safe hands where nuclear weapons are concerned. The humanitarian consequences of a possible detonation of a nuclear weapon, whether intentional or accidental, will be catastrophic for humankind.
We welcome the recent agreement reached on the Iranian nuclear programme and the recognition of the right of Iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
The seventieth session of the General Assembly has seen the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda. The outcome document represents a victory for the developing world, as it affirms that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) should build on the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals. Additionally, while the 2030 Agenda is universal in its scope in that the Sustainable Development Goals adopted apply to both developed and developing countries, there is also a clear recognition of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities. The Agenda also contains a specific Goal on achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. That is all the more appropriate given that this year is the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action and the fifteenth anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women, peace and security.
As the initiator of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action — thanks to which the current round of negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is taking place — South Africa has a special interest in and commitment to the success of the Paris session of the Conference of the Parties later this year. We require the fulfilment of all three parts of the Durban mandate,
namely, the closing of the current ambition gap in the pre-2020 period through the honouring of existing legal obligations by developed countries and enhanced action; the entry into force of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol; and the adoption in Paris of a new agreement for the post-2020 period that contains all the essential elements, including the means of implementation and the measures relating to loss, damage and response. We seek a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement in Paris that is applicable to all parties.
In addition, South Africa, as Chair of the G-77 plus China, would not be able to accept a Paris package that is hollow or weak on finance. South Africa has submitted its intended nationally determined contribution to the UNFCCC secretariat ahead of the 1 October deadline, signalling our readiness for Paris.
We join the world in celebrating the 70 years of existence of the United Nations. As we mark this historic anniversary, the reform of the Security Council and the strengthening of the General Assembly and other organs remain a paramount concern. By the end of this session, we should be in a position to adopt a road map, with clear and implementable time frames, on the priorities of this Organization as well as on its reform. We need to do this in order for the United Nations to remain a relevant force and a force for change in the world.
In conclusion, let me express our deep appreciation of the offer made by China when it was addressing the Assembly, an offer that must go through the United Nations. China spelled out the support it intended to give to Africa: a total of $100 million of free military assistance to the African Union over the next five years to support the establishment of the African Standby Force and the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises. We would like to underline our gratitude to China."
70,2015,UGA,"I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and assure you of Uganda’s support. We are confident that you will lead the Assembly effectively and successfully. I would also like to express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa for his leadership of the Assembly at its sixty- ninth session. I also pay tribute to the Secretary- General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his personal dedication and commitment to the work of the United Nations.
The theme for this session, “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”, is a very pertinent one. In the book of Matthew, Chapter 22, verses 37-38, the Bile tell us to “Love God with all your heart” and “Love your neighbour as you
love yourself”. Yesterday, while chairing the United Nations Summit on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), I quoted that portion of the Bible. Given the fact that the United Nations has been in existence for the past 70 years, one would have imagined that those fundamental rules of Christianity, which are also found in other religions, would have been clear to every member of the human family. Yet, unfortunately, that has not been the case.
Until recently, the human race has been divided between a small group of affluent and prosperous societies on the one hand and a large number of underdeveloped societies on the other. The underdeveloped societies have been in that condition partly because of endogenous factors and also partly because of exogenous factors. We do not have the time to lay out those two sets of factors that were responsible for that dichotomy in the human race between the developed and underdeveloped societies on the same planet in the same age.
Yet, as if by a miracle, during the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, the Member States finally agreed on the all-important SDGs — 17 of them. The convergence of analysis and solutions, of diagnosis and prescription, is a landmark in the history of humankind. It means that the international community now agrees with us in Uganda, we who have for long identified 10 strategic bottlenecks that have held Africa back from undergoing the necessary transformation to become first-world societies.
Unlike past prescriptions that entailed mainly philanthropy and aid and spoke of social goals without talking of economic goals, and so forth, the SDGs that we adopted the other day (see resolution 70/1) talk about industrialization and added value, trade, investments and human-resource development in addition to the previously proposed remedies. Above all, the SDGs proclaim in bold letters the concept of universal prosperity for all societies, for the first time in human history. While it is amazing that such enlightened self- interest has taken so long to dawn on all of us, the old saying that “better late than never” appropriately comes to mind in this case.
This convergence of diagnosis and prescription regarding global issues will, above all, assist in prioritizing the use of scarce resources, especially those under the control of international agencies. The tug-of-war as to what is more important, electricity or education, now comes to an end. It is clear that both, and more, are the sine qua non of socioeconomic transformation. Moreover, the use of the word “transformation” in the SDGs is most revealing. That is what we have been urging our partners to adopt instead of vague phrases like “sustainable development”.
Sustainable development without the resultant transformation is like talking of quantitative growth without qualitative change. We have been pointing out that that is not what happens in nature. The healthy quantitative expansion of, for instance, a foetus in the womb of the mother should always result, after a due period of time, into the foetus metamorphosing into a baby who now breathes through the nose and feeds through the mouth instead of relying on the umbilical cord.
Similarly, societies must grow not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. African societies, for instance, must grow from the pre-capitalist modes of production and from being producers of raw materials to middle-class and skilled working-class societies. I salute our own Honourable Sam Kutesa, who played a leading role in that historic effort at the level of the United Nations.
On the issue of global peace, our experience in Uganda has been to go back to the Bible, which teaches that whatever a man sows, that is what he reaps. If you sow the pseudo-ideology of sectarianism, bad governance, corruption, flunkeyism, and so forth, you will harvest insecurity and the stunted growth of the
State pillars, including the armed forces. Uganda is a country that has had a lot of problems, including losing 800,000 people between 1966 and 1986, who were killed extrajudicially by the various regimes.
We have never, however, appealed for external help in dealing with the security problems of our country. We have always emphasized building our own capacity at the earliest opportunity. That has served us well. Uganda today has capable security forces that have ushered in peace throughout the whole country, for the first time in the past 500 years.
Our advice to the United Nations system is therefore that, while it may be unavoidable to rely on external armies in dealing with particularly ugly situations, one should be wary of groups that seek external sponsorship instead of relying on their own internal energies and groups that seek to be puppets of external actors. Some very limited external solidarity may be necessary when oppressed people are fighting for survival and emancipation, if you are dealing with authentic patriotic groups.
However, the United Nations system will not add any value if it is lured into situations where it is supporting puppets who have no legitimacy in the various respective situations or who are pursuing one pseudo-ideology or another. In that case the United Nations becomes part of the problem, not part of the solution."
70,2015,KIR,"It is an honour and a privilege to address this historic seventieth session of the General Assembly on behalf of the President, the Government and the people of Kiribati. In Kiribati we begin all formal events such as this by conferring blessings on all. I therefore wish to begin by sharing with the Assembly all our traditional Kiribati blessing of peace and good health, “Kam na bane ni Mauri”.
I echo the sentiments conveyed by previous speakers in congratulating the President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session on his election and for presiding over the recently concluded historic Summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, held from 25 to 27 September. On his assumption of the presidency for the first year of the implementation the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), I wish to assure him of the full support and cooperation of Kiribati. Let me also take this opportunity to acknowledge with appreciation the commendable leadership of his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his stewardship over the past year as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and for guiding the massive task of shaping the recently adopted Agenda.
I also wish to commend the unwavering commitment and hard work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has served as an able navigator of our family ship, steering the United Nations through the diverse and complex realities and the myriad challenges facing our peoples and nations around the world. In particular, I wish to commend his sterling leadership in guiding the development of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, recently adopted by the membership, and his personal unwavering commitment to focusing
global attention on those who are most vulnerable and who are directly targeted by the many major challenges facing us today as a global community.
We meet at a critical time in the history of multilateralism. The global community very recently endorsed a new post-2015 development agenda “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. We are also celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. In two months, leaders from around the world will meet in Paris for the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to finalize an agreement on climate change. As we celebrate, we should also reflect on the needs of the most fragile and vulnerable peoples and ensure that the premier global Organization remains responsive to them. That will be the real litmus test for its relevance.
If we as a family of nations do not act, if we fail to focus on the challenges faced by those in the front line, whatever those challenges may be, then we would have failed the millions who are looking to the United Nations to assume leadership. I would like to reiterate our deepest appreciation to the Secretary-General for his demonstrated commitment and leadership in focusing the attention of the United Nations and the world on such issues as mitigating the plight of the most needy and alleviating poverty, addressing the Ebola pandemic, hearing the views of young people and women and enabling their participation in development, ending gender-based violence, achieving peace and security, and dealing with the question of climate change.
The challenges facing us as we gather again in New York for this historic session are perhaps greater than they were a year ago. Security challenges posed by climate change, conflicts, terrorism, cybercrime, transnational organized crime and the mass movement of refugees now seen in Europe are among the looming challenges that continue to undermine our efforts as a global family to achieve sustainable development, peace and security for our communities.
If we were to ask what the root causes of those major challenges were, we would be able to find many of the answers in the fact that too little attention has been paid to the problems addressed in the Goals recently endorsed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Goals are not new. Most, if not all, are in our national development plans and strategies.
15-29940 11/18

A/70/PV.27 02/10/2015
What is new is the global call for the international community to act together to do things differently in order to effect the transformational changes necessary to achieve the prosperous, peaceful, just and equitable societies that will benefit all. That is crucial in an increasingly interdependent world in which decisions made and actions taken in one country will have ripple effects elsewhere in the globe.
But in adopting the new Agenda, we must not leave undone the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Many countries, Kiribati included, do not have a strong scorecard with respect to the implementation of the MDGs, for a compelling reason. We, like all small island developing States, face major challenges in our development efforts, challenges which are well documented and which I will not repeat here. Those challenges are further compounded by climate change.
My people live on low-lying atoll islands that are no higher than 3 metres above sea level. With the changes in our climate system and with sea-level rise, our islands are now facing major challenges never before faced in our history. We have experienced climate extremes, not only from sea-level rise but also from disastrous natural events, such as cyclone Pam which hit Vanuatu and other low-lying Pacific islands, mine included, earlier this year, soon followed by typhoons Maysak and Dolphin.
High tides combined with strong winds wreaked havoc on our islands, our homes, our villages and our people. What is particularly alarming is the increasing frequency and severity of such events. In some parts of the country, whole villages have had to relocate because of severe coastal erosion and flooding. Food crops have been destroyed and the freshwater lakes, our major source of drinking water, are increasingly being contaminated by the intruding seawater. Our people are worried as they watch those events grow in intensity. The most vulnerable are the already vulnerable — women, children, the disabled, the sick and the aged.
All those events have put pressure on our already stressed national systems and limited national resources and will continue to do so. Kiribati and other low-lying atoll countries such as Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Maldives and Tokelau, as well as the millions of people living in coastal areas in the Pacific and around the globe, have first to address the critical and pressing here-and-now challenges from climate change, before
we can even begin to talk of sustainable development or a new development agenda.
The first real test of our commitment to the new development agenda adopted by the international community will be the Paris climate summit. The Sustainable Development Agenda will mean nothing if the Paris climate summit in December fails to come up with an ambitious and legally binding agreement that addresses the predicament of those on the front line of climate change and saves humankind by halting global warming. For us on the front line of climate change, the Paris outcome document must include a long-term temperature goal to limit global average temperature increase to below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It must also include provisions on loss and damage as a stand-alone element that is separate and distinct from adaptation.
We must all step up our national and collective efforts to mitigate global greenhouse-gas emissions. We must urge major greenhouse-gas emitters to do their part. Last week, my country, one of the countries with the lowest level of emissions, submitted an ambitious intended nationally determined contribution to the UNFCCC secretariat. We must call with urgency on our development partners, on philanthropic partners and on private businesses to assist us on the front line of the climate calamity to deal with the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise now being experienced in our countries and to support our efforts to build the resilience and preparedness of our people as they face an uncertain future. It is high time we recognize that the new challenges require us to draw on all the resources available to the global community and to accept that sustainable development and global challenges such as climate change should not be confined to the sphere of Governments alone.
Let us call on all those with the ability to assist and with a contribution to make to join in the global dialogue and, more important, to take part in urgent action to address this major challenge. Let us bring in our young people, our women, civil society, the private sector, churches, universities, traditional institutions and indigenous populations. Let us bring everyone on board. Let us be inclusive. Let all who have a contribution to make it.
We welcome the inclusive approach taken in developing the post-2015 development agenda. We also welcome the participation of Taiwan in the World
12/18 15-29940

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27
Health Assembly — for example, its inclusion in the fight against Ebola — and we would like to see a similar inclusive approach prevail in respect of other international institutions and United Nations processes in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and in the call for urgent climate action, where Taiwan and all who can participate and contribute meaningfully for the good of humankind must be brought in to do so. Everyone needs to be brought in.
“Business as usual” can no longer be our approach. Let us not confine ourselves to our comfort zones and our usual economic arguments; let us stop avoiding our political taboos. The challenge of climate change makes a larger demand on us. It requires that we rise above national priorities and think with a global consciousness. We must go outside the bounds of conventional thinking — outside the norm — because the challenge before us is extraordinarily serious and therefore calls for extraordinary and unconventional solutions.
It is most gratifying to note that there is an emerging glimmer of hope, that there is a shift in the wind in the dialogue on climate change. We welcome the opinion of His Holiness Pope Francis on climate change, together with the messages and expressions of commitment from a growing number of quarters, including capitals around the globe and civil society, in which climate change is recognized as posing a major challenge and requiring urgent action. We welcome this most gratifying shift as a very positive development in the right direction, implying that the international community has at last heard our messages and the stories we have shared about the plight of our people.
But hearing our story and recognizing that climate change is a major challenge is not enough; we need to act on it with urgency. We islands may be on the front line, but so are the millions of people around the world living in low-lying areas. They are just as vulnerable. So are the millions of others facing prolonged droughts, higher temperatures and melting glaciers. For them, like us, sustainable development and the recently adopted new Agenda will not mean anything, unless the global community steps up, and steps up substantially, its efforts to combat climate change.
We take full responsibility for the future of our people and we will do our part. In Kiribati, we have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to ensure the survival of our people. We have bought land offshore. We have
looked at floating and artificial islands and options for raising our islands from their current heights to heights above the predicted sea-level rises. We have embarked on a major education reform programme designed to upgrade the skills of our people in line with our programme on migration with dignity.
But we cannot do it alone. There needs to be a collective global effort. We call for new and accessible financial resources to assist the most vulnerable to adapt and build resilience to climate change. We welcome the continued assistance of our partners, including Taiwan, but much, much more needs to be done. While it is commendable that there have been significant pledges for the Green Climate Fund, there remain the challenge of accessibility and the translation of these pledges into contributions where they matter the most. We welcome the assistance provided by various agencies with the capacity to provide the needed conduit, but it is equally important that such assistance not get eroded in the process.
In celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the united family of nations, we must have confidence that, as we pledge in the preamble to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, no member nation will be left behind. It is simply not sufficient to acknowledge that climate change is an existential challenge. It is about our response as the global community and what actions we take as a community of moral human beings.
I reiterate that the real test of the effectiveness and relevance of the new Sustainable Development Agenda, and indeed the relevance of the united family of nations as it celebrates its seventieth anniversary, is in ensuring that no one is left behind. Yet my people and those on the front line of climate change face the real possibility of being left behind. I therefore call on the General Assembly to lend its support to the voice of the most vulnerable and call on the international community to craft an ambitious legally binding agreement that can begin to heal our one shared home and planet. I further call on the General Assembly to join those on the front line of climate change in requesting the Conference of the Parties in Paris to agree that the increase in global average temperature should be held below 2°C or 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The climate agreement must also include provisions on loss and damage and, most important, a special mechanism to fast-track urgent assistance to the millions of people who are at the front line of climate change and who need that assistance immediately.
"
70,2015,ALB,"One year ago, Pope Francis began his visits around Europe in Albania. Last week, we saw here in America the hope and joy he could bring to the richest and most powerful country in the world. Imagine the joy he brought to us, not least by the praise he bestowed on Albania in saying that we were proof that a peaceful and fruitful coexistence between persons and communities of believers of different religions is not only desirable, but possible and realistic. We are rightly proud of that heritage; of coexisting as fraternal communities at a time when religious extremism, violence and terrorism are causing unspeakable suffering — violence and extremism that have put multitudes of people on the move in scenes reminiscent of the exodus of biblical times, with children, women and men arriving in their thousands on our doorsteps in the Balkans as they seek safety and protection in Europe.
As everyone here probably knows, ethnically motivated conflicts and violence are by no means unknown to us in the Balkans. Today, however, we as a region can finally dare to look ahead with hope and show that another way forward is possible.
Last year, for the first time after 100 years of frozen or live conflicts and confrontation in the Balkans, no guns were pointed at anyone’s window. After a century scarred by conflict, we have finally seen a year of cooperation aimed at making the peace we have achieved a peace worth living.
The talks between Serbia and Kosovo, a new State contributing to stability in the region, have enabled the two countries to find common solutions to a series of issues, for the good of their peoples. And here I would like to call on all those in this Hall that have not yet recognized Kosovo to do so, and by so doing to make a straightforward contribution to strengthening stability,
peace and cooperation in a region that last year became a significant success story, a region in which hopes and dreams for the future are prevailing over the fears and nightmares of the past. Full recognition of Kosovo by every nation in this Assembly will be good for Serbia as well.
Moreover, last year I made the first visit of an Albanian Prime Minister to Belgrade in 68 years. And since the Western Balkans Summit, held in Vienna in August, our region has been successfully collaborating in a number of areas, including youth exchanges promoted by Albania and Serbia and inspired by the model of youth exchanges between France and Germany after the Second World War. We are focusing on this in particular because it is crucial for our young people to be aware of what history has taught us: that it is better to celebrate our differences than to fight over them and to learn from our past than to live in it, no matter the place, no matter the language, no matter the colour and no matter the religion.
In an unprecedented approach, the United Nations has engaged in conversation with hundreds and thousands of young people. In developing the Sustainable Development Goals, it has taken into account their hopes and expectations. As we affirm our pledge to achieve these Goals, let us focus our attention on the young. Let us — countries large and small — come together to begin the process of developing a global charter that puts the education of our young and our determination to give them a better future at its heart. We are going to introduce a reform in Albania that will include in the school curriculum such a charter of values. We have also been working hard to make progress on important reforms in a number of areas, including education, public administration, energy, economic development, justice and the fight against crime.
Albania is eager to be part of the global team that will meet this December in Paris to decide on measures to protect the environment in line with the objectives of sustainable development and the purposes to be served by the intended nationally determined contributions. This unprecedented event will be effective if we act as a great team and all play their parts. Yet, in an era beset by enormous challenges like climate change, violent extremism, poverty, inequality, corruption and illicit trafficking, first and foremost let us ensure the future by teaching young people the values of tolerance, respect
20/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
and understanding no matter the place, the language, the colour or the religion.
I was an artist before being elected to political office. Every day I still like to pick up a pencil or a pen or a paintbrush, even for a few minutes, and draw, doodle or paint. All of us are trying to paint our own big picture in our different ways, to set out a clear vision and to work towards it.
If the world were a painting, today it would probably be more grey than black or white. There are few certainties. And many splashes of glaring and harsh colours would warn us of the many dangers and threats we face. But here in this place, there are values and principles that we can apply to all the challenges in the world, and we need them now more than ever. At a time of tragic events, with the sounds of war around him, Winston Churchill noted: “Words are the only things that last forever.” Let us all depict in words in our school curricula these values and principles of tolerance and respect for the diversity of faiths, identities, cultures, histories and beliefs, thereby recognizing the common humanity that we all share.
Obviously, global principles and values of tolerance, written in black on the white paper of a global charter, cannot wipe out violent extremism, hatred, stereotypes, discrimination and the scars they have caused. Yet these values, when they are put into words and taught in our schools, can bridge differences and inspire hearts and minds to take common action and usher in a better future for our world. The hearts and minds of our young people represent the best insurance for a better future. If we show them the right path, they will take it.
Let us also try to be a better team and demonstrate, first and foremost, that we — men and women, individuals and peoples — are joined together by our common humanity and must work together to build a common and sustainable future for all, no matter the place, no matter the language, no matter the colour and no matter the religion.
"
70,2015,DZA,"On behalf of Algeria, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I would also like express my thanks and gratitude to Mr. Sam Kutesa, the Assembly’s President at its previous session, for the many achievements realized during his presidency, which we hope to build on and strengthen.
The current session coincides with the commemoration of the seventieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations. It is taking place at a time when the international community is facing multiple challenges and opportunities that are the result of seven decades of profound changes and collective efforts, which have had their share of both successes and failures. Peace and stability have been restored in many parts of the world that were once ravaged by destructive wars; people have liberated themselves from the yoke of colonialism in Africa, Asia and Latin America; and the world has seen a qualitative leap
forward and significant development in the past seven decades.
That situation is in sharp contrast to the colonialism and foreign occupation that persist in some regions, along with the worsening poverty and hunger that remain the biggest challenge for the United Nations today. There are also new threats posed by terrorism, organized crime, drug trafficking and human trafficking. In this context, I would be remiss if I failed to mention the images that the media have brought us of the massive influx of refugees into Europe as a result of the war- and crisis-induced humanitarian tragedies that unquestionably denote a collective failure to deal with conflicts and their consequences in several regions, particularly the Middle East.
The outcome document of the Summit on the post-2015 development agenda (resolution 70/1), held a few days ago, has both confirmed that failure and at the same time renewed the universal commitment to tackling the challenges facing humankind on the economic, social, security and environmental fronts, above all the need to unite our efforts to fight poverty and take new approaches to advancing development and improving the living conditions of people, who should be the focus of those efforts. At the same time, scarce natural resources must be safeguarded and the environment protected.
From this rostrum and at this pivotal meeting, Algeria once again affirms the validity of the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and renews its commitment to continuing to work to ensure the triumph of the values that unite us and that have made the United Nations a mirror of the concerns of the peoples of the world, their ambitions and hopes.
I would like to stress once again the need to continue United Nations reform, adapting its mechanisms and modernizing its tools, to enable it to fulfil its mission more efficiently. It is a question, on the one hand, of reaffirming the central role of the General Assembly as the conceiver and mouthpiece of international cooperation for development and the implementation of its resolutions and approaches, and, on the other hand, of the necessary reform of the Security Council dictated by the new challenges and threats to international peace and security. This principal organ no longer mirrors the composition of the international community, particularly the African continent.

Algeria is participating in this historic session having achieved, before the deadline, most of the Millennium Development Goals adopted at the 2000 Summit. Under the programme of the President of the Republic, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Algeria has implemented an ambitious development policy and development plans whose purpose is to relaunch the economic growth and to provide for the social needs of all citizens, while continuing to strengthen the rule of law, independence of the judiciary, freedom of expression and equal opportunity for men and women.
Because of its central location in the Maghreb and Sahel areas and guided by the principles of its foreign policy, Algeria has continued to work for peace, security and harmony in its immediate neighbourhood and to bring political and economic support to its neighbours so as to strengthen Maghreb and African integration, convinced that this is an investment for the future of all and for the establishment of peace and stability at the regional and international levels. That is reflected in the steady approach of the international mediation team in Mali, led by Algeria, that resulted in the conclusion of a comprehensive agreement for peace and national reconciliation. We encourage all parties signatory to this agreement, and more generally, all political and social forces in Mali, and we invite the international community, particularly donor countries, to endorse this process and to back it politically and financially in an ongoing manner.
Algeria, which has stood by the fraternal Libyan people since the outbreak of the crisis in that neighbouring country, spares no effort to help it restore peace and stability and maintain its national unity. Algeria renews its support for the efforts of the United Nations in Libya to achieve an inclusive, comprehensive solution that involves all stakeholders in Libya with a view to immediately creating a Government of national accord.
In that regard, the efforts of the African Union in conflict resolution and peacekeeping in Africa are noteworthy. Indeed, the African Union has several achievements to its credit, with the continent contributing over 45 per cent of the world’s peacekeeping personnel. I would recall that the latest African summit, held in Johannesburg, took important decisions reflecting the will of the countries and peoples of the continent to work towards finding African solutions to African problems.
In Western Sahara, after a quarter century of ceasefire between the two parties to the conflict, the Kingdom of Morocco and the Frente Polisario, and the adoption of the United Nations-African Settlement Plan, the Saharan people continue to live under occupation and the resultant suffering. Procrastination and attempts to flee responsibilities are ongoing and have prevented the achievement of a solution to this conflict, thereby undermining the credibility of the United Nations.
Algeria, which supports with conviction and firmness the right of the Saharan people to determine their destiny in complete freedom, appreciates the sustained efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy, Mr. Christopher Ross. We call on the United Nations to set a firm date for the holding of a referendum in accordance with relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, as was expressly requested by the African Summit in June 2015. Algeria will spare no effort to assist the parties to the conflict and the United Nations, with a view to an early implementation of the solution for which the fraternal Saharan people and other peoples of the Maghreb have been insistently calling.
With this same conviction of the necessity for settling disputes by peaceful means, Algeria has been following with great attention and concern the developments of the situations in Syria and Yemen, and the suffering of the two fraternal peoples in those two countries. Algeria therefore urges the protagonists to commit resolutely to the search for a peaceful solution to the crises in their countries. There is no other solution.
Algeria notes with satisfaction the growing global awareness of the need to fight international terrorism and to address its root causes and repercussions. That is why Algeria calls for comprehensive approaches to fighting transnational organized crime, including human trafficking and drug trafficking. We call for drying up the sources of funding for terrorist groups, especially by prohibiting and criminalizing the payment of ransoms. In this context, Algeria recently organized an international conference on deradicalization, whose recommendations stressed the need to promote the values of tolerance and moderation.
Algeria, which paid a heavy price to regain its sovereignty and rejoin the community of nations, understands the true value of the heroic struggle of the Palestinian people to recover their national rights
15-29658 47/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
and shares their hopes as the Palestinian flag is now flying at Headquarters for the first time. This symbolic victory, which came after the international recognition of the Palestinian State, supports a just and definitive solution to the Palestinian issue designed to ensure the creation of a sovereign State, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Given the importance of the issue of climate change and its impact in the economic, social and environmental spheres, and even in political and security concerns, we express the hope that the outcome of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held soon in Paris, will meet the ecological challenges that now threaten to make countries and entire regions disappear and that seriously jeopardize life on Earth.
I must also say that we need to admit that in spite of the achievements we have accomplished together at the United Nations and beyond, the instruments and procedures set up by the founding fathers seven decades ago no longer meet the requirements of the day, nor the aspirations of the world’s population, which now exceeds 7 billion people. In other words, the new and multiple challenges generated by globalization and the profound changes and transformations that have affected international relations for decades demand that we make bold reforms capable of conferring the credibility and transparency needed by the multilateral system of cooperation.
The commemoration of the anniversaries of institutions, like people’s birthdays, are ideal opportunities for introspective assessments and forward-looking projections. Therefore, we harken back to the historic results of the twenty-ninth session of our Assembly, held in 1974 under the presidency of Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, on South Africa, Palestine and the new international economic order, to express the hope that the current session will derive inspiration from that memorable time in our Organization’s life and will rise to meet the current challenges with a qualitative, collective and courageous leap forward to promote a humankind at peace with itself and free from fear and want.
"
70,2015,TKM,"It gives me great pleasure to join previous speakers in warmly congratulating Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and to wish him success. Allow me also to express my appreciation to Mr. Sam Kutesa for the tremendous work that he carried out as President of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I also congratulate the United Nations and all delegations on the seventieth anniversary and wish our Organization continued success, universal recognition and respect.
In its approach to the major themes of the current session, Turkmenistan believes there is a need to take concrete and targeted measures aimed at supporting States and regions where, for various reasons, the issues of sustainable development are particularly acute.
With regard to Central Asia, there is currently discussion about the creation of the conditions enabling its successful integration into modern global processes and its rebirth as a region that provides a stable and strong link in intercontinental partnerships. I am convinced that that is an achievable goal, if we can ensure peace, tranquillity and security, which are key factors for the development, progress and prosperity of the Central Asian States. That has been the focus of Turkmenistan’s major efforts and the projects and initiatives that it is carrying out, which it invites the international community, represented by the United Nations, to join.
One of the projects is the idea of establishing a United Nations regional centre in Central Asia for technology related to climate change. The large-scale environmental problems that exist in that region are, I think, well known. They directly or indirectly affect the overall atmosphere in the region, as well as the standard of living and the quality of life of the inhabitants, and sometimes have a negative impact on relations between States. Under those conditions, it is becoming clear that there is a need for a specialized international body that would be able, with a United Nations mandate, to carry out monitoring and an objective analysis of the environmental processes and trends occurring there and, on that basis, be able to issue relevant recommendations to the Governments of the Central Asian States. The vision for the functions and directions of the activities of such a centre already exist. Turkmenistan is ready to
provide all the necessary infrastructure for the centre in Turkmenistan and to ensure the most favourable conditions for its staff. I therefore call for an in-depth consideration of our proposal on the creation of a United Nations regional centre for technology related to climate change in Central Asia.
The achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in the region will not be possible without the participation of our closest neighbour, Afghanistan. The brotherly Afghan people and Government are today particularly in need of the political and moral support of the international community. They also need real, tangible economic assistance. Time has shown that the resolution of the situation in Afghanistan is possible only through peaceful, political means on the basis of a broad national dialogue with the participation of all responsible and constructive forces representing the Afghan people. Moreover, we are convinced that the process of reconciliation must be accompanied by effective international economic assistance, targeted measures aimed at creating social infrastructure and humanitarian assistance.
We believe that the most important factor in the stability, progress and prosperity of Afghanistan is the integration of the country into regional and international energy and transportation projects. Projects such as the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India Pipeline and the railway from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan are designed to ensure economic growth and the creation of new jobs in Afghanistan and favourable conditions for foreign investment. Not least important, their implementation will have a significant stabilizing effect on the political climate in Afghanistan itself, as well as on the surrounding area. It will also restore the Afghan people’s confidence in their own strength and capacity to build a modern, stable and dynamic State, one that is an equal and like-minded partner with neighbouring countries and the entire international community. As an initiator and participant in those international projects, Turkmenistan will continue to provide assistance to Afghanistan at the bilateral level for the construction of economic and social facilities, as well as to supply energy at a discounted rate and to provide training for Afghan professionals in our educational institutions.
In the context of Afghanistan’s restoration, the support provided to both developing and the least developed countries, on which the effectiveness of today’s entire system of international relations depends, is of over-arching importance. Therefore,
15-29940 7/18

A/70/PV.27 02/10/2015
for Turkmenistan, the main goal and essence of post- 2015 sustainable development should be to overcome the serious — and I would even say borderline dangerous — imbalance between States, regions and entire continents, in terms of industry, the economy, technology and the environment, as well as with respect to people’s quality of life and in the areas of health care, education and in the standards and structures of food systems. It is obvious that humanitarian assistance alone, as well as supplies of medicine and provisions, along with one-time financial infusions by the United Nations and individual States, while extremely important, will not solve the problem.
Today, there is a need for a long-term, in-depth and well thought-out strategy for support for developing and the least developed countries that includes a wide range of political, legal, economic, social and investment measures. An action-oriented and coordinating role should be played here by the United Nations, in particular its Economic and Social Council and the United Nations Development Programme, as well as other specialized agencies. A more important factor for such support is, in our view, the participation of such countries in international economic projects, in particular in the area of the transport of energy to global markets, as well as the creation of transport corridors between regions and across continents.
Turkmen initiatives for the development of such sectors of the global economy have received unanimous approval from the General Assembly through the adoption of relevant resolutions. We expect meaningful follow-up through their implementation. I would also like to emphasize the readiness of our country to both continue and strengthen cooperation with the World Health Organization, the United Nations World Food Programme, the United Nations Population Fund and other entities.
The current session should provide us with clear guidelines for the future. It is natural and appropriate that it is the United Nations, the international entity with a universal mandate, that will act as the leader in promoting and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The tremendous potential of the United Nations, which has been acquired over seven decades of unique experience of dealing with the challenges and threats and providing solutions for many global problems, proves that only together, by joining forces, will it be possible for us to achieve the goals we have set, no matter how difficult they may be.
Turkmenistan believes that today, within these walls, significant momentum will be given to our forward movement and to the new, more humane and more just world order. Together with the family of nations we are prepared to participate in that work.
"
70,2015,NOR,"The United Nations is now 70 years old. At the start of the meeting in San Francisco where the United Nations Charter was drafted, President Truman said “You members of this conference are to be architects of the better world. In your hands rests our future.” And he was right. The United Nations Charter has served humanity well for 70 years. Despite many challenges, there have been important milestones: decolonization, the establishment of the universal human rights system, the Millennium Development Goals, and a reduction in the number of inter-State wars.
15-29562 41/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
Unfortunately, as we celebrate these 70 years, the forces of disorder, discrimination, violence and disruption are on the rise again. International law, universal norms and human rights are being violated by States and non-State actors alike. One of the consequences is the massive refugee crisis that we are seeing, with 60 million refugees and displaced people.
All States benefit from a global legal order where right prevails over might. One of the most important rules of the new world order created in 1945 is respect for internationally recognized borders. This basic principle has been blatantly violated in Europe during the last couple of years, and Europe’s security landscape has been changed. We must return to a situation where all States abide by their obligations under international law.
The four most serious humanitarian crises in the world are, in fact, political crises. Power hungry politicians, armed groups and military leaders have ignored the plight of their peoples in the countries concerned: South Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Iraq. When State authorities ignore the rule of law or fail to live up to their human rights obligations, the result is often conflict and chaos. The regional and global consequences of these crises are far-reaching.
During the course of 2015, the United Nations has been carrying out three important reviews of peace operations, of the peacebuilding architecture and of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). These reviews will be important tools for improving our work on peace, security, human rights, mediation and conflict prevention. We must ensure that the United Nations has the funding and the political backing to prevent political exclusion and poor governance. Then we will be better able to prevent armed conflict and the resulting humanitarian crises.
The permanent members of the Security Council have a particular responsibility. Norway urges all States to join the proposed code of conduct to enable the Security Council to act decisively against mass atrocities. We support the French initiative to suspend the use of veto in such situations. We will also step up our efforts to support United Nations peacekeeping and the capacity of the United Nations to prevent conflict.
The flow of arms to conflict areas and the lack of protection for civilians further increase human suffering. The Arms Trade Treaty, with its humanitarian goals, gives us an important tool for addressing these
problems. The Secretary-General has called on all parties to conflict to refrain from using explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas. We support his call.
At the Oslo Conference on Safe Schools, we endorsed the Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict. Some 49 countries have already endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration. They have committed themselves to protecting education from attack in conflict situations. We urge other countries to come on board.
We see progress in Iraq, and we have hope for South Sudan. Norway is committed to supporting the transitional arrangements to help South Sudan out of its self-destructive conflict. The crisis in Syria started with peaceful protests calling for freedom. These were met with a violent crackdown. Upholding human rights is one of the fundamental obligations of any Government. The exodus from Syria today is a direct consequence of the violence unleashed by the Government.
The conflict in Syria has also allowed extremist terror groups like the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to gain a foothold. Now, both the Government and non-State groups such as ISIL and the Al-Nusra Front are committing monstrous atrocities. The spread of these extremist groups needs to be stopped.
Norway will adhere to global norms in its response to the crisis. We are receiving refugees at our borders in line with the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 and our international human rights obligations. We have agreed to take in a high number of refugees from Syria’s neighbouring countries for resettlement under United Nations quotas. We are taking part in the rescue efforts in the Mediterranean. We have already doubled our humanitarian aid to Syria and the region this year and we will increase our aid further. We will be hosting a donor conference in cooperation with Germany and the United Nations.
When leaders fail to shoulder their most basic responsibilities, the international community must make use of the tools the United Nations has at its disposal. The United Nations has established many global standards. Fifteen years ago, the Security Council adopted resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. It is a landmark resolution, but its implementation is taking too long. In several war- ravaged towns in Syria, groups of women are calling for a ceasefire and evacuation. They do this at great
42/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
personal risk. Their bravery should inspire us. We must intensify the implementation of the Security Council resolutions on women and peace and security.
Seventy years ago, we set out to eradicate extremism. The fight against extremism must be maintained, also in our countries. Extremism is once again raising its head in different shapes and forms. The ideology of disorder, discrimination, violence and disruption dominates the ideologies of ISIL, Al-Qaida and their various affiliates. International cooperation at all levels is essential. In June, Norway hosted a European conference on countering violent extremism, where a European youth network was launched. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy will remain a cornerstone of our efforts. We also welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative in developing a new United Nations plan of action for this issue, and I would like to highlight the importance of including girls and women in the planning and implementation of efforts to counter violent extremism.
The recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals are another example of the important role the United Nations continues to play. We know that health and education are fundamental to inclusive growth and jobs. Ebola was a wake-up call for us all. Education is also crucial in resolving conflicts and rebuilding societies. However, we need to address the considerable financial gap in the field of education. A first step is the International Commission on the Financing of Global Education Opportunities, announced at the recent Oslo Summit on Education for Development. Norway will double its investment in education for the period from 2014 to 2017. But sustainable development is not possible without respect for human rights. It is therefore vital to ensure that the human rights pillar of the United Nations is strong and assertive. If we do not provide adequate funding for human rights efforts, we will not be able to achieve the results we want and need.
The United Nations should not be seen as a costly burden; it provides win-win solutions for all Member States. I would like to highlight two areas where that is particularly clear. First, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has been called the constitution of the oceans. It provides a clear framework for all activities in oceans and seas. It regulates the rights and duties of various States. And it should be used to the full in order to help to decrease tensions, prevent conflict and find peaceful solutions. Secondly, climate change is a fact. The Climate Summit to be held in
Paris later this year is our opportunity to shoulder our responsibilities and take action. We, the Member States, must grasp that opportunity for the sake of our future as nations and as a global community.
We can be the generation that defeats extreme poverty. We can be the generation that prevents political crises from becoming humanitarian crises. We are already the first generation to experience human- made climate change. Let us also be the generation that halts climate change. And we can be the generation that finally realizes the right to education for all. With the Charter of the United Nations as our starting point, we must adapt our global norms to address new challenges. The forces of disorder, discrimination, violence and disruption must be stopped. The United Nations is a crucial arena for developing shared measures to address shared threats. We must use it to the full if we are to meet the threats we are facing today, from climate change to terrorism. We can thus ensure that the United Nations continues to serve humanity well for the next 70 years. Its Member States can still be, in Truman’s words, the architects of a better world.
"
70,2015,VNM,"On behalf of the Vietnamese delegation, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr. Lykketoft upon his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I believe that, with his wisdom and experience, he will guide our session to a very successful outcome. My delegation also applauds the important contributions made by Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the sixty-ninth session, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, during the past year.
Born from the ashes of the Second World War, the United Nations has grown, during the past seven decades, to embrace 193 States and has become the most representative global organization and the true centre for the coordination of global efforts to tackle common challenges. As a beacon of hope, the United Nations has indeed helped make the world a better place by playing an increasingly important role in maintaining peace and security, in protecting and promoting human rights and in advancing development and progress.
Guided by its Charter, the United Nations has worked to uphold the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations. The Organization has promoted the non-use of force or of threats to use force in inter-State relations and had provided guidance for peaceful and amicable relations among nations, underlining, in particular, the importance of mutual respect, good faith and the peaceful settlement of disputes. It is in that spirit that we welcome the recent progress made in addressing the Iranian nuclear issue, which is a first step towards a long-term solution that could bring peace, security and stability to the broader region. We also welcome the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba and call for the timely lifting of the embargoes currently imposed upon the brotherly Cuban people.
We can all look back on the past 70 years and the accomplishments of the United Nations with pride, but we must also recognize what the Organization has been unable to do and what challenges lie ahead. Wars and conflicts have not been uncommon during the past decades and still rage today. Terrorism, violent extremism, and religious and ethnic intolerance pose serious threats to regional and international peace and security. Territorial and maritime disputes endanger peace and stability in many regions. Threats to the very survival of humankind persist. Nuclear weapons arsenals, though reduced, are still capable of destroying our home planet many times over. Climate change is threatening the livelihoods of billions of people
and even the existence of many countries. Poverty remains one of the greatest challenges to sustainable development. Violence, discrimination, social injustice and humanitarian crises plague everyone’s enjoyment of their human rights.
Immense challenges require equally immense efforts, and the United Nations must continue to play a central role in those endeavours. Viet Nam welcomes the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which sets the vision and creates the framework for all nations as they strive to eliminate hunger and poverty, develop more sustainable patterns of production and consumption and work for the improved preservation of our shared planet, which is faced with the threats of climate change and over- consumption. The full and effective implementation of the new Agenda, with a global partnership at its core, will address the deep-rooted causes of our present problems and guide the world towards a more sustainable future.
In order to transform our world, the United Nations needs to transform itself. The work of the General Assembly needs to be revitalized so as to make it more focused, efficient and relevant. The Security Council needs to be more representative, democratic, transparent and effective. The United Nations development system needs to be strengthened. Institutional reforms must go alongside substantive innovations, while ensuring a balance among various aspects of the United Nations work. Our experience with the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals has shown that peace and stability are the prerequisites for sustainable development. In the words of the 2030 Agenda,
“Sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security, and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development” (resolution 70/1, para. 35).
It is therefore incumbent upon each and every State and the United Nations to do their utmost to ensure peace and security at the national, regional and international levels. Each State needs to act responsibly in accordance with the basic principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Regional and international organizations, with the United Nations in the lead, also need to act accordingly and assist the States concerned to find amicable solutions to their differences and disputes by peaceful means, as provided for in the Charter. Only by doing so, can we
15-29940 5/18

A/70/PV.27 02/10/2015
hope for a future free from violence, the threat or use of force, intimidation, coercion and inequities, which would create an enabling environment for our common development. At the same time, in order to succeed, sustainable development must truly be of the people, by the people and for the people. In other words, the people must be at the centre of the new Agenda, as the owners, drivers and beneficiaries of all development efforts.
And no agenda can succeed without a strong global partnership for sustainable development. Viet Nam has always believed that domestic resources play the decisive role in the development of any nation, but we also believe that no individual country can do it alone. We call on the developed countries to take the lead in assisting developing countries in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, especially in the fields of financing, technology transfer and human resources development. We also support and participate in South-South cooperation activities, which, we believe, provide an effective channel for sharing experience, technical support and capacity-building.
Like the United Nations, Viet Nam is celebrating the seventieth anniversary of its founding this year. Immediately after regaining its independence after nearly a century of colonialism, Viet Nam associated itself with the principles and values of the Charter of the United Nations. Our late President Ho Chi Minh, the founder of modern Viet Nam, wrote on several occasions to world leaders to request recognition of the new Viet Nam and its admission to the United Nations. And, since becoming a Member of the United Nation in 1977, Viet Nam has always done its best to uphold the principles and purposes of the Charter and contribute constructively and responsibly to the work of the Organization.
Viet Nam has always put people at the centre of all development strategies. Comprehensive human development encompasses physical and mental well- being, including human rights. Viet Nam has introduced laws and policies to ensure that all of the human rights of its people, including economic, social, civil and political rights, are respected, protected and promoted. Viet Nam is today party to seven out of the nine core international human rights treaties. It has most recently joined the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Viet Nam is strongly committed to the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. At the national level, we will mobilize all available resources, engage all relevant Government agencies and other stakeholders, and involve the people and their communities in that major undertaking. Viet Nam pledges its support for the conclusion of a meaningful agreement at the upcoming meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris. For its part, Viet Nam has recently submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions.
At the regional level, we have joined efforts with our brothers and sisters of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to work towards strengthening the ASEAN community. As an integral part of the dynamically growing Asia-Pacific region, ASEAN plays a crucial role in regional development. But for our region to thrive, peace and stability must come first. It is therefore of vital importance that peace and stability be maintained and that maritime safety and security and the freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea be secured. Viet Nam is working tirelessly with other ASEAN members and all parties concerned to that end, including by calling upon all parties to refrain from the threat or use of force and to settle all disputes by peaceful means in accordance with international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We are also engaging with partners to ensure the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and to work for the early conclusion of a code of conduct.
At the international level, Viet Nam is prepared to further its active contributions to world peace and security and the well-being of all. That is why we are stepping up our participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations and have put forward our candidatures for the Economic and Social Council for 2016-2018, the UNESCO Executive Board for 2015- 2019 and the Security Council for 2020-2021. We look forward to receiving Members’ continued support.
To free our people from fear and want and to leave no one behind, let us all join our actions on this path towards a better and more sustainable future. Let the Charter of the United Nations be our source of inspiration and the 2030 Agenda be our guide in building a world of peace, security and prosperity for our people and succeeding generations.
"
70,2015,BRA,"It is a privilege to address the General Assembly this year as the United Nations celebrates its seventieth birthday.
My first remarks are to congratulate you, Mr. President, on having been chosen to preside over the Assembly. I reiterate, in particular, Brazil’s support for your willingness to put in place measures that will ultimately strengthen the Organization’s development agenda.
Seventy years have passed since the San Francisco Conference. On that occasion, the international community sought to build a world founded on international law and on the pursuit of the peaceful resolution of conf licts. Since then, we have seen progress and setbacks. The decolonization process has evolved remarkably, as can be seen from the composition of the Assembly.
The United Nations has since expanded its initiatives and incorporated into the development agenda the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In other words, it is addressing issues related to the environment, poverty eradication, social and economic development and access to quality services, while issues related to urban life, gender, women and children, and race have all gained priority on the agenda.
However, the Organization has not achieved the same success in addressing collective security challenges, even though they were at the origin of the Organization and at the centre of its concerns. The proliferation of regional conflicts, some of which have the potential to be highly destructive, and the spread of terrorism, which kills men, women and children, destroys our common heritage and displaces millions of people from their long-established communities, demonstrate all too well that the United Nations is currently being severely tested. One cannot be complacent in the face of barbaric acts such as those perpetrated by the so- called Islamic State and other associated groups. The situation today explains, to a large extent, the refugee crisis currently facing humankind.
A substantial proportion of the men, women and children who desperately brave the waters of the Mediterranean and wearily make their way along the roads of Europe come from the Middle East and North Africa, from countries whose State institutions have been dismantled by military actions undertaken in contravention of international law, thereby opening space for the proliferation of terrorism. The deep sense of indignation caused by the picture of a dead Syrian boy on the beaches of Turkey and by the news of the 71 persons asphyxiated inside a truck in Austria should be translated into unmistakable acts of practical solidarity.
In a world where goods, capital, information and ideas flow freely, it is absurd to prevent the free flow of people. Brazil is a host country, a welcoming country, one that is made up of people from around the world. We have received Syrians, Haitians, men and women, just as we have provided shelter for more than a century to millions of Europeans, Arabs and Asians. We are an open society. We welcome refugees. We are a multi-ethnic country, where differences coexist. We know all too well the importance of differences, which ultimately make us stronger, richer and more diverse culturally, socially and economically.
The disquieting backdrop I have just described demands that we reflect on the future of the United Nations and requires that we act resolutely and quickly. We need a United Nations that is capable of promoting lasting international peace and of acting swiftly and effectively during crises, regional and localized conflicts and in response to any crimes against humanity. We can no longer delay, for example, the creation of a Palestinian State that coexists peacefully and harmoniously with Israel. Similarly, the expansion of settlements in the occupied territories cannot be tolerated.
In order to give the United Nations the central role it is rightfully entitled to, a comprehensive reform of its structures must be carried out. The Security Council must be expanded in its permanent and non-permanent member categories in order to become more representative, legitimate and effective. Most Member States do not want a decision on this matter to be postponed forever. We hope that the current session will enter into history as a turning point in the trajectory of the United Nations and that it will yield concrete results in the long, and so far inconclusive, reform process of the Organization.
In our region of the world — where peace and democracy reign — we welcome the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States of America, which puts an end to a dispute stemming back to the Cold War. We hope that this process will be completed with the end of the embargo currently imposed on Cuba. We also celebrate the recent agreement reached with Iran, which will enable that country to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and to restore the hope of peace to an entire region. Together, the countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa have launched a new development bank, which will assist in expanding trade and investment and will also possibly help to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) outlines the future we want. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals reaffirm the basic tenet of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, that is, it is possible to grow, include, preserve and protect. They establish universal targets and stress the need for cooperation among people and a shared path for humankind. The 2030 Agenda requires global solidarity, determination from each one of us and a commitment to tackling climate change, overcoming extreme poverty and creating opportunities for all.
In Paris, next December, we must strengthen the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by ensuring that its provisions are fulfilled and its principles respected. The obligations we take on in Paris should be ambitious in scope and nature and should include financial and technological support to developing countries and small island States, in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.
Brazil is making a substantial effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without jeopardizing its development. We continue to diversify the renewable sources in our energy mix, which is among the cleanest in the world. We are also currently investing in low- carbon agriculture. We have reduced deforestation in the Amazonian region by 82 per cent. A sense of ambition will continue to guide our actions. In this spirit, I announced yesterday at the United Nations Brazil’s intended nationally determined contribution, which is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent by 2030, with 2005 as the baseline year. During this period, Brazil intends to put an end to illegal deforestation and to reforest 12 million hectares,
to recover 15 million hectares of degraded pasture lands and to integrate 5 million hectares of crop, livestock and forest.
In a world where the share of renewable energy accounts for only 13 per cent on average of the overall energy mix worldwide, we intend to derive 45 per cent of our domestic energy mix from renewable sources. To that end, we will pursue a share of 66 per cent for hydropower in our electricity generation output and a share of 23 per cent for renewable energy, including from wind, solar and biomass sources, in electrical energy generation. We will also seek an increase of about 10 per cent in energy efficiency and will add a share of 16 per cent of ethanol fuel and other sugarcane-derived biomass sources to our energy mix. Brazil is thus contributing decisively to the global efforts to implement the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has established a limit of no more than 2°C on temperature increases for this century.
We are one of the few developing countries to set an absolute emissions reduction target. Our intended nationally determined contributions include actions to increase environmental resilience and reduce the risks associated with the negative effects of climate change for the poorest and most vulnerable populations, with an emphasis on gender issues, workers’ rights and the rights of indigenous, former black slave and traditional communities.
We recognize the importance of South-South cooperation in the global efforts to counter climate change. Allow me to stress that, since 2003, social and income transfer policies have helped lift over 36 million people out of extreme poverty. Last year, Brazil was officially removed from the World Hunger Map. This is a testament to the effectiveness of our so-called zero-hunger policy, which has now evolved to become Sustainable Development Goal 2.
In the transition to a low-carbon economy, it is important to ensure dignified and fair conditions for workers. Sustainable development requires us to commit to the promotion of decent work, the generation of quality jobs and guaranteed opportunities for all.
Our efforts to eradicate poverty and promote development must be collective and global in scope. In my country, however, we know that the end of extreme poverty is only the beginning of a long journey marked by new gains. For six years, we have been working to
prevent the impact of the world crisis that began in 2008 in the developed world from overwhelming our economy and our society. During those six years, we have adopted a comprehensive set of measures, including reducing taxes, expanding credit, strengthening investment and stimulating household consumption. We have increased employment opportunities and income levels in that period. This effort has now come to an end owing to both domestic fiscal constraints and external conditions. The slow recovery of the world economy and the end of the ”commodity super cycle” have negatively affected our economic growth. Currency devaluation and recession pressures have triggered inflation and a substantial reduction in tax revenue, leading to restrictions in public finance.
Brazil does not have any serious structural problems, however. Our problems are limited to the current circumstances. In order to address this situation, we are rebalancing our budget and have substantially reduced public expenditures and even investments. We have realigned prices. We are adopting measures to permanently reduce spending. We have proposed drastic spending cuts and we are redefining our sources of revenue. All of these initiatives are aimed at reorganizing the fiscal framework, reducing inflation, consolidating macroeconomic stability, boosting confidence in the economy and ensuring the resumption of economic growth with income distribution.
The Brazilian economy is today stronger, more solid and more resilient than it was a few years ago. We are in a position to overcome the current difficulties as we advance on our path towards development. We find ourselves at a moment of transition to another cycle of economic expansion, one that has greater depth and is more solid and long-lasting. In addition to the fiscal and financial rebalancing actions and providing incentives for exports, we have also adopted measures to encourage investments in infrastructure and energy.
In Brazil, the process of social inclusion has not been interrupted. We hope that inflation control and the resumption of economic growth and credit availability will help to further expand household consumption. This is the basis for a new development cycle, led by an increase in productivity and the generation of more investment opportunities for businesses and more job opportunities for citizens.
The gains we have achieved over the past few years have been reached in the environment of our strengthened and deepened democracy. Thanks to an
effective legal framework and vigorous democratic institutions, the functioning of the State is being firmly and impartially examined by the judiciary and the governmental agencies in charge of investigating, assessing and punishing any misconduct.
The Brazilian Government and society do not and will not tolerate corruption. Brazil’s democracy grows stronger when its authorities recognize the limits imposed by the law as their own limits. We Brazilians desire a country where the law represents the limit. Many of us fought for that, precisely when laws and rights were being violated during the military dictatorship. We desire a country where governmental authorities conduct themselves strictly according to their duties, without ever succumbing to excess; where judges try and judge cases freely and impartially, without any pressure whatsoever, independent of political passion and without ever compromising on the presumption of the innocence of any citizen.
We desire a country where the clash of ideas takes place in a civilized and respectful environment. We want a country where the freedom of the press is one of the cornerstones of the freedom of speech and of the expression of different positions, namely, the rights of all Brazilians. Legal sanctions must be applied against all those who have committed illicit acts, bearing in mind the need to uphold the principle of due process. Those are the very foundations of our democracy. In that regard, I wish to avail myself of a recent quote by my friend José Mujica, former President of Uruguay. He said: “Democracy is not perfect, for we are not perfect. However, we must defend it in order to improve it and not deny it”. Allow me to state for the record that Brazil will continue on the path of democracy and will never relinquish the achievements for which we have so greatly struggled.
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that Brazil welcomes citizens from around the world, with open arms, for the 2016 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games to be held in Rio de Janeiro. We look forward to welcoming each and every one. It will be a unique opportunity to promote sport as a key instrument for peace, social inclusion and tolerance in the fight against racial, ethnic and gender discrimination. It will also be an opportunity to promote the rights and inclusion of persons with disabilities, one of the top priorities of my Government.
One last point is that a few days ago, here at United Nations Headquarters, the murals entitled War and
Peace by the Brazilian artist Candido Portinari, which were donated to this Organization by the Government of my country in 1957, were re-inaugurated. Those works of art denounce violence and poverty and further urge the people of the world to seek mutual understanding and tolerance. They stand as a symbol of the ultimate responsibility of the United Nations, namely, to prevent armed conflict and promote peace, social justice and the eradication of hunger and poverty. Portinari often stated that “there is no great work of art that is not identified by the people surrounding it”. The message of the murals remains timely and topical. It speaks not only to the victims of wars, but also to the refugees who risk their lives on fragile boats in the Mediterranean and to all of the anonymous people who turn to the United Nations seeking protection, peace and well-being.
We hope that, as we walk into the premises of the United Nations and gaze upon those very murals at the entrance, we may be capable of hearing the voices of the people we represent and of working persistently to ensure that their calls for peace and progress are met. After all, those were the very ideals that were present 70 years ago at the foundation of the United Nations Organization, this major accomplishment of humankind."
70,2015,GBR,"Nearly 70 years ago, the first meetings of the General Assembly and the Security Council took place in London. They marked the point when the world came together to turn its back on war and to seek to institutionalize the conditions for peace. By that process, from the ashes of the Second World War, our predecessors embarked upon a shared quest for peace, development and human dignity.
And they succeeded where the League of Nations had failed. From 51 Members at its inception to 193 now, the United Nations has become a powerful and universally recognized expression of our collective will to find solutions to the most difficult challenges we face. It is the cornerstone of the rules-based international system and an affirmation of the value we attach to human dignity and hope.
Britain is proud to have played its role in the birth of the Organization. And proud too, 70 years later, of the active role we play in international affairs as the only Security Council member, indeed the only major economy in the world, that both meets the NATO 2 per cent target for defence spending and the United Nations 0.7 per cent target for development spending.
But seven decades on, the daily reality for millions of people is a very far cry from the ideals set out in the Charter of the United Nations. Despite the historic work delivered under the Millennium Development Goals, more than a billion people still live on less than $1.25 a day. Insecurity, extremism and conflict in the
Middle East have driven millions of people to abandon their homes, creating a humanitarian emergency on an unprecedented scale. And many millions more still live under regimes in which they have no say about how they are governed, and in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are denied.
At the same time, the rules-based international system that keeps the peace between nations is being undermined by States willing to violate the territorial integrity of others or to breach the most fundamental prohibitions on weapons of mass destruction. And alongside these challenges, we face the longer term threats of climate change, global pandemics and anti-microbial resistance — threats that we must tackle effectively now, if we are not to put the lives of future generations at risk.
But it is in Syria and Iraq, in the crucible of human civilization, that our collective values and our will to act are being most immediately challenged. The twin evils of Al-Assad’s murderous regime and the brutality of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or Daesh, have inflicted suffering on the Syrian people on an almost unimaginable scale. The humanitarian crisis, the tide of refugees seeking sanctuary in neighbouring countries and in Europe, underscore the urgent need to end the conflict and represent huge tests of our resolve.
I want to pay tribute to the extraordinary generosity of Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which have given a temporary home to many millions of refugees and which have accepted this role stoically for years. It is incumbent upon all of us to support them as they bear that burden, and to ensure that the United Nations appeals for Syria are fully funded. And I am proud that the United Kingdom is making the second-largest contribution of any country to the humanitarian mission in the region.
We judge it important that we seek to support those who have been displaced as close as possible to their homes. Because there will be a new Syria to build, post-Al-Assad, and that country will need to draw on the talent of all the Syrian people. But a humanitarian response alone is not adequate. We share a responsibility to act to end the bloody civil war and create an inclusive political process, and to work together to crush ISIL and banish its twisted ideology from the face of the Earth. The United Kingdom will continue to be a leading member of the international coalition against ISIL, including in carrying out more air strikes in Iraq than any other country except the United States, for as
15-29595 19/23

A/70/PV.18 29/09/2015
long as it takes to prevail in what will ultimately be a generational struggle against the Islamist extremist ideology that drives it.
But the defeat of ISIL on its own will not bring peace to Syria. An inclusive political settlement is the only sustainable way to end the suffering of the Syrian people. We must redouble our efforts to build a political process under Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, and to hold to account those who have committed crimes during the conflict. Positive movement on this agenda is a crucial test for the United Nations. Progress at the Security Council has been blocked for too long. All parties must now put narrow interests aside and cooperate for the good of the Syrian people and to reassert the values of this Organization.
Urgent though the crisis in Syria is — and to that we could add the crises in Yemen, Somalia and Libya — we cannot neglect the need to act now to prevent future threats to global security from arising. But that collective action will truly work only if we have a shared analysis of the real causes of poverty, injustice, and the conflict that feeds upon it. We need a common recognition that strong, transparent and effective institutions, open economies and open societies, the rule of law, and freedom from corruption are the conditions that will allow development to flourish over the long term and so reduce the drivers that fuel conflict. They provide what Prime Minister David Cameron has called “the golden thread of development” and they are vital to the success of the Sustainable Development Goals. Each country must, of course, follow its own path to prosperity. But as we help the poorest countries overcome conflict, poverty and instability and to move up the development curve, it is in all our interests that that development be sustainable over the long term.
And the foundation for all sustainable development is security. As a permanent member of the Security Council, the United Kingdom places security as the prerequisite to good governance, strong institutions and economic development at the core of its approach. So, as the Prime Minister pledged yesterday, the United Kingdom will resume a significant role in enabling peacekeeping operations, particularly in Africa, where the United Kingdom will support efforts by the United Nations and the African Union to end some of the world’s most destabilizing conflicts, conflicts that are prompting mass migration from South Sudan and sustaining terrorist groups in Somalia.
But there is another important truth to understand — security within countries can deliver the benefits of economic growth only if it is matched by security among countries. Britain has always believed that the stability we seek in relations between nations is best realized through the framework of laws, norms and institutions that together constitute the rules- based international system that was developed after the Second World War, with the Charter of the United Nations at its heart.
Fundamental to that system is the fact that States should respect one another’s territorial integrity and political independence. When States challenge those rules, all of us have a duty to come swiftly and unambiguously to the defence of the victims. That is why we stand shoulder to shoulder with the Ukrainian people. Illegal actions and State aggression must have consequences, or the international order will be fatally undermined. We, the United Nations, insist that differences and disputes be resolved within the framework of international law, not outside it.
The collective will to tackle threats to our security must be extended to the threat we face from climate change. It represents not just a threat to the environment and to our prosperity, but to our security too. The impact of rising sea levels and rising global temperatures will be felt by all of us, but it will hit hardest many of the poorest countries and those who are least able to adapt. So the United Kingdom will not only cut its emissions at home but, as our Prime Minister announced on Monday, also increase its support to climate finance for vulnerable countries to $9 billion over the next five years. We must work for a strong and effective deal at the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December, built upon clear commitments from all nations to lower emissions targets still further, and a collective commitment to maintain the goal of limiting global warming to two degrees.
Seventy years after the first session of the General Assembly, the United Nations stands battered by the waves of international crises but unbowed, proudly at the heart of the international order. Over seven decades, it has played a critical role in addressing almost every challenge we have faced. And crucial to its future success will be further evolution, embracing change, and maintaining relevance in this twenty-first century. The United Nations must strive to represent the new realities of our age with a reformed Security

Council. It must have the best possible leadership, with a transparent system for selecting the next Secretary-General. And he — or dare I suggest perhaps she? — will have to head a more efficient Organization ensuring that every cent it receives from its Member States is used to maximum effect.
As a founding Member of the United Nations, and as a permanent member of the Security Council, the United Kingdom will champion that reform agenda, and we will continue to promote the ideals that the United Nations represents. Seventy years ago, a generation resolved to shape their world on a vision for peace, security and universal values. Today, realizing that vision in its totality still eludes us, but we have demonstrated that when we work together collectively we can take great strides towards it. Now we must resolve to demonstrate that collective will; to recognize that it is not only our moral duty, but also in the enlightened national interests of all of us to act; to respond to the grave humanitarian crises we face; to tackle the causes of conflict, poverty and instability; and to uphold the rules-based international system.
The world is a better place because of the foundation of the United Nations by our predecessors 70 years ago. By holding firm to our ideals as United Nations Members in the face of all challenges and all temptations, we will preserve their legacy and continue to build the foundations for a better age, an age of peace, hope and dignity for all.
"
70,2015,SUR,"On behalf of President Desiré Delano Bouterse and the Government and the people of the Republic of Suriname, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session, a landmark anniversary for our global body of nations. We pledge our full support to you in the successful execution of your duties. We also wish to take this opportunity to salute your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his skilful leadership and commitment in helping to shape the new global agenda, and we wish him well in his future endeavours. And we would like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his sterling efforts in guiding our Organization through these challenging times for international peace, prosperity and security.
At its inception 70 years ago, the United Nations made a commitment to saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, reaffirming faith in fundamental human rights, establishing global justice and promoting social progress. The ensuing seven decades have unquestionably brought many achievements. The United Nations, in collaboration with its Member States, specialized organizations and other relevant stakeholders, including civil society, has promoted and assured access to education for boys and girls around the world, brought humanitarian relief to those in need, assisted societies in restoring democracy and supported defenders of human rights. It has given a voice to marginalized groups, especially the elderly, women, young people, indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities, and played a crucial role in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.
However, despite such advances, there still remain challenges such as armed conflicts, the rise of fundamentalism, disregard for fundamental human rights and freedoms and global health concerns such as
15-29946 15/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases, as well as the devastating effects of climate change and natural disasters. My Government therefore applauds the timely and inspiring themes chosen for this general debate and for the session as a whole: “The United Nations at 70: a new commitment to action” and “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”. Given that context, it was only fitting that we should adopt our new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). In that spirit, therefore, we, the global community, must recommit to the ideals of peace and security, human rights and sustainable development.
Combating climate change is high on my Government’s national agenda. Last Wednesday, my President reiterated its importance for our country’s development and future in his address to Parliament on the occasion of the presentation of our annual budget and our Government policy statement for the period 2015-2020.
Although Suriname is South America’s smallest country, we are home to about 8 per cent of the world’s untouched tropical forest. With around 94 per cent of the country covered by rainforest, we can proudly inform the Assembly that we are the greenest nation on Earth. Approximately 12 per cent of our total acreage, including the Central Suriname Nature Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been designated a natural protected area. Our rivers carry between 10 and 15 per cent of the world’s supply of fresh water. We can be seen as almost unique, since we are one of the few carbon-negative countries in the world.
Despite such wondrous natural blessings, my country continues to see the first effects of climate change. Suriname has 239 miles of low-lying coastline and is listed as one of the seven countries in the world most vulnerable to the effects of the rising sea level. My Government looks forward to the establishment of a new global agreement on climate change in Paris later this year. It should include specific actions aimed at meeting mitigation and adaptation commitments. It will be necessary to make the provision of financial resources a priority, especially for small island developing States and countries with low-lying coasts, if we are to implement the necessary measures effectively. In that regard, we welcome the further implementation of the Green Climate Fund, including the ongoing efforts to create a logical framework model for financing for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation in Developing Countries, or REDD-plus. In the context of its intended nationally determined contribution, the Republic of Suriname will submit a new climate action plan to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The Americas are committed to peace and security as a precursor of sustainable development. The proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace is testimony to our use of a multifaceted approach to assure the long-term development of our continent and peoples. My Government underscores the critical importance of the processes of dialogue and diplomacy as essential contributing elements to democracy, peace, stability and security. My Government therefore supports the peaceful and negotiated settlement of various types of dispute, including border disagreements.
My Government welcomes the positive steps taken towards normalizing bilateral relations between the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America. Suriname has a longstanding friendship with the people of Cuba, and we are of the view that the ongoing process of strengthening relations will help to enhance peace, stability, unity and development in the Americas. We agree with the international community that lifting the economic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba should be a top priority.
Decades ago, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a cornerstone document that has inspired the adoption of various standard-setting human rights instruments at the international and regional levels.
My Government is concerned about the loss of life and destruction resulting from current violence and ongoing armed conflict. We are also concerned about the current humanitarian crisis caused by the huge numbers of refugees fleeing the Middle East and Africa.
Issues related to gender equality and the empowerment of women, particularly that of increasing women’s political participation at all levels, continue to be of particular interest to the international community. My Government applauds the commitments made in that regard by the Heads of State and Government at last week’s global leaders’ meeting here in New York. It is vital that we undertake the necessary measures to prevent all forms of discrimination at all
16/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
levels, including establishing relevant legislative and administrative frameworks.
Despite the many positive developments with respect to shaping the international agenda over the past seven decades, the socioeconomic development of and existing social inequality in a number of regions still remain alarming. My Government is of the view that human-centred economic development policies are instrumental in guaranteeing the realization of social developmental goals for the benefit of our peoples and countries. My Government emphasizes that there is an urgent need for an international enabling environment, including access to financing for development, in order to alleviate all forms of poverty and to create economic opportunities that enable all peoples and countries to prosper.
Indeed, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development can fulfil a critical role in gradually advancing sustainable development and equality. At the national level, my Government adopted the integrated Strategy for Sustainable Development, which emphasizes the centrality of the human being in our developmental efforts.
The United Nations at 70 is at a critical stage to become a more efficient and effective global institution, adequately resourced and fit for the challenges ahead. We the peoples of the world have to carry forward the renewed hopes and aspirations of the Organization. Suriname stands ready to play its part in strengthening multilateralism in partnership with other States and civil society to protect and preserve the planet and to ensure that everyone has a fair chance to develop his or her fullest potential for a better life.
"
70,2015,KHM,"At the outset, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I am fully confident that under his able leadership our Assembly will produce results.
This year’s gathering is taking place at a critical juncture, as we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. It is an opportunity to reflect on how our world body can deal with today’s global challenges. Cambodia warmly welcomes the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), an ambitious vision for building an inclusive society through sustainable development and putting the world on a path to more equitable prosperity for
all by 2030. But we believe that the lessons learned from the Millennium Development Goals will be key to ensuring success with the new Agenda. We sincerely hope that over the next 15 years, all stakeholders from developed and developing countries alike will join hands in pursuit of our vital new Agenda.
Poverty, food insecurity and similar problems still remain as stumbling blocks along the way ahead. Today, more than 800 million people are undernourished and living below the poverty line. The world’s population will reach 9 billion by 2050, and the pressure on food security will be further exacerbated. I believe that the answers to that challenge include good governance, policy reform and more investment in food production.
Such challenges, aggravated by armed conflicts, have forced increasing numbers of people to flee their home countries. The refugee phenomenon, exploited by human traffickers, has now reached an alarming scale in Europe, though perhaps to a lesser degree in Asia. Cambodia would like to express its deep sympathy for the recent tragedies that have afflicted maritime migrants in Europe.
Climate change constitutes another serious global challenge. While it is the industrialized countries that have been the major emitters of greenhouse gases, it is the developing countries, which are largely dependent on agriculture, that have become the prime victims of climate change, with storms, typhoons and more frequent floods and droughts, which have a major impact on their food security, poverty and social welfare. Cambodia very much hopes, therefore, that the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December, can produce a binding agreement, in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, that will enable us to deal effectively with the global threat of climate change and its impact on people’s welfare.
For its part, Cambodia officially launched the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan 2014-2023 in November 2013 as the first-ever comprehensive national strategic plan to respond to climate change through adaptation, mitigation and low-carbon development. We also adopted the National Strategic Plan on Green Development for 2013-2030. Additionally, Cambodia has launched its National Council of Green Growth aimed at promoting a green economy.
On international issues, Cambodia notes that criminal acts committed by the violent extremist group the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and many other groups under different names in Africa and Asia continue to intensify and spread, in spite of allied bombing and national-level military operations. Cambodia believes that all nations should forge concerted efforts to fight those criminal and inhuman groups in a comprehensive and effective manner.
Cambodia welcomes the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States after 52 years of an unjust embargo against the Cuban people. It also demands that all blockades be lifted unconditionally, following the resumption of diplomatic relations.
Cambodia also welcomes the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the nuclear programme between Iran and the P5 plus Germany. It shares the view that this agreement will not only become a turning point in Iran- United States relations, but that it will also create an atmosphere conducive to regional peace, security and political stability.
In the light of current realities, Cambodia supports the United Nations reform aimed at making the Organization more democratic and more effective in coping with the crucial challenges the world is facing. To that end, in Cambodia’s view, the General Assembly should be more empowered to enhance global governance in the United Nations system. At the same time, the Economic and Social Council has to follow up on the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted unanimously by our leaders a few days ago. The Security Council should also become more democratic and representative in both its permanent and its non-permanent membership so as to be able to assure universal peace and security in the face of the evolving dangerous situation that prevails in the world today.
"
70,2015,COM,"As I take the floor for the last time before the General Assembly after five years in office as President of the Union of the Comoros, I wish to discharge the duty of conveying to the General Assembly a message of solidarity from the Comoran people. In the name of the Government of the Comoros, and on my own behalf, I would also like to express our sincerest thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and to all those who have helped to make our stay in New York so warm, in particular the authorities of the United States of America. Lastly, I would like to congratulate the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventieth session, the importance of which is manifestly clear.
This session opens at a crucial moment in the development of humankind. Since man first appeared on Earth, we are the first generation in the vast expanse of time — perhaps 3 million years after the appearance of our remote ancestors — to be aware of the physical laws that govern us and of the unfortunate effects of the irrational use of natural resources. As in 1918, after the Great War, that incomparable horror, and as in 1945, after the victory over fascism, that base ideology, but also as in the 1990s, when we faced the absurdity of an arms race in weapons of mass destruction, today as before, nothing prevents us from uniting to effectively combat pollution and poverty.
As world leaders aware of our responsibility in the face of impending disaster, we must rationally work here and now to save humankind, and we are capable of
doing so. We must take advantage of this unprecedented international setting to harness the efforts of all nations to make our planet sustainable and equitable before 2030, through a programme of surpassing ambition. Therefore, at the moment when the Assembly has just adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), I wish to commend the outstanding and consistent work that was done under the impetus of the Secretary-General.
My country, the Union of the Comoros, fully endorses the agreed Agenda, which consolidates the gains of the Millennium Development Goals while paving the way to a new era through 17 Sustainable Development Goals to be met over the next 15 years. We must therefore commit ourselves to putting a definitive end to poverty in all its forms, to eradicating hunger and to promoting sustainable agriculture in order to guarantee food security, good health and the well-being of all all. We must also guarantee a quality education for all without exception, promote lifelong learning opportunities for all and ensure gender equality, as well as the full empowerment of women.
It is also our duty to ensure the availability, sustainable management and cleanliness of water for all and to guarantee access to clean, affordable and sustainable energy in order to promote sustained economic growth. To that end, several countries should immediately begin work on major projects to build resilient infrastructure, to promote sustainable, inclusive industrialization and to encourage innovation everywhere that will reduce inequalities within and among countries. We cannot imagine that humankind will thrive on Earth unless urgent action is taken to combat climate change and its impacts, while conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.
It is in this way that we will promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosуstems, manage forests sustainably, combat desertification, combat and halt land degradation and put an end to the loss of biodiversity. We will need to find ways and means to continue to build peace throughout the world in the framework of sustainable development. And we must have access to justice for all, and establish effective and accountable institutions at all levels. Lastly, we must build a world without poverty or inequalities, a sustainable world through a new road map that will save humankind. Therefore let us take on ambitious goals, for our very survival depends on it.

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
As I stressed earlier, we face a situation similar to that which our very close ancestors experienced with sadness and suffering, but against which they struggled until victory was achieved. I call it slavery, a system that almost exterminated a large part of humankind, quite simply because one side thought itself superior to all the others. We face a situation somewhat similar to that experienced by our countries during the two world wars, but for which our peoples gave their lives with courage and temerity until the final victory to save humankind from chaos. We face legitimate questions that were asked by our ancestors when, for half a century, they powerlessly bore witness to an arms race that was leading humankind inexorably towards its own destruction, but where common sense eventually prevailed. We face a situation akin to that faced by almost all African countries, including my own, which for decades were subjected to the misdeeds of colonialism, but against which the valiant peoples of Africa, Latin America and Asia fought until acquiring their sovereignty and the independence of their territories, thereby saving humankind from indignity, decadence and shame.
Today, the world is directly following the consequences of wars that forced millions of men, women and children to leave their homelands, to board makeshift boats and to take refuge and live in inhumane conditions, and sometimes even to remain indigent. If we add to that the barbaric acts perpetrated by terrorist movements, which are increasing throughout the world, especially in Africa, it is time for that international community to speak with one voice and with firm conviction and to decisively say, “never again”.
In a world of complete deprivation, where each nation must take part in safeguarding international security, how can we, in a small country like mine, be engaged in the fight if, at the same time, we must be on the front lines to defend our dignity, which has been disregarded by a permanent member of the Security Council of the Organization, whose primary role is to ensure compliance with the norms of international law?
I must underscore that the Union of the Comoros is the only country in the world, which, at the time of its accession to independence, did not benefit from respect for the law. Unlike all former colonies, the archipelago of the Comoros, composed of the islands of Mayotte, Anjouan, Moheli and Grande Comore, which was admitted to the United Nations as an independent State and subjected to international law, has been separated
from a part of its territory by the former colonial Power, France, in contravention of all norms and principles governing international relations.
Those present here will recall that, against the will of the Comorian people, France exercised its veto and continues to exercise its power over our territory. Given what is happening in Eastern Europe today, we wonder what significance the European Union gives to compliance with international law by accepting the Comorian island of Mayotte as a European outermost region, contrary to the relevant resolutions of the African Union, the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Non-Aligned Movement.
At previous sessions, I informed the Assembly that we had signed a political declaration with President François Hollande in Paris that enabled us to hope that bilaterally a solution could be found that would give Comorians back their dignity. Unfortunately, to date France has refused to acknowledge that all Comorians, from whichever island they come, may freely move around the islands. Separated families, abandoned minors, displacements of populations in makeshift boats, precisely as is occurring in the Mediterranean Sea — all of that leads me to urge the Secretary- General to demand the application of international law, as France itself is rightly claims each time that international norms governing international life are contravened.
Of course, the main objective of the high joint council established between France and the Comoros is to facilitate bilateral dialogue and rebuild the trust that had disappeared between the two countries. However, we must note that the main mission assigned to that Council — facilitating movement of goods and peoples — has still not been accomplished. By continuing to defy international law on the issue of the Comorian Island of Mayotte, France has prevented the expected results and progress from being achieved in the dialogue between the two parties. From this rostrum, therefore, I once again appeal to the French authorities for us together to find ways and means to put an end this human tragedy, which every day causes Comorian families to plunge into mourning. I also address the community of nations, which those in this Hall represent, to ask that international law be applied so that a lasting solution to this dispute can be found.
With political will, nothing is impossible. I therefore welcome the fact that Palestine has finally been able
24/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
to hoist its flag at the United Nations. I also welcome the fact that Cuba and United States of America have proved that, even after half a century of conflict, States can find formulas adapted to overcome deadlocks and foresee a peaceful future for their peoples. Lastly, I welcome the historic agreement concluded between Iran and the countries of the P5+1 on the nuclear issue, which augurs well for a calmer international cooperation.
In a few months, after five years in office in a rotating presidency that fell to the island of Moheli, a Comorian from the island of Grand Comore will succeed me, in accordance with our Constitution. In that electoral democratic process under way, I would appeal for support from the international community and from the friends of the Comoros for the victory of our young democracy. I also appeal to everyone here that, after the scheduled elections, Member States will support our country on the path towards stability, development and well-being of the Comorian people.
As my country stands ready, after 40 years of independence, to begin the second phase of its history, I remain confident that in the future the next President of the Comoros will be able to say from this rostrum of free countries,
“We have now achieved the territorial integrity and unity of my country, the Comoros, within its borders inherited from colonization.”
I also remain confident that my successor will be able to say from this rostrum of free countries,
“I thank the United Nations for having actively acted for the achievement of the main goals inscribed in our common Charter.”
Lastly, I remain confident that a President from the Comoros will be able to say to his compatriots from the four islands,
“The time has come for all of us to work together to build our free, open and prosperous country, one which is confident in its future and in its people’s destiny.”
"
70,2015,POL,"I congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, on his election to that honourable office. I wish to assure you, Mr. President, of Poland’s full support for your actions.
Peace and law: those are the two key words that enable us to understand and appreciate the importance of the United Nations over past 70 years in the world’s history. Peace and law, two words without which it is impossible to imagine the coexistence of nations, different ethnic groups and the followers of the various religions. Peace and law: they are beautiful and important concepts, but extremely fragile ones that we need to take care of and to cultivate unceasingly.
We Poles know full well that peace is not to be taken for granted. Less than one month ago, it was incumbent on me, as President of the Republic of Poland, to deliver a speech at the commemoration of the seventy-sixth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War. At dawn on 1 September 1939, the invasion of Nazi Germany against my home country was unleashed. Seventeen days later, on 17 September 1939, we received a blow from the other side, when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics attacked Poland, and Poland vanished from the map. However, the Poles are a proud nation, and they did not give up, because what they love, above all, is freedom. That is why they fought, to the end, on the side of the free world.
The Second World War, the greatest and bloodiest in the history of humankind, caused the whole of Europe, East and South-East Asia, North Africa, the Middle East and all the oceans to plunge into the dark reign of crime, barbarity and suffering. International law fell, as one of the first victims of the war back then. The next victim was human rights, starting from the fundamental right to live and ending with the rights of soldiers in combat, the rights of civilians crushed under bombing raids and the rights of refugees. The scale of terror, destruction and lawlessness committed during those days put the international community to a serious test. The need appeared to step up efforts to protect peace and safeguard it for the future.
The year 1945 marked more than the end of the Second World War; it was also the birth year of the United Nations, the most fundamental mechanism for cooperation within the international community, advocating for global peace and security. In 1945, international criminal courts were established in Nuremberg and Tokyo. Lastly, the 1940s also marked the adoption of two particularly crucial documents: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the concept of which was largely formulated by Raphael Lemkin, a great Pole of Jewish descent, an eminent lawyer and university lecturer and a nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize. Lemkin was fluent in nine languages, but he was most fluent in the language of law. He noted the absence of an important word. It was Lemkin who invented and applied the term
of genocide in legal language for the first time. The Polish lawyer had direct experience of genocide: almost all of his family perished — murdered in the German camps of annihilation.
The emphasis on the respect for international law, as well as the unconditional punishment of those responsible for war crimes, was meant to be one of the ways and means to prevent bloody conflicts in the future. As Pope John Paul II observed, “Peace and international law are closely linked to each other; law favours peace”. Unfortunately, international treaties are still being violated, solemn pledges are being neglected, and human rights are commonly being trampled. We should constantly recall that fact. We can never be reminded too often that international law is a fundamental value and a fundamental tool for building peace in the world and that no declarations made by the leaders of States, no promises, no entreaties, can replace treaties, conventions and resolutions. No negotiations behind closed doors may ever lead to the violation and trampling of international law and resolutions. All States should be afforded the equal enjoyment of the rights vested in them, and any actions undermining those rules should be firmly rejected by the international community.
Poland, so gravely affected by the Second World War and by over 40 years of oppression from the communist regime, is particularly sensitive to the use of force in the relations between States, the use of armed aggression and the violation of human rights. Poland feels an obligation to remind everyone that such methods are not only immoral and incompatible with the broadly understood concept of humanism, but above all, they violate international law. That is why I would like to forcefully reiterate that, when a State perpetrates an act of aggression, basing its foreign policy on faits accomplis through the use of tanks, missiles and bombs, the international community has an obligation to reject the facts created through such means.
In that regard, it is crucially important to continue to work on streamlining the effectiveness of the Security Council, the body responsible for protecting international peace. It must be constantly recalled that the privilege of permanent membership is connected with the duty to take active measures to implement the fundamental goals of the United Nations as set forth in Article 1 of the Charter. In recent years, the right to the veto has led, on many occasions, to a total stalemate 
in the Council’s work, precisely on the most important security issues. That is why Poland supports the French proposal to adopt a code of conduct for refraining from the use of the veto when members are confronted by the gravest crimes under international law, including the crime of genocide.
Let us look at the world today, which is so assailed by trouble. With millions of people suffering from war, destitution, famine and religious persecutions, can we afford to circumvent the principles enshrined in the Charter? Should we be turning a blind eye to breaches of existing commitments or to actions taken from a position of power or based on faits accomplis? Should we wave aside manipulations of the law and propaganda activities that seek to justify base and illegal actions? The answer is no, and that must be the answer of every decent and honest human being and politician.
The former President of the Republic of Poland, Professor Lech Kaczyński, addressing the Assembly in this Hall back in 2009, pointed out that the violation of the territorial integrity of States always gives rise to conflicts on a global scale (see A/64/PV.4). In my capacity as President of Poland, I would also like to express, on behalf of my country, my opposition to a world built on a division into zones of influence, and my rejection of acts of aggression perpetrated by those who, driven by their interests and ambitions, ignore the provisions of international law, thereby thwarting the collective work of the United Nations over the past 70 years. In our part of Europe, we know all too well the costs to be incurred as the result of such policies, especially in the absence of a decisive reaction and the solidarity of other States in the early stages of an aggression.
Contempt for international law may turn out, in fact, to be one of the seeds of war. And once war has broken out, there is generally no rule of law in the territories overwhelmed by warfare. We see that in the Middle East, where State institutions have been either excessively strained or replaced by private armies, terrorist militias and self-proclaimed courts. That constitutes yet another challenge to both the world and the United Nations. With increasing frequency, conflicts arise in which it is almost impossible to define the opposing sides and in which combat is carried out not by States, but rather by indeterminate armed groups in which it is difficult to distinguish a soldier from a civilian. How are we to adjust existing regulations to deal with such new circumstances, which, in the eyes of many politicians and specialists in international law, have still not been fully researched and understood?
Unfortunately, one thing has remained unchanged for centuries: in various parts of the world, in numerous conflict situations, the freedom of conscience and religion are systematically restrained. Members of religious minorities, nowadays especially Christians, are exposed to persecution. In the Middle East, the incidence of acts of violence targeting members of Christian churches is growing at an alarming pace. Nor should we forget the plight of the Yazidi community, which has been murdered and evicted from its native soil. Poland appeals to the international community to take decisive steps to protect the rights of religious minorities.
Military conflicts in the Middle East are taking a toll of thousands of innocent lives and violating the social and economic stability of the region. The militants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant continue to pillage museums, defile Christian and Shia shrines, and blow up the remains of ancient metropolises. At the end of August, we were informed about the destruction of temple Baal Shamin in Palmyra, a monument with 2,000 years of tradition. UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova has stated that the devastation of that temple constitutes nothing less than a war crime. In the face of those beastly acts, the international community should take more decisive steps in order to stem the practice of destroying and looting the world heritage of humanity.
Never since the start of the United Nations has the international community had to address a humanitarian crisis on a scale such as the one it faces today. Poland is working to reinforce the global system of humanitarian aid by fostering cooperation among international institutions, Governments, law enforcement and nongovernmental organizations. At the same time, there needs to be greater emphasis on the relationship between humanitarian aid and aid for development. Here, I would like to mention with great satisfaction the contribution of Polish humanitarian organizations, which actively support those in need. They have built schools and welfare centres, drilled wells, provided clothing and blankets, assisted the victims of conflicts and responded in the wake of natural disasters. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincerest gratitude to all good-hearted people and to the people of conscience who are providing assistance to others, often at the risk of their own lives.
Respect for human rights is a key premise for the maintenance of peace and justice in the lives of States and nations.
For Poland, the defence of the freedom of conscience, worship and speech is of particular importance. And the freedom of speech entails the duty to tell the truth. Nothing is more poisonous to the relations among peoples and States than manipulating the truth or spreading lies and degrading stereotypes. That is why the truth, including the truth about history, is such a crucial component of relations among States and nations.
Here, I would like to highlight the fate of those for whom standing up for truth and for freedom of speech has often been punished with imprisonment or even death at the hands of their oppressors — the courageous and uncompromising dissidents, journalists and bloggers who expose the crimes of totalitarian regimes, the atrocities perpetrated by terrorists in various corners of the world and the brutality of law enforcement authorities. We must not forget their dedication. The international community should offer them appropriate protection, including legal protection.
And there is another social group that cannot be left out when we speak about human rights, or about the effects of war and mass migration. I am thinking here of women: the mothers, wives and daughters of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine. They require our particular attention, because they suffer doubly: first, when they lose their sense of security, with war raging around them, and then when they lose their husbands, fathers, brothers or sons, sometimes without even being able to bury them. The tears of bereft women, victims of war, pose the greatest charge against humanity in the twenty-first century.
The defence of democracy, sustainable economic growth, the elimination of social inequalities, broader access to education and the long-term mitigation of the impacts of climate change — all those measures contribute to the preservation of world peace. In that context, I wish to assure the Assembly of my country’s readiness to participate in the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (resolution 70/1). Poland has, among other things, actively participated in the current international effort to achieve a new climate agreement. We see the need to reach a permanent understanding in that field, one that will be joined by all States and will engage the efforts of all States in proportion to their actual capabilities. In other ways,
Poland has had an impressive track record with regard to environmental protection. Suffice it to say that our economic transformation has contributed to the lowering of carbon dioxide emissions in Poland by 30 per cent since 1990.
We also stand ready to increase our direct contribution to peacekeeping and the preservation of security. In that spirit, we have submitted our candidacy to be a non-permanent member of the Security Council. Poland, still mindful of the tragedy of the Second World War and the communist era, pledges to actively cooperate in building an international order based on the rule of law. Law contributes to the effective functioning of the societies of which our States are composed. But it also serves to help establish effective and peaceful arrangements among States themselves. Let us therefore create a world founded on the strength of the rule of law and not on the law of force."
70,2015,PRT,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session on his election and to express my good wishes for the success of the General Assembly’s work in the seventieth-anniversary year of the United Nations. I would also like to express my deep appreciation for the work of the Secretary-General. As ever, he can continue to count on Portugal’s support.
The establishment of the United Nations marked a unique time in the collective history of humankind. The pursuit of lasting peace, development and the respect for human rights, the founding purposes and principles of the Organization that we still look to today, after 70 years, are major achievements of the contemporary world. The Charter of the United Nations and the principles and values that it encapsulates remain a reference and a sign of hope for our collective future. I welcome the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which is an unparalleled opportunity to usher in an era in which poverty is eradicated, leading to a world of justice and dignity for all.
The year 2015 is also key for negotiations on climate change. Seventeen years after Kyoto, the international community must be ambitious in fighting that particular threat to its sustainable development. It is imperative
that at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December, we reach a lasting agreement that is global, fair and binding for all.
Closely related to climate change, the issue of the oceans holds a crucial importance for Portugal in the light of its history, its geography and its identity. In June, my country organized an international event on the use of the oceans, Blue Week, which brought together more than 70 countries and international institutions. It offered an occasion for open debate and strategic reflection on the challenges of global management of the oceans and the responsible use of their potential.
We continue to take a strong interest in deepening the multilateral dialogue on the sustainability of the oceans and enhancing the overall efforts of the United Nations. Portugal had the honour to co-chair the Ad Hoc Working Group of the Whole on the Regular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of the Marine Environment, including Socioeconomic Aspects in setting up a reliable and detailed system of information on the marine environment. The issuance of the first global integrated marine assessment (see A/70/112) is a step in the right direction. Members can rely on the engagement of Portugal in the preparation of a legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas that go beyond national jurisdiction.
Portugal’s course of action has been geared towards the defence of the universal and individual nature of all human rights — not only civil and political rights but also economic, social and cultural rights. Combating violence against women is a clear priority in that context. I draw attention to the alarming number of cases of domestic violence that span the most diverse societies and social strata, which cannot continue to go unpunished. I invite all States to step up their efforts to put an end to that scourge, and I hope that the relative indicator will be taken into account in the overall assessment of compliance with the Sustainable Development Goals. I also stress the importance that we attach to children’s rights, including the right to education and to youth policies.
At a time when we are witnessing the proliferation of violent clashes in a number of regions, it must be emphasized that no conflict, no matter how complex it may be, can possibly justify barbarism, whether by States or by non-State parties. Human rights are the common heritage of humankind that we all have
an obligation to defend, regardless of geography. The Security Council plays a key role in that context. In order to fulfil its mandate in the most effective manner, it should mirror the realities of our world. That will require extending membership in both categories and reviewing its working methods.
The tragic humanitarian situation in Syria, Iraq, Libya and many other conflict settings should prompt us to act in a supportive and responsible manner. Some of those crises, particularly in Syria, have already claimed many thousands of human lives and given rise to one of the largest flows of refugees since the Second World War. The resolution of those crises can no longer remain hostage to blockages that prolong and aggravate the misery and suffering of vast populations. In line with its consistently humanitarian tradition, Portugal has demonstrated dedicated solidarity from the very beginning, as demonstrated by its willingness to welcome several thousand people in need of international protection.
I take this opportunity to commend the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which has epitomized the humanitarian values enshrined in the Charter. The dignity of human life is an absolute value that we have an obligation to respect and protect. On the other hand, for some years we have found ourselves facing the threat of terrorism, which continues to assume increasingly barbaric and worrying forms. That threat and its protagonists require strong, concerted responses and a determined fight on the part of the international community. Such responses should also address the underlying forces that lead to radicalization and violent extremism, which require the involvement of States, international organizations, religious communities and civil society organizations.
I must also express our concern about the deadlock affecting the peace process in the Middle East. There will be no lasting peace without a fair resolution of the Palestinian issue that also ensures Israel’s security. We urge the parties to resume the peace talks, as we are convinced that the only solution to the conflict will be the creation, based on United Nations resolutions, of two States, living side by side in democracy, peace and security.
I welcome the agreement reached on Iran’s nuclear programme. It is now up to all parties involved to ensure its full implementation.
Africa holds a special place in Portuguese foreign policy. My country has key partners in Africa, with which it maintains close relations in the most varied fields, ranging from political dialogue to economic links, from the approach to security issues to the establishment of mutually beneficial partnerships. A number of African countries where Portuguese is the official language — Mozambique, Cabo Verde, Sao Tome and Principe and Angola — are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of their independence this year, and Portugal and the Portuguese people are involved in that important historical event.
The situation in Guinea-Bissau deserves special mention. I trust its political leaders to recognize the essential value of political stability and the ability to work together in order to pursue the necessary reforms, including in the security sector, in the fight against impunity and in socioeconomic development projects. That would be the required framework for the international community to be able to fulfil its commitments to cooperation, made in March at the Brussels Conference. The democratic maturity that the people of Guinea-Bissau have demonstrated is sufficient reason for the international community to remain united and coordinated in supporting that country. We also remain engaged on matters concerning maritime safety, especially in the Gulf of Guinea. We have participated in the development of international support strategies and have strengthened our bilateral cooperation with the African States and the regional organizations.
Portugal is strengthening its relations with Latin American States. We have added a mutual willingness to know each other better and to deepen our political and economic relations to our historical and cultural ties. I very much welcome the positive developments surrounding the ongoing peace negotiations in Colombia and the normalization of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States of America.
The Portuguese language is a global, economically relevant communication vehicle. Some 250 million people from Asia to Europe and from Africa to Latin America express themselves in Portuguese in their everyday lives, in commerce and business and in cultural and social networks. It is also an official or a working language in several international organizations, including in some of the United Nations specialized agencies. The legitimate ambition of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries is to
see the Portuguese language recognized as an official language of the United Nations.
As we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, I reiterate the commitment expressed here in 2008. Portugal, 60 years now into its membership in the United Nations, remains firmly committed to effective multilateralism. It participates in many peacekeeping operations, has been in the Security Council three times, is currently a member of the Human Rights Council and fiercely stands by the guiding principles of the Charter in its international actions. In a globalized, interdependent world such as the one in which we live, only strong multilateral institutions can ensure the fundamental values of peace, human rights, sustainable development, democracy and respect for international law.
"
70,2015,LKA,"My country is a long-standing Member of the United Nations, and it is indeed an honour and a pleasure for me, as the newly elected President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, to address the General Assembly at its annual general debate. On behalf of the Government and people of Sri Lanka, I wish to heartily congratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. Let me also convey my gratitude to the former President, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, who contributed immensely to the achievements of the previous session.
The United Nations now has a distinguished track record of 70 years. We at the United Nations have consistently engaged in the responsible and challenging task of working to ensure global peace, security and development during these past 70 years. However, I realize that similar challenges still lie ahead of us. When leaving office at the height of the Korean crisis in 1953, Mr. Trygve Lie, the first Secretary-General, described the position of Secretary-General as “the most impossible job in the world”. It is no secret that all Secretaries-General, during their terms of office, have contributed substantively to promoting the universality of the United Nations and to making it an Organization that can serve humankind well in to the future. The incumbent Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, has also made a remarkable contribution to the Organization. I would ask Secretary-General Ban
6/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
Ki-moon to accept my respectful gratitude and that of my people for the service he has rendered.
Sri Lanka has been a Member of the United Nations for 60 years. As a Member State, we have played a very active and responsible role in the Organization. Sri Lanka is a nation that respects the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international conventions and treaties. A main objective of the United Nations is to recognize, safeguard and promote human rights. Sri Lanka remains committed to fulfilling that responsibility. In that respect, we intend to implement a new programme and plan of action in Sri Lanka to advance human rights.
Sri Lanka has played a multifaceted role in the United Nations. Our contribution to United Nations peacekeeping missions, which began in the 1960s, continues. Sri Lanka looks forward to further enhancing our committed contribution to United Nations peacekeeping in the future.
A new era of democracy dawned in Sri Lanka on 8 January, ushering in justice, freedom and equality. Our social and human development approach is founded on pluralism, reconciliation and sustainable development. The development vision of my Government for the next five years is based on the same principles. The theme of this session — “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights” — is therefore very much in consonance with the vision of my Government. Moreover, my Government is committed to developing a proactive and practical programme in Sri Lanka to further ensure peace, security and human rights.
In the past eight months, in two consecutive elections, the people of Sri Lanka elected a new president and a new Government. In its first six months in power, my Government has introduced essential amendments to the Constitution in order to strengthen democracy in Sri Lanka. Those amendments have reinforced the foundations of good governance through institutional reforms that strengthen pluralism and democracy. With my personal involvement and facilitation, some of the executive powers vested in the presidency were transferred to the Parliament and other independent institutions.
Following the general elections in August, I was able to unite the two major political parties in Sri Lanka so as to create an alliance for governance by consensus in the country, changing the confrontational political
culture that had prevailed there for six decades. Our new vision for the country involves achieving the twin objectives of sustainable development and reconciliation. A fundamental requirement in that context is dealing with the past honestly and building a modern Sri Lankan nation. In dealing with the past, we will follow a process of truth-seeking, justice, reparation and non-recurrence.
It is imperative that Sri Lanka adopt a new social, economic and political approach, so that it can rise to the challenges of the twenty-first century. In that regard, reconciliation has received priority attention in my country. The new Government of consensus has, under my leadership, already taken several steps to introduce and operationalize the constitutional and institutional reforms required to accelerate the achievement of those goals. Sri Lanka is a country that has suffered from conflict. While conflict brings destruction to a society, it is possible for many lessons to be learned during and after a conflict.
All forms of war and terrorism are a disgrace to humankind. The Preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights refers to the disregard and contempt for human rights, which results in barbarous acts and ultimately rebellion. Whatever its root causes are, the challenge of this era is to find ways and means to defeat brutality against humankind. Problems can arise from resorting to terrorism as a means of solving grievances, as well as from actions taken to eliminate terrorism. Sri Lanka has succeeded in eliminating the terrorism that continues to disturb other developing countries from Asia to Africa and Latin America.
We defeated one of the world’s most ruthless terror enterprises. In addition, our post-conflict experiences have also been meaningful. We believe that all those experiences can be shared fruitfully with other developing countries affected by terrorism. Sri Lanka remains prepared to engage in a more active dialogue with such countries and will continue to speak and advocate against terrorism.
It is in that context that I wish to address the theme of this session. We all know that the United Nations was established with the objective of preventing the recurrence of the human tragedies that took place in the first half of the twentieth century and which had a negative impact on humankind. At the heart of this year’s theme is “peace, security and human rights”. That theme motivates us to review whether, during
15-29562 7/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
the past seven decades, we have lived up to the initial expectations of the United Nations. I believe that, if global development is to succeed, it is important to have a dialogue within the South as much as between the North and the South. My country, which lies in the South, can contribute immensely to nurturing such South-South dialogue.
Sri Lanka is in the forefront of the oldest representative democracies in the South Asian region. We have been fortunate in being able to preserve the democratic ethos in our country despite the prolonged conflict. Despite several factors militating against maintaining a high economic growth rate, we have succeeded in sustaining the State social-welfare policies carried over from independence. We have never compromised on those policies, which include universal free education, free health care and the eradication of poverty. Following a path of social democracy, Sri Lanka has succeeded in achieving high scores in the Human Development Index, even during the years of conflict. That success is testimony to our commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
Development should help to empower women and young people and ensure security for children. Frustration among the young usually leads to conflict. Yet young people are the driving force for sustainable development, and we should therefore work to transform them into a highly skilled workforce that can succeed in the knowledge-based world of the twenty-first century. That should be a major component of the post-2015 development agenda adopted in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).
Similarly, we should launch a national programme to empower women and thereby enhance their contribution to development. Special programmes to protect children and safeguard their rights are also an essential factor in developing an effective and humane society. My understanding of sustainable development is that we should aim not for a development model that is isolated and confined to particular sectors or groups, but one that is inclusive and capable of lifting development standards and levels globally. To that end, I would like to stress the need for a fresh, universal approach.
As we learn from the Buddhist ethos that is ingrained in Sri Lankan culture, there are three kinds of human conflict. The first is the conflict between humans and nature, in which we constantly engage in
order to enjoy material comforts in life. In that context human beings today attempt to exploit natural resources extensively in the name of development. The second is the conflict among humans. Such conflicts occur among individuals, communities and nations, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms that they occur when human rights are not protected by the rule of law. The third type of conflict is that within the human being. The first two kinds occur when we lose the battle within us as human beings, and the third type is therefore the root cause of all conflicts.
Extremism, overconsumption, the arbitrary exploitation of the environment, violations of human rights and vicious disparities in income are all results of our inability to overcome our cravings. Among other problems, they cause insecurity, conflict, violations of rights and exploitation. The edifice of sustainable development should, therefore, be built on a foundation of self-discipline and equity. If we could practise that at the personal, community, national and global levels, it would be a giant leap forward for humankind. I propose that we, as national leaders, take such a self- disciplined, equity-based approach into consideration when drawing up relevant action plans for the future.
In conclusion, I would like to express my firm commitment and dedication to elevating my beloved motherland of Sri Lanka and its people to the level of one of the greatest and noblest nations of the world, and contributing to the liberation of all humankind.
"
70,2015,SLV,"It is an honour to address the Assembly on this very important occasion, as we commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the international Organization, and we have entered a new phase related to the future of humankind by adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).
There is no doubt that the challenges that lie before us are enormous, and consequently we have need an Organization that is ever more democratic, participatory and effective. We must move forward in the still-pending reforms of the Organization. We must work with renewed vigour on that task, especially with regard to the Security Council. The adoption of the new Agenda imposes on our countries numerous challenges to which we are committed, but it also imposes challenges on the Organization, particularly with regard to providing us with timely support to fulfil the historic responsibility that we have assumed.
We have concluded a stage in world history marked by important progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. However, that progress has
not been sufficient. The fight against poverty and inequality goes on. Economic and financial crises have aggravated the vulnerability of the poorest. In addition, the proliferation of conflicts throughout the world and natural and human-made disasters have had an impact on the living conditions of many people in various parts of the world. Those conditions demand that we bring about a genuine and sustainable global transformation, which must include the restructuring of the international financial architecture, as well as a rethinking of cooperation mechanisms with a view to transforming them into transparent and efficient mechanisms that meet the needs of human development.
I believe that we must pay special attention to the issue of sovereign debt. The negative impact of debt servicing on development needs and on the effective enjoyment of human rights in our countries is enormous, because it directly affects the capacity of the State to generate public investment and stimulate private investment. That in turn impedes the fulfillment of the goals related to development. It is therefore a priority to establish a debt restructuring mechanism that promotes a just and shared distribution of responsibility between debtors and creditors by adopting an approach centred on human needs.
We know that for the success of the Sustainable Development Goals, a new vision of international cooperation is required. To that end, we must work to change the current structure of development financing and strengthen South-South cooperation without delay.

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
My country recognizes the importance of the fact that in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), adopted by the Sustainable Development Summit, special mention is made of migrants as a vulnerable group, and of their undoubted contribution to sustainable development in the countries in which they live. El Salvador insists that the international community, the organizations involved in migration issues, those defending migrants and human rights in general — but especially the United Nations — should take up the challenge with courage and guide the actions of their agencies, resources and programmes to strengthen cooperation initiatives in the field of international migration in all its facets. In the various migration crises we face, we must not lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with human beings, whose rights and development we should guarantee.
I take this opportunity to highlight the special contribution that Latin America and its regional organizations have made to multilateralism. Their valuable proposals and initiatives have contributed to promoting and making progress on issues that are very relevant to the international agenda, such as migration, the environment, disarmament, human rights, gender empowerment and equality, and sustainable development, among others. All of the efforts that we have undertaken as a region have been extremely valuable in the progress of the multilateral agenda, and they have been aimed at strengthening solidarity and cooperation among the peoples of the world.
In that context, we should mention the regional efforts made by the Central American Integration System, particularly in the area of security, which complement the regional efforts and the national efforts undertaken by each of our countries.
In the area of security, as members know, El Salvador is waging an unprecedented war against organized crime through its El Salvador Seguro plan, which, like the Central American Security Strategy, has four main components: crime prevention, crime prosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration, and the strengthening of the institutions that fight crime. We have committed a major part of our national resources to this effort, but the scope of the challenge forces us to come to the international community to request its strong support and solidarity, so that we may win this good fight against criminal groups that threaten the peace of our families.
Moreover, in relation to the global drug problem, I wish to emphasize the coming special session of the General Assembly on drugs, to be held next April in this Hall. The special session in 2016 will give us an opportunity to revitalize the dialogue and exchange good experiences so that we can assess the progress made in complying with our international obligations to combat drugs and to work at the same time on the challenges to be overcome at the global level.
El Salvador is pleased and honoured, as the coordinator of the Latin American and Caribbean Group, to have the opportunity to represent the Latin American region at meetings of the preparatory committee for that event. We will seek close and effective coordination so that the debates and dialogues move towards the definition of a comprehensive vision of an international policy against drugs based on the welfare of the individual and respect for his or her rights.
Furthermore, in the context of the importance that my country attaches to controlling the arms trade as an effective means of reducing the violence plaguing Central America, El Salvador supportsrelevant international regulation to combat organized crime so as to prevent the human suffering caused by irresponsible transfers of weapons. I fervently appeal to the international community to work together on the effective implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty and its universalization. Let us not forget that decisive action in that area means nothing less than the difference between life and death for thousands of individuals in the world.
At the same time, El Salvador, as a country that has benefited from peacekeeping operations, recognizes that mechanism as a legitimate and effective measure for ending conflicts in countries and regions. On that count and as part of our staunch commitment to peace and international security, my country will continue to participate in United Nations peacekeeping missions through its contributions of military and police personnel. We will continue to work to strengthen our participation by deploying units under their own flag. We also support all the initiatives aimed at ensuring the participation of women in the various contingents, as provided for in Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and subsequent Council resolutions.
In conclusion, I wish to recall the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We
2/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
must be aware that they are still valid and should be respected by all Member States in the process of change that we have begun.
In that context, we should also mention the process of detente that has begun between Cuba and the United States of America, a process that has had a positive impact not only on the relations between the two countries, but also on the continent as a whole. El Salvador is pleased with the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States of America and trusts that in the current favourable climate, the will expressed to lift the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba will become a reality as soon as possible.
I am convinced that with a will and with effort, we can all build an international order based on promoting peace, security and sustainable development, protecting human rights, eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities. E1 Salvador stands ready to face that challenge and is committed to working to that end.
"
70,2015,JAM,"It is an honour for me to address this historic seventieth session of the General Assembly. I extend to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft my sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the Assembly. We feel confident that under his capable
guidance, this session will inspire what he has called for in this seventieth year — a new commitment to action for international cooperation towards peace, security, human rights and economic justice for all persons.
I also express Jamaica’s profound gratitude to the outgoing President, His Excellency Sam Kutesa of Uganda, for his outstanding stewardship during what has been a truly defining year for the United Nations.
As we mark the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the Organization, let us reflect on its value and work over the decades. We concede that the United Nations is by no means perfect. Yet we shudder to contemplate the kind of world that would have emerged from the ravages of the Second World War without its existence. We recognize the commendable role played by the United Nations in various fields, from peacekeeping, human development and the protection of human rights, to the codification of international law and environmental sustainability. We also value and commend the work of the specialized agencies for their impressive achievements in agriculture, population studies, labour, industrial development, health and culture, among many other areas of pursuit. It is a record of which the international community can be justly proud.
At the same time, we acknowledge that the overall results have been mixed as we have fallen short of our expectations in some key areas. Today, our world continues to be plagued by poverty and strife, which place too many people in vulnerable situations. Suffering and inequality remain widespread and too many are marginalized and left behind. To tackle these challenges we must heed the call to do more and to do better. This is an historic moment and we must use it to muster our collective will to imbue this seventieth session with a firm determination to make the eighth decade in the life of our Organization a period of unparalleled achievement. Let us prioritize action over rhetoric.
Last week, we adopted the most comprehensive, universal global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) the world has yet seen. We have great expectations of the 2030 Agenda, but they will not be met without determined effort, the exercise of political will and the forging of genuine and durable partnerships between and among all States. We must also marshal the resources required at the
8/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
national, regional and international levels to increase the likelihood of success.
The challenge posed by climate change is an existential one for the peoples of small island developing States (SIDS), whose lives and livelihoods too often hang in the balance. We therefore look for the continued support of the international community for SIDS. A key part of our work will be to ensure that, as we implement the new development paradigm, we fully address the unique vulnerabilities of SIDS, and the persistent economic and social challenges of countries in special situations, such as middle income countries. This must include the adoption of approaches to measuring development that reflects the realities of our countries.
In yet another reminder of the devastating and disproportionate impact of natural disasters on SIDS, our sister island of Dominica is currently struggling to recover from the ravages of tropical storm Erika. Jamaica joins the appeal to the international community to rally in support of the people of Dominica by assisting in the recovery, reconstruction and humanitarian efforts that are required. It is an unfortunate fact that such events will certainly occur again. In fact, another member of our Caribbean family, the Bahamas, is now being pummelled by Hurricane Joaquin. In spite of this fact, however, the international community can ensure the impact of the next natural disaster on our small island and low-lying coastal countries is lessened by helping us to improve our resilience in the face of these ever increasing calamities.
We firmly believe that the successes recorded by the Organization over the past years have reinforced the value of multilateralism as the best framework for tackling global problems. The adoption of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda are recent examples of our commitment to collective action. The next major step for multilateralism will come in a few weeks when we hope to conclude negotiations in Paris on a global agreement on climate change. We must capitalize on the momentum that we have generated throughout this year and work in concert to make the climate Conference a success for us all. The sustainability of our planet and the prosperity of our peoples depend on a meaningful outcome. We can and we must deliver for present and future generations.
Our deep concern about climate change underscores the urgent need to protect our oceans and seas. As host of the International Seabed Authority, Jamaica views with considerable interest developments that impact the preservation and sustainable use of the resources of the ocean for the benefit of mankind. We urge greater vigilance by all. Let us prioritize sustainable development over short-term goals.
The maintenance of international peace and security remains a most urgent and demanding objective of this body. While we have avoided a war of global scale over the past 70 years, today we face increasingly complex, interconnected threats to our peace and security. Intra-State conflicts and terrorist activities have transformed the geopolitical landscape and increased the threats to international peace and security. In his annual report the Secretary-General (A/70/1), points to some alarming developments in which millions of people are engulfed by conflict and crisis, most notably in the Middle East and North Africa. Millions suffer the brutal tactics of violent extremists such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab.
Transnational organized crime and the presence of weapons of mass destruction continue to threaten international peace and security, while the proliferation of conventional arms in the hands of non-State actors pose a grave risk to many countries and regions. In the face of these crises, our peoples look to the United Nations to find solutions to end human suffering. Yet, the Organization has been impotent to respond in many of these situations, calling its credibility and relevance into question.
We must admit that traditional peace and security responses have to date proven grossly inadequate in the face of today’s diverse conflicts. With that in mind, Jamaica welcomes the Secretary-General’s timely initiative to review and assess the peacekeeping architecture undertaken by the eminent United Nations High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations. We commend the resultant comprehensive agenda and robust action plan set out by the Secretary-General. As a proud police-contributing country, Jamaica is keen to participate in the forthcoming discussions within the General Assembly and in sharing the lessons learned and the ways we might use our enhanced understanding of the new contexts in which our peacekeepers are being deployed.
15-29822 9/29

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
We, the United Nations, must redouble our efforts to find new avenues for maintaining peace and security, through preventative approaches and the creation of durable solutions. Forging effective partnerships will be the key. History has shown us time and again that when the United Nations works with other actors within the international community, we can produce effective and enduring solutions to seemingly intractable challenges. As we move to decisively address threats to and breaches of international peace and security, I call on the Security Council to act more decisively to address these challenges. Let us prioritize peace over political expedience.
However, the Assembly continues to grapple with the urgent question of Security Council reform. Fortunately, the consensus decision of the sixty-ninth session is a call for the commencement of substantive, text-based negotiation during this historic seventieth session. That is a significant step forward and Jamaica is honoured to have made its contribution as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations during the past session.
Jamaica is well aware that in our region, as elsewhere, peace and development are inextricably linked. However, they can fall prey to rising social and political tensions, which too often culminate in conflicts. For that reason we are pleased that on the occasion of the second Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States held in Cuba in 2014, our Community proclaimed Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace.
Jamaica recognizes that it is through dialogue and mutual respect that we can begin to address many long- standing conflicts. We are therefore heartened to see the warming of relations between two of our closest neighbours and call on the United States Administration to take a further bold step by immediately lifting the unjust economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. The Group has further noted and welcomed the efforts of the Secretary-General to facilitate a solution to the controversy between the two countries. The importance of keeping diplomatic channels open and engaging in dialogue was reiterated.
Jamaica remains concerned about the ongoing border controversy between Guyana and Venezuela. We therefore welcome the recent decision of our two neighbours to resume diplomatic dialogue with a view to bringing the controversy to an early end.
The conflict-fuelled humanitarian crises unfolding throughout the world, particularly in the Middle East, North Africa, the Mediterranean, and into Central Europe, require our urgent attention. So too do the humanitarian crises that impact people living in areas prone to natural disasters.
It is unthinkable that we should tolerate the immense suffering of millions, including vulnerable women and children. Let us be our brothers’ keeper and reach out in the universal and timeless spirit of “one love” so poignantly championed by Jamaica’s musical icon, the late Bob Marley. It is Jamaica’s hope that the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 will signal a turning point in how we, the global community, treat with such crises in order to contain and reverse their effects, and where possible prevent their occurrence.
I now turn to the area of disarmament and arms control, which is in danger of becoming a neglected and forgotten goal of the United Nations. Sadly, the disarmament machinery has been languishing in a state of paralysis for the past 19 years. The vast expenditures on weapons and military equipment of all kinds, which consume a massive share of the world’s resources, could be more properly channelled into the development agenda that we have just adopted. By so doing, the world would not only be more prosperous, it would also be much safer and more secure.
We are disheartened that the international community has failed to seize the opportunity provided by the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to make significant progress on its commitment to ridding the world of nuclear weapons. We must invigorate our disarmament efforts through new and more effective approaches. Jamaica therefore supports efforts to address the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons and joins the strong call for the negotiation of a legally binding instrument to prohibit their use, which is embodied in the recent humanitarian pledge endorsed by 114 States.
Of immediate concern to Jamaica is the proliferation of firearms of every description that endanger the lives of ordinary citizens, undermines the rule of law, threatens economic and social stability and fuels violent crime. Those who manufacture such weapons must exercise greater controls and support anti-proliferation efforts. The Arms Trade Treaty, which entered into force less than a year ago, can make a significant
10/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
contribution to such efforts. We are therefore pleased that the recent convening of the first Conference of States Parties has laid the foundation for the full and effective implementation of the Treaty. Let us prioritize vision over short-term gain.
The promotion of human rights is a major pillar on which the United Nations was founded. We must remain resolute in our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, knowing that every human being is equal in value and dignity and endowed with inalienable rights. In too many circumstances, the rights of the most vulnerable are treated with scant regard. Children are often exposed to a climate of violence and face persistent abuse; they are exploited and trafficked; used as labour and denied their fundamental rights. We must continue to take stronger action to protect our children and to safeguard their rights.
Persons with disabilities also face disproportionate hardships that hinder their ability to contribute effectively to their communities and societies. Jamaica is pleased to have recently passed its landmark Disabilities Act, which seeks to ensure that we fulfil our obligations to meet the needs and development aspirations of this important community. Across the world, we ought to make greater efforts to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities. We therefore welcome the higher number of ratifications of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities over the past year.
Too many women continue to face gross violations of their human rights. Too many are victims of trafficking, violence and discrimination, of unequal treatment before the law, and of subjugation and domination. I applaud the active efforts of UN-Women to realize women’s human rights. Jamaica is proud of its long-standing social legislation and its record of championing the rights of women, even as we recognize that more remains to be done, in keeping with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.
Racism, xenophobia and other forms of racial intolerance must also be rooted out in order to help create a more level playing field for all peoples. The launch of the International Decade for People of African Descent last December was a welcome development in our collective efforts to address these issues. In this regard, I call upon Member States to ensure the full implementation of its programme of activities.
On the grounds of the United Nations now stands The Ark of Return, a monument erected in honour of the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. Jamaica and its Caribbean Community partners in tandem with the African Union spearheaded this initiative with the generous support of the membership. For those who may not have had an opportunity to view it, I would urge you all to spend what will prove to be a worthwhile few moments of reflection at this memorial. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the message of the memorial, that there is no place for racial discrimination in our world, continues to be passed on from generation to generation. Let us prioritize people over power.
In this seventieth year, let us reaffirm our commitment to the guiding principles of this Organization and place them firmly at the core of our efforts to attain our shared goals and objectives: sovereign equality of States, great and small; observance of fundamental human rights; the equal rights of men and women; respect for the rule of law and the Charter of the United Nations; the promotion of social progress and better standards of life for everyone; and a firm belief that diplomacy, not force, should be our recourse in the quest to resolve conflicts and advance development. Let us therefore prioritize our commitment to action, with renewed fervour and determination. In this noble endeavour I pledge Jamaica’s unwavering support and action.
"
70,2015,DJI,"At the outset, allow me to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, as well as his country, the Kingdom of Denmark, on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. With his wisdom and experience, I am confident that he will successfully steer the proceedings of the Assembly. I assure him of my delegation’s cooperation and support.
I would also like to extend my heartfelt thanks to His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, who has just concluded his mission as President of the Assembly at its sixty- ninth session. Mr. Kutesa worked tirelessly to promote the work of the General Assembly and we are grateful to him for his dedicated service.
Finally, I would like to thank our Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership, dedication and personal commitment to advancing the agenda of the Organization.
I take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to the memory of His Excellency Mr. Roble Olhaye, Permanent Representative of the Republic of Djibouti to the United Nations and Ambassador of the Republic of Djibouti to the United States. My country and I myself have lost a brother and a great patriot. The United Nations family has also lost a colleague and a friend. The late Roble Olhaye was the epitome of a seasoned and experienced diplomat. His background is impressive; his life rich in teachings and his success immense. I would like to particularly emphasize his constant struggle for economic and commercial development for the African continent. He represented our country and all of Africa with pride. The grief and
sorrow we feel today following his death are alleviated by the many expressions of respect and compassion we have received from around the world. He be profoundly missed by all. May God Almighty welcome him into his eternal paradise.
It is a great honour for me to take the floor before the Assembly of peoples to celebrate, with men and women of all countries, races, languages and cultures, the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. When the Charter of the United Nations was drafted in 1946, it sent a message of hope for tomorrow from one of the darkest chapters in human history. It symbolized, in fact, the international community’s aspiration for peace and cooperation. This year, we celebrate not only the seventieth birthday of our beloved Organization, which is a historic date in itself, but also the twentieth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of the Millennium Declaration.
This is a crucial year that carries many hopes. Despite the sustained efforts made to achieve a world of prosperity, equity, freedom, dignity and peace for all people, we all know, unfortunately, we still have a long way to go. The international community undeniably remains faced with an unprecedented range of major challenges: poverty and hunger, persistent unemployment and violent armed conflict, and climate change. As recently as last year, we saw the health-care systems of brotherly countries being overwhelmed by new terrible threats, such as the Ebola virus, while new challenges have emerged constantly threatening peace and security. We will have the opportunity to return to this, but allow me now to address the implications of the macroeconomic fragility in the global economy, the many and varied challenges facing our country and the importance of establishing a credible and beneficial multilateral trading system for all.
The global economic and financial environment is more alarming than ever. The 2008 financial and economic crisis has had multidimensional consequences and many developing countries continue to face difficult macroeconomic situations. Any response designed to resolve this situation should take into account the special needs of Africa, and especially those of the least developed countries, and ensure that the commitments undertaken at international meetings can be implemented.
15-29568 9/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
In that regard, we continue to observe with concern the current difficulties faced by States members of the World Trade Organization in efforts to identify ways and means to overcome the impasse in the Doha Round of negotiations and establish a significant post-Bali programme of work. Major issues are at stake because it is our responsibility to build a credible multilateral trading system that enables everyone, in particular developing countries, to identify their objectives in the areas of industrialization and the structural transformation of their economies.
Climate change is not only the greatest challenge that humankind faces, but also the most important one of our day in terms of development. It threatens to undermine life for future generations. The many meetings on climate change and the lack of progress achieved illustrate the extent to which this issue is a source of controversy and division. It is true that our claims are legitimate and understandable. However, it is also true that Africa has more to lose than others. That is why we are ready to assume our responsibility to reduce our emissions and we hope that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities will be scrupulously respected.
Each region has its specificities and environmental concerns that are not necessarily the same as those of countries in other regions. My country is particularly exposed to many natural hazards, the most frequent and destructive being droughts and floods. The Republic of Djibouti, despite its marginal contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, is contributing to global efforts to fight against this devastating scourge. To that end, we recently hosted a conference in partnership with the Climate and Energy Institute of the prestigious Yale University, which has developed a very relevant climate model illustrating all the scenarios of the climate change impact on our region.
It is in this spirit that we proposed to establish and host in Djibouti a regional environmental observatory. Moreover, my country has for several years carried out a policy of renewable energy use with the stated goal of excluding fossil fuels by the year 2020. That is why, together with Ethiopia, we have already put in place a hydropower project and begun to use the tremendous potential of our country’s geothermal, wind, solar and tidal energy.
The environment is a cross-cutting and transnational element. Consequently and logically, we need cross-
cutting, transnational and interdisciplinary policies commensurate with the challenge. It is therefore time to adopt just, fair and scientific climate goals. We hope that the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will be held soon in Paris, will mark a decisive turning point.
Violent extremism is the product of a deadly ideology that openly advocates the destruction and elimination of others on behalf of a supposed religious belief, whereas Islam is a religion which essentially advocates openness, tolerance and love of one’s neighbour. Our region, East Africa, is one of the primary targets of terrorist attacks. Al-Shabaab poses a major threat to our region and is at the root of terrorist attacks and many attempted attacks in most countries of our region. This painful experience has enabled us to develop a knowledge of the workings, practices and strategies of terrorist groups, which deserves to be shared.
The causes that encourage the spread of the scourge of extremism and, in effect, terrorist groups, are deep and diverse. Cracks and fractures seen in the international security architecture and conflict zones in the Middle East and Africa, as well as economic hardship, extreme poverty and the perception, justified or not, of marginalization, all generate a feeling of uncertainty and a strong desire to belong that can make groups sensitive to the extremist rhetoric and lead to violent attacks. We all know the human costs and the countless security, economic and social problems that they bring about.
Yesterday, President Obama took the initiative to organize a summit on this topic, which concerns us all. We thank him for that because the international context shows us the need and relevance of such consultations on a daily basis. No country can fight this scourge alone, because terrorism knows no borders. To neutralize this threat, we must work together concretely and decisively. Strategies to combat and prevent extremist violence must be perfectly calibrated while also avoiding overreaction. They must be based on an analysis of the root causes and an understanding of the reasons driving extremism.
Governments, regional and international organizations, religious leaders and leaders of academia and civil society must join forces to strengthen resilience in the face of terrorism and establish security and stability
10/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
in our countries. In that regard, my country will soon create, within the framework of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, a centre of excellence to combat violent extremism. The centre will seek to strengthen the capacities of governmental and non-governmental actors and provide a space for dialogue and a platform for the exchange of information among researchers and specialists.
Since 2008, the Member States represented in this Hall have witnessed the tense and so far unresolved situation prevailing in the north of my country following the unjustified and incomprehensible occupation by Eritrean forces of part of our territory. Members of my Government and I have come here on several occasions to brief the international community about the situation and to inform it about the unreasonable behaviour of Eritrea, which continues to ignore the gravity of the situation and reject any attempts at discussion. To resolve this conflict peacefully, my country, from the beginning, has sought out the good offices of the African Union, the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the United Nations. We finally agreed to mediation by His Highness the Amir of the State of Qatar, in the belief that Eritrea would listen to reason, but that was in vain.
To date, more than five years after the signing of the mediation Agreement, we are still awaiting the demarcation of the border and the return of our prisoners of war. Despite the call to reason by the international community and the adoption of resolutions 1862 (2009), 1907 (2009) and 2023 (2011), Eritrea has refused to recognize the existence of Djiboutian prisoners, even though two of them have, fortunately, managed to escape. This attitude of denial, even after the return and the testimony of these prisoners, and the refusal of any discussion is contrary to international standards and conduct. It demonstrates the danger that this country represents for the region and the international community as a whole. My country has always managed to preserve peace and we believe in the virtues of dialogue and mediation. However, the territorial integrity of my country is non-negotiable.
With regard to Yemen, we are deeply concerned about the tragic situation currently facing that brotherly country and especially about the deterioration of the humanitarian situation, which has been catastrophic since the beginning of the conflict. The Republic of Djibouti reaffirms its solidarity with the Yemeni
people and has taken all necessary measures to assist and welcome the displaced people fleeing the fighting.
The situation prevailing today in Yemen is the result of the refusal of the rebellion to accept and respect the political transition period, as negotiated during the National Dialogue process. By taking up arms, they have wrought havoc in this country and have forced the legitimate President to leave the country. We condemn the actions of the rebellion and especially the threats that these elements pose to the unity, integrity, stability and sovereignty of Yemen. In addition, the escalating violence in Yemen is a grave threat to the security and stability of the region and opens up a new front of radicalization, including the rise in power of Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula along our eastern border, which poses a distinct threat to my country throughout the Bab-al-Mandab strait.
In this connection, we welcome the military intervention of brotherly countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, led by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, at the request of President Hadi Mansour. We thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and, through him, Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, his Special Envoy for Yemen, for their dedication and the tireless efforts they have shown since the beginning this conflict. We ask the United Nations to redouble its efforts and the activities of its good offices to enable the resumption of a peaceful political transition process because the settlement of the crisis in Yemen requires dialogue. Lastly, we urge all Yemeni parties to participate in good faith in the dialogue being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations.
Despite the difficulties and daily obstacles of which we are all aware, Somalia has made significant progress, most notably in federal training and the establishment of regional administrations and an independent National Electoral Commission. However, the Somali Government still faces significant challenges. It is clear to us that rebuilding Somalia depends on guaranteeing a stable security environment. Of course, over the past two years, great progress has been made on the ground, but the extremist threat remains in view of the increase in attacks in recent months. The attack on 26 July against Jazeera Hotel is proof of that.
Such attacks have demonstrated that the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) needs the support of the Somali security forces. I therefore reiterate our belief that establishing a properly equipped, trained
15-29568 11/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
and led Somali army that, above all, benefits from the necessary financial support is imperative. Indeed, the project to integrate armed elements into a regular force capable of responding to threats to the unity and territorial integrity of Somalia should, in my view, be a priority for the Somali Government and for the international community. I take this opportunity to commend the tireless efforts and heavy sacrifices made by AMISOM troops and Somali forces, despite the gravity of the security situation.
We feel the scale of the Palestinian suffering in our very being. We are all aware that, after more than half a century of tragedy and resistance, the Palestinian people continue to suffer from the Israeli occupation and to live in inhumane conditions before our eyes. Each time a glimmer of hope of resuming peace negotiations appears, the Israeli State puts an end to it by resuming the building of new settlements. We, as Governments and members of the General Assembly, have a moral duty and political responsibility to say “no” and to give these brotherly Palestine people the right to be free from occupation, the right to live in dignity and peace and the right to aspire to the goals that each and everyone of us has. An independent and viable Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital and full membership of the United Nations, is an imperative for peace and stability in that region and will change the course and image of history.
It is undeniable that we are now at a crucial moment in the history of our Organization and that the world in which we live is very different from that of 1945. It is also undeniable that this evolution requires us to adapt to new and changing realities. In that regard, the revitalization of the General Assembly and Security Council reform are paramount. We welcome, in this regard, the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 69/321 on the revitalization of its work. Following the landmark achievement of the founding fathers of creating the United Nations, we must tirelessly pursue our quest to fulfil all the promises contained in their visions.
With regard to Security Council reform, it is imperative that at the start of the seventieth anniversary of the Organization, the African continent, which has the largest number of countries, have a permanent voice in the conduct of international affairs. That is why my country reiterates its full commitment to the conclusions of the Summit of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State, held on 9 May in Livingstone,
Zambia, in particular the need to continue promoting the Africa Common Position on United Nations reform and on preserving the unity of the Group of African States. Over 15 years after its adoption, the Ezulwini Consensus remains relevant, especially in this context where African issues are more than ever on the Security Council’s agenda.
"
70,2015,SLE,"I would like to warmly congratulate the President on his election to conduct the affairs of the Assembly at its historic seventieth session. I can assure him of my personal support and that of Sierra Leone during his tenure. I would also like to convey my sincere appreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa of the Republic of Uganda, for the effective way in which he led the previous session. And I heartily commend the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his constructive leadership of our Organization. Sierra Leone will continue to support progressive implementation of his laudable Five-Year Action Agenda, announced on 25 January 2012. We also welcome his synthesizing report on the work of the Organization (A/70/1), which articulates a call to action to transform our world beyond 2015.
Seventy years ago, we committed to promoting social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. Today, that is still our task and common goal, and the very foundation in which our shared and common values are firmly embedded and should therefore be respected. It is in the pursuit of that task and our shared values that, 15 years ago, the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) articulated a bold vision to eradicate extreme poverty, promote gender equality and ensure that children everywhere receive a basic education. Together, we have achieved a lot, getting millions out of poverty, getting millions into schools and breaking down many barriers to the empowerment of women. But our achievements are works in progress, as is our Organization. Many challenges still remain.
Many actions need to be taken in the offices of our Organization, and many actions must be taken in the field where the citizens of the world lead their lives. The two are interlinked. Without changes within the structures of our global Organization, our actions in the field will be hindered by the lack of ownership, lack of inclusion and lack of irreversible successes. That is why we commend the President for the choice and relevance of the theme of this session: “The United Nations at 70 — a new commitment to action”. We have put forward negotiating positions for reform in our Organization, we have drawn up plans for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and we adopted the financing for development framework in Addis Ababa in July. What is left now for us to do is to take action on all these fronts: to continue action to reform our Organization, to commence action in areas
22/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
where there has not yet been action, to take action to overcome challenges, and to follow through on action to sustain, deepen and expand our achievements.
The unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals and its accompanying challenges are critical to the work that lies ahead. We have learned lessons that are invaluable, and we have made undeniable progress. But the challenges we still face are seen in the millions not going to school, the millions not having health care, the millions of women who are oppressed, and the millions of people whose rights and lives are being trampled upon in the war zones and on the refugee routes of the world. The challenges have the urgency of a life-and-death situation for millions.
What we see the world over — in the refugee crisis, in the fight against poverty, transnational organized crime, terrorism, proliferation of small arms and light weapons, piracy, violence against women, in our actions to uphold human rights, and in the efforts for expanding access to health and education — what we see are struggles to promote inclusion in the better achievements of humankind: achievements in the areas of security, safety, peace, education, health and development. Where there is exclusion, people seek inclusion. The poor seek inclusion in a fairer world, and refugees seek inclusion in a safer world. We believe that the SDGs are about building a fairer, safer and better world for those excluded from the great achievements of humankind.
Making our global Organization more democratic, more participatory and fairer is part of the struggle for inclusion the world over. It is a prerequisite for achieving our universal aspirations as expressed in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda (resolution 70/1). As the Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State and Government on the Reform of the United Nations Security Council, I take this opportunity to emphasize once again the need for urgent reform of the Council and again echo Africa’s concern over the failure of the General Assembly to adopt measures that will lead to a comprehensive reform of the Security Council.
I wish to call attention to the regrettable status quo that undermines the principles of equity, legitimacy, accountability and transparency. The current state of affairs also undermines the effectiveness of the Security Council in its pursuit of international peace and security. The need to address the issue of Africa’s
non-representation in the permanent category and its underrepresentation in the non-permanent category is long overdue and therefore now imperative. Africa’s demand for two permanent seats and two additional non-permanent seats as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration is just and provides a framework for a fairer and more inclusive United Nations. I welcome the recent adoption of resolution 69/321, designed, inter alia, to further the intergovernmental negotiation process, and I very much hope that meaningful progress will be made towards a consensus-building mechanism in the course of this seventieth session.
Sierra Leone is very committed to promoting inclusion in governance and in development and to furthering peace around the world. We shall continue to support initiatives to sustain and expand democracy, peace and security, in Africa in particular, and in the world at large. The contribution of Sierra Leone to United Nations peacekeeping efforts demonstrates our strong commitment to global peace and stability. We acknowledge the report of the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations on uniting our strengths for peace: politics, partnership and people (A/70/95). We stand ready to explore further ways of increasing our contribution to global peacekeeping in order to enhance the success of United Nations peacekeeping operations. I take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the men and women in uniform, as well as to civilian staff, who continue to make the ultimate sacrifice to serve humankind in complex and dangerous environments around the world. We totally condemn attacks against United Nations peacekeepers, and we call for action against the perpetrators of these cowardly acts.
The report of the Advisory Group of Experts for the 2015 Review of the United Nations Peacebuilding Architecture and its recommendations is a useful document that informs us of lessons learned, best practices and the challenges ahead in terms of preventing relapses into violent conflict. We look forward to constructive engagement in the intergovernmental process in the light of the fact that Sierra Leone is one of the case studies and a storehouse of lessons learned.
We applaud our collective establishment of the Residual Special Court for Sierra Leone for the purpose of carrying out the continuing legal obligations of the original Special Court. Given the profile of persons convicted by the Court and those currently serving prison sentences under the supervision of the Residual
15-29431 23/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
Court, it is in the interest of international peace and security and in furtherance of justice that we extend support to the effective operations of the Residual Court in order to enable it to fully deliver on its mandate.
Whether it be terrorism, climate change, disease or refugees, no country is immune from the challenges facing the world at large. Some countries may be able to keep some of these problems from reaching their shores. However, our globalized world has multiplied the routes along which these challenges move, going from country to country, from one region to another, from one group of people to another. That is why we cannot say a particular problem is only a problem for this country or that region. Poorer countries suffer disproportionately from particular problems but, without support from the world to solve them, the problems spread and haunt other regions, other countries and other groups. We need to incorporate that piece of wisdom into decision-making in every country, every region and every global organization.
That is also the piece of wisdom we need to incorporate into our decisions about climate change. Changes in the weather patterns in the Pacific and in the ocean currents of the North Atlantic are unleashing devastating floods in many places. A week and a half ago, we witnessed floods of proportions hitherto unseen in Sierra Leone, which devastated many parts of our capital, Freetown. Storms rage in the Cape Verde Islands and floods have ravaged other parts of West Africa. We believe that our experts are right when they attribute those disasters to man-made climate change.
We call for action, not only to lower emissions of greenhouse gases, which are implicated in those changes, but also to shore up capabilities to deal with the effects of climate change. No country, I reiterate, is immune from the physical, social, health and other consequences of climate change. We need to integrate that insight into our decisions about other urgent matters — youth unemployment, insecurity, extreme hunger, violence against women, transnational organized crime and piracy. Allowing these to get out of control in vulnerable nations increases the vulnerability of all nations.
Africa has made efforts to strengthen the continent’s capacity for preventing and resolving conflicts. Countries in the global South have also been at the forefront of finding solutions and providing relief from the miseries of the world. They host more refugees
than other lands; they contribute more personnel to peacekeeping missions. Global solidarity is imperative in building our regional capacity to better handle those challenges. Without that solidarity, the challenges will jump across borders, evade immigration controls and leap over walls. That is why we need cooperative and coordinated partnerships to strengthen the capacities to respond to those challenges. Our voice, as fragile and conflict-affected States under the Group of Seven Plus, is a call for country ownership and country-led implementation of the SDGs.
Since 2012, Sierra Leone has been proactively tailoring its development framework in anticipation of the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). The implementation of our national vision for socioeconomic development, as contained in the Government’s poverty reduction strategy paper and articulated in the Agenda for Prosperity, was launched in July 2013 as Sierra Leone’s road map for the post-2015 development agenda. The Agenda for Prosperity aims to build a sustainable future for all Sierra Leoneans. It demonstrates our firm commitment to putting Sierra Leone on the path to resilience and sustainability.
To that end, we have recorded significant progress in strengthening political and economic governance, including the improvement of social indicators. My Government has continued to place emphasis on the protection of the basic rights of the people of Sierra Leone. We have put in place comprehensive reforms in the justice sector, in response to both national and global demands, to ensure that the rights of citizens are preserved and that access to justice is accorded to all. The Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone is closely collaborating with the Government to ensure that a human rights culture is entrenched in our society and that the Government ratifies several international treaties and protocols whose ratification is still outstanding and fulfils its various reporting obligations.
We have undertaken specific reform measures to improve the national investment climate. My Government is keen on delivering results in several priority areas, including infrastructure development, commercial agriculture, improved access to education and health-care services, youth empowerment and employment, women’s empowerment, effective and efficient public service delivery and the social and political integration of persons with disabilities.

At a time when Sierra Leone was being commended for its remarkable progress with respect to peace, stability and steady economic growth, we were hit by the unprecedented Ebola virus outbreak, which took a heavy toll on the entire socioeconomic fabric of Sierra Leone. However, we fought back, with support from our international friends, and have now almost defeated the evil virus, with zero cases being recorded for several days in September. As we make progress to end the epidemic, I wish to commend the United Nations agencies and the international community for their support and their commitment to ending the epidemic, as well as their support for the post-Ebola recovery plan.
I particularly commend the Secretary-General for mobilizing, for the very first time, a coordinated and integrated United Nations system intervention to support countries affected by the outbreak of the Ebola virus disease in our region. In addition to containing the epidemic, the intervention of the United Nations and our partners has resulted in an enhanced preparedness to respond to similar outbreaks in the future. That is a useful model that can be applied to contain and tackle pandemics wherever they may surface. In order to guarantee a lasting recovery, my Government, in collaboration with our sister Republics of Guinea and Liberia, have also formulated a subregional post-Ebola socioeconomic recovery plan to ensure that the three most Ebola-affected countries return to the path of stability and prosperity.
The Sierra Leone National Recovery Plan is based on two main pillars. The first pillar concentrates on immediate recovery activities, including maintaining zero infections. The second pillar focuses on building resilient and sustainable national systems , including a viable health system, and establishing an integrated national security and disaster risk management system.
I must state, with a considerable measure of satisfaction, that the international community’s commitment to supporting the Ebola recovery plans has been very encouraging. On behalf of the Government and the people of Sierra Leone, allow me, Sir, to once again applaud our development partners for their unwavering commitment of support to Sierra Leone’s development aspirations. Sierra Leone is poised and ready to continue working with the international community to resume its pre-Ebola development trajectory. We look forward to strengthening our partnerships for the effective
implementation of our post-Ebola recovery plans, both national and subregional.
In conclusion, as our noble Organization celebrates its seventieth anniversary this year, it is important to reflect on the Charter, which reaffirms
“faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large or small”.
With the commitment of leaving no one behind, we must objectively follow a pragmatic approach, with renewed vigour and resolve, to provide a future for our people that will guarantee justice, sustainable peace and security, accountability and democratic governance, employment opportunities, the transparent and equitable distribution of wealth, a safe and sustainable environment, improved health and relevant education. It is also important to ensure that conflicts are resolved around the world, if the Sustainable Development Goals are to be achieved, as no development can take place without peace.
Together, let us rise to that challenge with greater resolve, and take action to create a fairer, safer and better world.
"
70,2015,TUR,"I bring warm greetings and hope that the seventieth session of the General Assembly will prove most fruitful.
I would like to congratulate Mr. Mogen Lykketoft on his assumption of the presidency. I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to Mr. Sam Kutesa for his time and efforts as President of the General Assembly at the sixty-ninth session.
Seventy years ago, our Organization was created — in the words of former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld — “not to take mankind to heaven, but to save humanity from hell”. Looking back, the United Nations has been instrumental in averting another and even deadlier world war. But it has failed to prevent people from suffering the pains of hell in many regional conflicts, including those of Bosnia, Rwanda and, over the past four years, Syria.
The tragic story of 3-year-old Aylan should serve as a reminder of what the United Nations should stand for. Just earlier this month, Aylan’s tiny, lifeless body washed ashore after the boat he was on capsized
in the Aegean. His family was trying to escape the indiscriminate barrel bombs in his town somewhere in Syria, to an imagined land of hope anywhere in Europe. The Turkish policeman who found Aylan said that he felt not like an officer on duty, but like the little boy’s father, helplessly holding his beloved son. Indeed, Aylan was our baby; he belonged to each and every one of us and to all humankind. From the moment that we found him, washed ashore and lifeless, we were each plunged into the misery of our own conscience.
We human beings are not merely blank pages in the book of history. We are all capable of both the best and the worst. This is a simple but powerful fact of our existence that can make us bring our best to the fore. We must join our efforts, no later than today, to effectively deal with the increasingly complex and tragic facts facing humanity. For its part, Turkey has assumed more than its fair share of the burden. Providing protection to more than 2 million Syrians and 200,000 Iraqis, Turkey now shelters the largest number of refugees in the world. Our doors will remain open. We embrace those fleeing war and persecution. So far, we have invested almost $8 billion, of which international contributions account for a mere $417 million. To date, 66,000 Syrian babies have been born in Turkey. Some 9 million medical consultations and 280,000 surgical operations have been provided to our Syrian refugee population. Currently, 230,000 school-age Syrian children are receiving a formal education and 460,000 more will be integrated into our education system by the end of the year.
The number of would-be illegal migrants who have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea has reached a staggering 6,000.Meanwhile, 55,000 seaborne migrants have been rescued by the Turkish Coast Guard, while 235,000 illegal entrants have been intercepted by Turkish law enforcement agencies since 2011. More than 4 million Syrians have fled chemical weapons, missiles and indiscriminate aerial bombardment by the Assad regime and ground assaults by the terrorist organization Daesh. And more than 12 million internally displaced persons, almost half of them children, are in desperate need of help.
This tragedy will not end before the people of Syria have a legitimate Government that truly represents their will and enjoys their full consent. Until then, the international community must act swiftly to protect them in their homeland, including by creating a safe zone beyond the reach of aerial bombardment by the
15-29562 31/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
regime and ground assault by Daesh and other terrorist organizations. Anyone hoping to solve the Syrian crisis must think of a Syria without Assad, a vicious tyrant who indiscriminately kills his own people with chemical weapons and barrel bombs. Every minute he remains in power adds to the shame of those who support him. As the world must realize, a diplomatic solution to the crisis should be based on a transition that will lead to political change. Turkey will continue to work towards that end.
People may no longer hear the voices of the 300,000 who have lost their lives so far. But last week I met with representatives of the thousands who dared to walk hundreds of miles to Edirne, Turkey, the last stop on their journey to their imagined land of hope in Europe. I promised to bring their voice to the world community. I have fulfilled my promise, yet our responsibility remains.
Indeed, it was with that sense of responsibility that we proposed the inclusion of item 130, “Global awareness of the tragedies of irregular migrants in the Mediterranean basin with specific emphasis on Syrian asylum-seekers”, in the agenda of the seventieth session. Our proposal was accepted by the General Assembly on 18 September. We will therefore have the chance to look at viable responses to the migrant tragedy in the form of partnerships between countries of origin, destination and transit. That is now a priority matter for all humankind.
The people of Syria are not the only ones to suffer. The Palestinian tragedy continues unabated. In my address to this body on 29 November 2012 (see A/67/PV.44), I called on the international community to stand in solidarity with the Palestinians in their bid for their own independent State, for which they have been calling for more than 60 years. Today, we finally witness and salute the Palestinian flag flying at full mast at the United Nations alongside those of all other States. That constitutes another significant step towards enabling the parties to come together on an equal footing at the negotiating table in a process aimed at achieving an equitable and sustainable peace.
The State of Palestine will be independent today or tomorrow, and East Jerusalem, Al-Quds Al-Sharif, will be its capital, As President Mahmoud Abbas just said, the Palestinian flag will be raised in Al-Quds Al-Sharif soon, and we will be there to celebrate that event together. All Muslims and Christians and all nations
will freely gather there. The city of Al-Quds matters for the whole of humankind. It is a city that is sacred to Islam, Judaism and Christianity, and should be treated accordingly. The expansion of illegal settlements and the violations targeting the holy sites, Al-Haram Al-Sharif and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in particular, must immediately and unconditionally stop, if we are to talk about a peace process. The holiness of Al-Haram Al-Sharif must be respected. We strongly reject and condemn attempts to establish a temporal and spatial division of Al-Haram Al-Sharif, which is in clear violation of international law.
Members have just heard the statement of His Excellency President Abbas. For us too, Palestine is an indivisible whole, consisting of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza. The right of Palestinians to live together as one must be recognized. As an integral part of the State of Palestine, Gaza should be freed from the illegal and inhumane blockade of the past eight years. Turkey’s commitment to providing the necessary political and economic support for the Palestinians to lead a dignified life will continue.
The current vacuum created on our southern borders as a result of the crisis in Syria has played into the hands of terrorists, who also target Turkey. This is a threat that has the potential to spread to the whole region and beyond. Terrorism has no justification. It should be condemned unconditionally. Any attempt to affiliate terrorism with any religion or ethnic group is patently misguided and serves only to strengthen the terrorist threat. Today, as in the past, Turkey is combating terrorism of all kinds, Daesh and the Kurdish Workers Party included. Our counter-terrorism efforts and our contribution to international cooperation to that end are well known to our partners. Daesh is a product of the vacuum created by the crisis in Syria. Fighting Daesh therefore means removing the conditions that created it. Hence, we will never succeed until Al-Assad goes. We dream of a new democratic multicultural Syria, both without Al-Assad and without Daesh. We expect our allies, partners and friends to continue to clearly and publicly display their support for and solidarity with Turkey in its fight against all types of terrorism.
The issue of foreign terrorist fighters is of utmost concern. According to United Nations figures, 25,000 foreign terrorist fighters are believed to be coming from over 100 countries. This threat needs to be addressed at its source. Enhancing international cooperation in terms of information exchange is crucial, but deficiencies in
32/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
this regard unfortunately continue. For our part, we have included more than 20,000 individuals in our no-entry list since 2011 and have deported more than 2,000 who are intending to reach conflict regions beyond our borders or are returning from them.
From Libya and Yemen to Ukraine, from South to North and from East to West, the global security environment is fragile. At a time of such volatility, particularly in our region, Turkey resolutely assumes responsibility in global issues, to the best of its abilities and within its means. Turkey has become a leading actor and a trustworthy partner with $3.5 billion dollars of official development assistance. We see a clear link between sustainable economic development and global stability. One way to ensure this is through inclusive economic growth where no one in our societies, including women and the vulnerable, is left behind. Today, half of the world’s population lives on a daily income of under $2.50, and close to 20,000 children die every day of hunger and poverty. Turkey, as the current President of the Group of 20 (G-20) since December 2014, has highlighted the importance of international cooperation, coordination and solidarity in addressing global uncertainties and risks. We have placed inclusiveness and overcoming inequality at the top of the G-20 agenda.
Our generation has witnessed the highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons since the Second World War. The great majority of today’s humanitarian crises are conflict-related. The global humanitarian system is running out of funds and affected people are running out of time. While Turkey hosts currently the largest number of refugees in the world, it also holds the Chair of the Global Forum on Migration and Development. Our overarching theme is: “Strengthening Partnerships: Human Mobility for Sustainable Development”. Our key priorities include promoting the positive linkages between migration and development. It is high time that we addressed the complex humanitarian agenda in a holistic manner, with a special emphasis on the humanitarian-development nexus. We therefore look forward to hosting the first ever World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul from 23 to 24 May next year.
Cultural divides will rob us of our future if we allow them to. The current conflicts around the world demonstrate the spread of hatred, discrimination and extremism. These crises result in the segregation of people with specific ethnic or religious backgrounds,
and they also hinder tolerance, coexistence and harmony among civilizations. We must avoid alienation, exclusion and the vilification of certain communities and religions if we want to bring down the walls that divide us. We must act together against all forms of racism and xenophobia, including Islamophobia, without exception. Only then can we collectively fight against extremism, radicalization and terrorism in an effective manner. We must encourage inclusiveness and democratic legitimacy, and must respect the people’s will and consent.
We cannot condone the prioritization of oppressive security vis-à-vis universal rights and freedoms that we have collectively undersigned at the United Nations. Our differences may remain, yet our collective abilities to overcome the divides must be strengthened. The United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, a project initiated nearly 10 years ago jointly by Turkey and Spain, aims to provide lasting solutions in that respect. There are many ways to respond to unfounded fear, mistrust and hatred in societies and among nations. Conflict is one. But there is a peaceful means of preventing and resolving conflicts: mediation. Turkey, together with Finland, launched the Mediation for Peace initiative at the United Nations five years ago. It has attracted considerable interest and yielded tangible results in heightening awareness of the importance of the peaceful resolution of conflicts.
We wish to see a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the principles of the Minsk agreements. Any solution to this conflict should also ensure the rights and security of the Crimean Tatars.
In terms of peace, security and prosperity in our entire neighbourhood, the South Caucasus has a prominent place. That region, regrettably, continues to be destabilized and weakened by three major unresolved conflicts in the greater area of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We are determined to continue our efforts to facilitate a peaceful resolution to these conflicts on the basis of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the inviolability of its internationally recognized borders. The same applies to Georgia, where we support unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty. We welcome the recent steps towards normalization and permanent stability in the Balkans. We therefore appreciate the progress made so far in the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue.
15-29562 33/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
Turkey is a part of Europe, historically and currently. On the basis of shared universal values, it continues to work towards its strategic objective of becoming a member of the European Union. We believe that today Europe needs Turkey more than ever to strengthen its security and prosperity.
Expanding relations and cooperation with Africa has become an important pillar of Turkey’s multifaceted foreign policy, which puts special emphasis on humanitarian diplomacy. We will continue to share our experience and knowledge with our African partners and friends on the basis of mutual benefit and in accordance with the principle of African solutions to African challenges.
In Asia, Turkey has been an integral part of the international efforts aimed at achieving a lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan. We firmly believe that the international community must continue its support to Afghanistan.
As I near the end of my remarks, I wish to draw the Assembly’s attention to our continuing commitment to a just, comprehensive and lasting solution in Cyprus. It must be based on the political equality of the two peoples and their equal ownership of the island. We expect a lasting settlement to be reached as soon as possible. And we support the efficient and constructive efforts of the Turkish Cypriot side to that end.
As the world population grows and is expected to reach 10 billion, the international community stands at the threshold of a critical period. Despite our many achievements, our need for a free, peaceful, stable, prosperous and just world continues. The road ahead for peace security and human rights will be paved with our good intentions. But most likely, our best intentions will not be sufficient to respond to the mounting challenges before us. We need a paradigm shift. The United Nations, as the ultimate global institution representing the vision of peace, must remain relevant and effective in coping with all the major challenges. Some of those challenges have already brought new tragedies upon us. Over the past 70 years, both the world and the United Nations have changed and evolved. However the change in the United Nations is not yet comprehensive enough to make it fully fit for purpose. Despite the major steps taken so far to adapt the Organization to the new global realities, any reform will remain incomplete unless it includes the Security Council.
Seventy years ago, the founders of the Organization entrusted it with the task of protecting the dignity, security and prosperity of all humankind. That task today requires the ability to take firm and decisive action against atrocities committed everywhere by aggressors and oppressors. The inability to do so not only will jeopardize the lives of millions affected by ongoing crises, it will threaten all future generations by calling into question the credibility of the United Nations system. The responsibility to reach the broadest possible consensus on comprehensive reform to render the Security Council more democratic, representative, inclusive, transparent, effective and accountable falls upon us all. We owe it not only to future generations but to the visionary founders of the Organization.
So, to add to Secretary-General Hammarskjöld’s vision of the United Nations as saving humankind, what now befalls this institution is the task of salvaging our shared future.
"
70,2015,CPV,"I would ask the indulgence of the Assembly that I may greet, on behalf of all Cabo Verdeans, all delegations to this seventieth session of the General Assembly and add our voice to all statements made here that call for the building of a better world. This session provides us with the opportunity, as we celebrate the anniversary of the United Nations with pride and joy, to engage in a critical and concrete reflection on the future of humankind and the challenges faced by the Organization. The theme chosen for this session could not be more timely and pressing: “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”.
Seven decades after the signing of the San Francisco Charter, it is incumbent on us to examine the road travelled so far as we identify new actions that will allow our Organization to grow in strength, unity and capacity in order to overcome challenges to international peace and security and make more concrete contributions to a bringing about a more just, equitable, sustainable and solidary world. Cabo Verde, which is celebrating the fortieth anniversary of its national independence this year, is among the countries that believe in the fundamental principles and goals of the United Nations and defend its purposes and principles, which continue to be fundamental and current for the Organization’s actions and serve as vital tools with which to build a common future.
We underline the crucial importance of reforming the United Nations in preparation for the road ahead. We urge all Member States to negotiate constructively with a view to agreeing on the revitalization of the powers of the General Assembly and reaching an understanding on the enlargement of the Security Council, which in our view should reflect the changes that have occurred in the world, with a more equitable and appropriate representation.
It was with great satisfaction that we participated in the Sustainable Development Summit 2015, which began this past 25 September. We take this opportunity to again declare Cabo Verde’s adherence to the principles contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and our full agreement with respect to the Sustainable Development Goals. The poorest and most vulnerable nations legitimately aspire to development, and we must all commit to achieving the goals that have been established for 2030.
16/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
Specifically with respect to the small island developing States, of which Cabo Verde is an example, some essential elements will have to be considered, namely, the threat to their survival posed by climate change, their particular vulnerability to natural disasters, the risk of losing their biodiversity, the reduced size of their markets, the high cost of transportation and energy infrastructure, and their difficulties in accessing financing. For all these reasons, they deserve special attention from the United Nations system in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a source of hope for the billions of human beings who aspire to a more just, equitable and inclusive world. The will to place people at the centre of development means that we must find appropriate instruments and consistent practices in a sustainable environmental framework.
In the light of the unequivocal correlation between sustainable development and climate change, Cabo Verde, like other small and vulnerable countries, hopes that the declarations and expressions of intent will translate into tangible commitments that lead to the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions but also provide a balanced approach to the issues of adaptation and mitigation. Meanwhile, the new agreement that is expected to be signed in Paris must not fail to give due weight to the issues of loss and compensation, development, technology transfer and capacity- building, and indicate clearly some reliable sources of financial support for the most vulnerable nations. We are firmly committed to assuming our responsibilities and making our contributions in that respect. In Cabo Verde, we have already established the goal of 100 per cent renewable energy and are on our way to achieving it, with international cooperation and United Nations monitoring. At this time, we have approximately 30 per cent renewable energy on the grid and believe that we will exceed 50 per cent by 2020.
Much to our consternation, serious cases of human rights violations are occurring in various parts of the world. It is unfortunate that, although almost seventy years have elapsed since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights saw the light of day, the promises made when that basic text was adopted have yet to be fulfilled. Cabo Verde is proud to serve as a benchmark in terms of freedoms, democracy, the rule of law, respect for and defence of human rights, and the promotion of human dignity.
Peace and security, together with political stability, are essential foundations for the development and the well-being of our peoples. We are therefore growing increasingly concerned about the spread of ongoing conflicts and tensions in Africa and the Middle East, which have caused thousands of people to flee, driven by total desperation. In seeking better living conditions, some find death instead. Those ongoing events have exposed the profound economic, social, political, environmental and humanitarian causes and ramifications of the crisis. The global refugee problem is a great challenge for humankind and requires the engagement of all. The scourge and stigma of war not only affect the well-being of peoples in their own countries, but also create broader instability, disrupting the development of entire regions. Cabo Verde joins those who call for the rapid settlement of the conflicts, based on a combination of collective efforts and respect for international law and, in particular, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.
The situation in the Middle East continues to deteriorate, with no end in sight to the various conflicts that are sweeping the region. The violations of human rights by the actors in the Syrian conflict, as well as the atrocities that are being perpetrated in the territories under the control of terrorist factions and religious fundamentalists, are a major cause for concern. The United Nations must redouble its efforts to reach negotiated solutions to that and other conflicts that offend our common sense of humanity. Resolving the problem of terrorism requires the international community to step up its actions in combating terrorism and extremism in all their forms and manifestations. We firmly condemn all expressions of terrorism and, in particular, the barbaric actions of extremist groups in the Middle East, Asia and Africa.
Because Cabo Verde is an archipelago nation, the sea plays a crucial role in the history, identity and subsistence of the people, providing vital natural resources and connecting the ten islands that form the archipelago. As a small island developing State, Cabo Verde relies on its partnership with the international community in confronting such maritime security challenges as those posed by trafficking and related crimes and in preserving and managing our seas.
I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to an exemplary action of regional cooperation in September 2014, when seven West African States, including
15-29658 17/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
Cabo Verde, notified the Secretary-General in a joint communication that we wished to extend the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond the distance of 200 nautical miles, pursuant to article 76 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Last August, we had the opportunity to make a technical presentation to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf and expect to receive a favourable response soon.
Cabo Verde welcomes the fact that a working group is studying issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction with a view to the development of a legally binding international convention (resolution 66/288, para. 162).
The world has great and renewed expectations for the Organization’s role not only in maintaining international peace and security, but also in promoting development and creating a more prosperous and unified international society by reducing injustice and inequities, eradicating poverty, promoting human rights and combating the effects of climate change. We do indeed believe that the United Nations is essential. A more sustainable world living in peace and security is possible.
"
70,2015,AZE,"At the outset, I should like to congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and to wish him every success in fulfilling that highly responsible duty. We are also grateful to Mr. Sam Kutesa for all his hard work in presiding over the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.
Over the past 70 years, the United Nations has decisively established itself as a universal Organization working for the noble cause of maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among States and achieving international cooperation. The ability of the United Nations to respond to a rapidly changing international environment by constant adaptation is remarkable. It gives us confidence to believe that the Organization will succeed in addressing the challenges it faces.
Azerbaijan condemns terrorism, violent extremism and separatism in all their forms and manifestations. In situations of armed conflict or political crisis involving inter-State relations, no solution can be reached that is inconsistent with international law and legal order — particularly where fundamental norms are concerned, such as the obligation to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of the internationally recognized borders of States.
With a view to contemporary developments, I have to express our deepest concern over the unfolding refugee crises fuelled by the armed conflicts in the Middle East and Africa. We are equally alarmed by increasing cases of religious intolerance, in particular Islamophobia, and attempts to associate religions with terrorism.

Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Azerbaijan is making concrete contributions to the activities of the United Nations. For more than 15 years, my country has been participating in United Nations-mandated peacekeeping operations conducted under the command of regional organizations or individual Member States — in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. We look forward to further supporting the United Nations peacekeeping activities, including by providing training facilities in Azerbaijan.
The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were of key importance in promoting development worldwide. In that regard, we are confident that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be an effective tool in global efforts to achieve peace, prosperity and growth.
Over the past years, Azerbaijan has achieved impressive results on many MDG targets, especially on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, ensuring universal primary education and promoting gender equality. Currently, Azerbaijan is adapting its national sustainable development strategy to take into account the SDG targets aimed at developing a more sustainable, inclusive and diversified economy. In recognition of Azerbaijan’s outstanding commitment, determination and continuous efforts towards the implementation of the MDGs, my country received the 2015 South-South Award.
Despite the global economic and financial crises encountered by many countries of the region, in the first half of 2015 Azerbaijan registered economic growth of 5.7 per cent, while the growth in the non-oil sector was 9.2 per cent. My country has managed to become one of the crucial players of the global market in energy infrastructure projects, such as the Baku- Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, through the construction of trans-Anatolian and trans-Adriatic natural gas pipelines and the Southern Gas corridor, which will connect the energy pipeline networks of Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Greece, Albania and Italy.
Azerbaijan has also initiated strategic transport infrastructure networks, such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad project, which will connect the railway systems of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, and the new Baku international sea trade port, allowing short and efficient connection between East and West, reviving the ancient Silk Road.
Azerbaijan considers information and communication technologies as a driving force of development and
has initiated the Trans-Eurasian Information Super- Highway within the United Nations, which is designed to provide affordable and reliable broadband connectivity to landlocked countries of Eurasia, including Afghanistan and Central Asian States.
On the human dimension, Azerbaijan continues to promote tolerance, multiculturalism and understanding among peoples. We are proud that the first European Games in the history of the European continent were held this year in Baku, with the participation of more than 6,000 athletes from 50 countries. In 2017, my country will host the Islamic Solidarity Games. We are also planning to hold the seventh Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations in Baku in 2016.
Yesterday the President of Armenia delivered a statement at the general debate (see A/70/PV.17) that was full of the usual set of falsifications, distortions and misinterpretations, and in which he attempted once again to lecture others about principles and values, which in reality his Government disregards and opposes. The international community still recalls brutal massacres by invading Armenian troops on Azerbaijani civilians, including children, women and the elderly, as well as the establishment of the military dictatorship in Armenia after murdering the entire political elite of the country and killing a number of peaceful demonstrators protesting rigged presidential elections.
It is well known that Armenia unleashed the war and used force against my country and occupied almost one fifth of the territory of Azerbaijan, including the Nagorno-Karabakh region and seven adjacent districts, carried out ethnic cleansing of the seized areas by expelling about 1 million Azerbaijanis from their homes and committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during the conflict. The international community has consistently deplored in the strongest terms the use of force by Armenia against Azerbaijan and the resulting occupation of its territories.
In 1993 the Security Council adopted resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993), condemning the occupation of the territory of Azerbaijan and reaffirming respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and the inviolability of its internationally recognized borders. In those resolutions the Security Council also confirmed that the Nagorno-Karabakh region is part of
18/28 15-29701

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21
Azerbaijan and demanded an immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from all the occupied territories of my country.
Other international organizations have adopted a similar position and resolutions. In its landmark judgement in the case Chiragov and Others v. Armenia, the European Court of Human Rights held Armenia fully responsible for the occupation of the territories of Azerbaijan and in violation of the rights of Azerbaijani internally displaced persons. In total disregard for that judgement and the norms and principles of international law, Armenia continues its efforts aimed at further consolidating the status quo of the occupation by altering the physical, demographic and cultural characteristics of the occupied territories and denying the right of hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijani forcibly displaced persons to return to their homes and access to their properties.
On 26 September this year, the President of Armenia made an even more remarkable statement, referring to the occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan as a part of Armenia. We categorically reject that fallacious and bellicose statement, which testifies to Armenia’s apparent disregard of its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and international law, and represents yet another admission at the highest level of the aggression perpetrated by the Republic of Armenia against the Republic of Azerbaijan and demonstrates how the leadership of Armenia is far from engaging in a constructive search for peace. In that statement, the Armenian President even boasted that his country was one of the most militarized areas of the world.
Against that background, Armenia’s speculations on confidence-building measures are curious, to say the least. In fact, the real reasons for the lack of confidence are Armenia’s overt territorial claims to neighbouring countries, aggression against Azerbaijan, occupation and ethnic cleansing of its territories, denial of its responsibility for atrocious crimes committed in the course of the conflict, opposition to direct contacts between the Azerbaijani and Armenian communities of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, and the reluctance even to cooperate seriously on the issue of missing persons.
In reality, for effective confidence-building, it is crucial first and foremost to implement without further delay the plan of withdrawal of the armed forces of
Armenia from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. As for the ideas of elaborating a mechanism for investigating incidents along the line of contact, we should note that the major cause of those incidents is the continuing unlawful presence of the Armenian troops in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. Such an investigation mechanism must be an integral component of the above-mentioned withdrawal. Otherwise, it will serve only for consolidating the status quo, which even the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Minsk Group co-Chair countries have repeatedly stated to be unacceptable and unsustainable.
The Nagorno-Karabakh region has always been, and will remain, an inalienable part of Azerbaijan. We will never acquiesce to the seizure of our territories. The conflict can be resolved only on the basis of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan within its internationally recognized borders.
The military occupation of the territory of my country does not represent a solution, and will never produce a political outcome desired by Armenia. The sooner Armenia reconciles with this reality, the earlier the conflict will be resolved and the countries and peoples in the region, including Armenia, of course, will benefit from the prospects of cooperation and economic development.
Azerbaijan is the most interested party in the earliest negotiated settlement of the conflict. However, if the negotiations fail to bring, as an outcome, the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian troops, Azerbaijan will be compelled to use its inherent right of self-defence, guaranteed under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, to ensure the restoration of its sovereignty and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders.
Azerbaijan highly appreciates the principled stance of the States Members of the United Nations that has been repeatedly expressed on issues that are of the utmost importance for my country and pertaining to its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We count on the continued resolve of the international community in defending the purposes and principles of the Charter, as well as its strong solidarity with the just position of Azerbaijan.
"
70,2015,BIH,"Six days ago, world leaders, who gathered in this very Hall, brought to life a new vision of a just and sustainable world, free from poverty, fear and oppression. We agreed that our achievements, as well as our mistakes and failures, of the past decades formed a sufficiently solid foundation to transform the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) into a reality, rather than a utopia.
The determination and unity that we have demonstrated in creating and adopting the new Agenda have a special symbolism this year as we mark the seventieth anniversary of the Organization that continues to bring us all together, big and small
countries alike, and has never ceased to be a beacon of hope in times of despair.
The anniversary that we are celebrating also offers us an opportunity to analyse and evaluate the degree of progress that we have made individually and collaboratively in achieving the objectives set out in the Charter of the United Nations. We do that in the context of today’s highly dynamic global environment, which continues to bring in new challenges.
Those challenges are many, and it is increasingly difficult to predict the consequences of our failure to address them effectively. The crisis in Syria was, until only recently, merely a crisis in one country in one region of the Middle East. Not long ago, the refugee and the migrant crisis of the Syrian people materialized on our country’s own borders and reminded us that events in other places and regions and events at our own borders are closely intertwined and inseparable in today’s global environment.
The number of refugees and displaced persons fleeing destruction and death, leaving their homes and seeking a safe haven, is increasing literally each hour. For the majority of countries, the waves of refugees that arrive confront them with a heavier burden than they are able to manage. In addition, the tragedies involving innocent victims — especially and unforgivably children — place a great sense of responsibility not only on individual States, but also on the entire international community. They also test the limits of human solidarity and empathy. At the same time, it is
a warning to us that we must find urgent and effective solutions.
We are therefore very concerned at the deterioration in the devastating conflict in Syria, which continues to destabilize the region and presents an extremely serious threat to international peace and security. Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly condemns the unspeakable suffering and torture that the Syrian people are being subjected to. In that regard, we support the efforts of the Secretary-General, the United Nations and the broader international community to find a political and peaceful solution to the crisis in Syria. We believe that it is essential that the political transition in Syria be conducted in accordance with the Geneva communiqué of 2012 (S/2012/522, annex).
We are also carefully monitoring the situation in Yemen. We are very concerned about the political destabilization of that country and the deterioration in the security and humanitarian situation there, which have, to date, taken on intolerable proportions in that country. We call on all sides to come to a peaceful settlement of all the outstanding issues in order to establish a lasting peace and to allow, without delay, the distribution of humanitarian aid to the civilian population. In that context, the safety of the humanitarian-aid staff and the United Nations staff must be ensured.
As for the situation in Ukraine, we hope that the parties to that conflict will adhere to the peace agreement reached in Minsk as the basis for a lasting solution.
Terrorism and violent extremism are, without any doubt, the most serious of all the challenges we face today. The ideology of such groups, which is characterized by an absolute disregard for human life, is seriously undermining the fundamental values and achievements of civilization.
Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the full implementation of the United Nations Global Counter- Terrorism Strategy and the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, the activities of which have already shown results in strengthening intergovernmental cooperation and improving the capacity of individual Member States in that area. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a member of the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, established in 2014 and led by the United States, and it is one of the countries providing material assistance to the Government of Iraq as part of that effort.
As the Chair of the Council of Europe, our country leads the Council’s actions in the fight against terrorism, particularly through strengthening the legal framework, pursuant to the provisions of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014). The adoption of the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, adopted by the Committee of Ministers in May 2015, is a significant step in the fight against terrorism. I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize the importance of article 7 of the Additional Protocol, which provides for the parties to exchange information among the designated points of contact available on a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week basis.
A limited military response, when used as the only instrument in the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, has accomplished only short-lived results. Along with decisive, thorough, dedicated and well-coordinated military action, there must be a comprehensive strategy and holistic approach to combating violent extremism and terrorism, which should be aimed at addressing the root causes of the phenomenon. Among other measures, reducing poverty and inequality, improving education and providing opportunities to young generations are extremely important, even crucial. Furthermore, eliminating the effects of prejudice and xenophobia in our societies and communities also remains essential, if we wish to counter the spread of the ideology of violent extremism.
Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomes the extremely important agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme, reached in Vienna in July 2015. We believe that that historic agreement is evidence of the true superiority of diplomatic efforts and the parties’ determination to find a peaceful solution. The agreement can serve as a guideline for the resolution of other crisis situations.
Undoubtedly, the United Nations offers a guarantee of collective responsibility and security, notably through the greater use of preventive diplomacy and mediation, solid and carefully planned mandates for peacekeeping operations, and instruments for building lasting peace. Bosnia and Herzegovina has endeavoured to share its vast experience in peacebuilding and democratic transition, particularly through our membership since January 2014 in the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission. We support all activities and peace initiatives aimed at conflict prevention, and we actively contribute to collective security on a global scale. By participating in the United Nations peacekeeping missions in South Sudan, Cyprus,
2/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
Somalia, Afghanistan, the Congo and Mali, we contribute in the most direct way to maintaining and building world peace.
Following the suggestions of the United Nations, Bosnia and Herzegovina has had a significant participation of female police officers among our peacekeeping mission personnel; they now account for more than 20 per cent of the total number of our mission personnel. While our contribution to peacekeeping operations, in terms of numbers, is not as large as some participating countries with far larger military and police forces, we are very proud of the bravery of our Bosnia and Herzegovina police officers in peacekeeping missions around the world.
The degree of equality of women and girls compared to men with regard to certain rights has remained at a high level for decades in my country. We have always considered women to be the pillars of the family and communities and the bearers of our society’s development. Today, in the light of the events that my country has endured, we are convinced that women can be a major factor in reconciliation as well. We will therefore invest still greater efforts into advancing women’s interests, primarily as the best way to heal our society, mend what was broken, strengthen the family and enable women’s further development on the basis of full equality. As a member of the Executive Board of UN-Women, Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to invest efforts in promoting human rights at the international level, particularly through the strengthening of the status of women in accordance with the Beijing Platform for Action and the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Exactly 20 years ago, Bosnia and Herzegovina achieved a long-desired peace. Today, we are intensively working on implementing a reform agenda aimed at improving socioeconomic conditions and the rule of law in our country. At the same time, we are implementing the obligations that we have accepted under the Stabilization and Association Agreement of the European Union, the first of its kind for my country with the European Union, which came into force four months ago. The next step for my country is to submit its membership application and achieve the status of a candidate country.
At the same time, we are working to build a society that is fair and equitable and that offers parity. I can assure the Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s strong belief that our past experiences and the lessons
learned can contribute to solving numerous challenges at both the regional and the international levels. Our candidacy for membership in the Economic and Social Council for the period 2017-2019 should be viewed in that light. We are taking part in the general efforts to achieve a better and more unified world through those and similar activities.
Our commitment to full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the strengthening of democracy and multicultural dialogue and our respect for ethnic, cultural and religious diversity are unquestionable. In that regard, Bosnia and Herzegovina will spare no efforts to combat all forms of discrimination and intolerance against members of any part of society, as enshrined in our Constitution. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a complex, multi-ethnic State. In the light of the benefits and advantages that our diversity creates, acknowledged even in harsh times, we know precisely how important it is to protect all individual and collective rights and to bring them into mutual harmony in line with the relevant international human rights standards. We attach great importance to regional cooperation, and we are fully committed to building good relations with our neighbours on the basis of the principles of friendship and openness. We are aware that that is the only path to stability in the region of South-East Europe, which has often been turbulent in the past. Solely on that foundation can all countries in the region attain a full European perspective.
Although not at the top of today’s list of priorities for Bosnia and Herzegovina, climate change is among the most important globally. Climate change determines not only our future but also that of our children and their descendants. We have felt the consequences of global climate change in Bosnia and Herzegovina, notably in the past year during the devastating floods, when many of our citizens were forced to leave their homes. Unlike many other parts of our planet, Bosnia and Herzegovina is rich in large quantities of clean, potable water, which is becoming increasingly invaluable and rare in the world we live in. However, that fact is something that we can no longer take for granted, especially when we realize how helpless and weak we are before the forces of nature and the countless abuses that we have subjected our environment to. Therefore, along with the other Member States, we place our hopes on the upcoming twenty-first session o fthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December. We also call upon the parties to the Convention to redouble their
15-29658 3/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
efforts in order to reach a legally binding universal climate change agreement.
Finally, we realize that the United Nations will need to undergo change in order to continue to be able to respond to our increasingly complex requests and expectations. The seventieth anniversary is an occasion for celebration, as well as for critical consideration and reaffirmation of the values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Bosnia and Herzegovina remains fully committed to the paramount ideals of freedom, dignity and economic development for all nations and for the world, ideals that should be enjoyed by every living being on the planet.
"
70,2015,ESP,"There is a famous etching by Goya called “The Dream of Reason Produces Monsters”. Goya taught us that when reason deserts us, when it literally falls asleep, it leaves space free for the worst demons of our nature to take hold. Seventy years ago humankind awoke not from a dream, but from a nightmare. The unbridled exercise of power without the check of law or the calmness of reason produced the monsters of the Second World War and of the Shoah.
Law is the reason of States. I am referring to the law expressed through the formal foundations of a democratic, lawful State by the legitimate representatives of national sovereignty. When those foundations are overwhelmed, when the reason of law is flouted, the monsters of Goya are always lying in wait. Seventy years ago, humankind, represented by the United Nations at San Francisco, learned its lesson. The founders of the United Nations reached the conclusion that, just as States have constitutions that govern the norms of coexistence among their citizens, it was necessary for the international community to acquire its own supreme law, its own Magna Carta.
The San Francisco Charter is the constitution of humankind. Its Preamble and its purposes and principles underpin the edifice that is home to us all. Among them, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States is essential to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security. If those pillars are weakened, neglected or substituted by a will that considers itself above the law, that edifice literally will crumble on top of us and leave us out in the cold.
“A strong United Nations, a better world” is the motto with which we are commemorating the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. There are those who will deny that. For them the United Nations is a weak Organization, one unable to respond to the challenges and threats of our time. I do not think that is true. It is clear that there are reasons for hope.
The nuclear agreement reached with Iran and the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba and the prospect of a peace agreement in Colombia soon show that situations that have festered for far too long can be resolved. Spain welcomes that. Now we need to take a further step forward so that both Iran and Cuba, proud countries with very defined identities and highly qualified populations, can become
catalysts for change and contribute to stability and progress in their respective regions.
If it is possible to reach agreement in situations that many considered were unresolvable, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of Spain, it would be remiss of me not to mention the dispute over Gibraltar, the last colony on European territory. We want to re-initiate with the United Kingdom bilateral dialogue on the decolonization of Gibraltar based on the parameters established by the United Nations and the Brussels Declaration of 1984.
On a different tack, my country hopes that the United Kingdom will respond to the Spanish proposal of establishing a new local cooperation mechanism in the interests of social well-being and the economic development of the region. That would include participation by the local competent Gibraltarian authorities and the competent local and regional Spanish authorities.
Light predominates over the darkness in other areas too. I am thinking of the challenge of climate change. It is true that time is running out, but also that there are well-founded hopes that at the Paris summit in December we will achieve results that will allow us to stop the process of the deterioration of our common home and decisively turn things around. We therefore need a sustainable growth model, one that is equitable and leaves no one behind.
Once again, hopes have begun to turn into reality thanks to the recent adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). His Majesty the King, who was present at the Summit where the Agenda was adopted, reiterated the commitment of our country to its implementation — a commitment already translated into acts with the establishment of a Sustainable Development Goals fund, which is initially being financed by Spain but is open to all other States and to the private sector.
I consider myself to be among those who believe that the twenty-first century will be the century of the woman, but that will only be so if we all play our part. For as the President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet Jeria, has said, equality will not happen by itself. That is why Spain has for some time been encouraging the participation and leadership of women in all dimensions of collective life. To that end, our strategic plan for equal opportunities 2014-2016 has been allocated €3.1 billion.
20/28 15-29701

We will be bringing our national commitment to equality to our presidency of the Security Council. During our presidency, on 13 October, we will hold a high-level open debate on Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, to be presided over by the President of the Government of Spain. I invite everyone to take part at the highest level, because the occasion merits it.
Terrorism is the main threat to the model of the just, prosperous, equitable and open society that we seek to build for the peace and security of the international community. Spain has been hit hard by both domestic and international terrorism. Back in 1960, 55 years ago, as a result of the explosion of a bomb placed in a railway station by the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna terrorist group, a 22-month-old child, Begoña Urroz, died. Since then 850 human beings — men, women and children — have lost their lives as a result of the terrorist madness. All terrorism is born from hatred and disdain for life and is a crime against humanity. That is the basis that we work on.
But it is also true that evil manifests itself in different forms depending on the circumstances and the historical times. In our lifetime jihadist terrorism is at its most lethal insidious form. Spain too suffered at its hands. On 11 March 2004, 190 people of various nationalities, the majority workers, were killed, and more than a 1,800 people were injured.
In the case of Daesh we are up against a terrorist movement that has sought to control a territorial base from which it seeks to launch attacks and to destroy our model of civilization. Because all of us are targets, we must all form a common front against Daesh. There can be no negotiation with terrorists; they must be defeated — only lawfully, but with all of the law. That is why Spain did not hesitate to join, right from the beginning, the international coalition fighting against Daesh in Iraq at the side of the Government and the people of Iraq.
But military intervention is not enough. It is also necessary to combat radicalization, which leads so many youngsters to fill their ranks. Spain placed at the disposal of this common struggle its own experience in multilateral initiatives such as the Alliance of Civilizations, the Vienna King Abdullah International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue and the Union for the Mediterranean.
From its own experience we know that saving and keeping alive the memory of the victims is vital to prevent a repetition of such horrors. On too many occasions we have seen the victims presented as being the guilty, as though bringing their sacrifice upon themselves. If I may, another personal experience I should like to recall is that until 1997, the year that saw the assassination of Miguel Ángel Blanco, we had to bury our dead virtually in secret. In order for that not to be repeated, and so that the voice of the victims can reach all corners of the planet, on 21 October we will open up the Security Council for the sake of dignity, memory and justice.
To the same end, joining forces to combat radicalization and extremism, the Madrid Club has invited about 100 former Heads of State or Government on 27 and 28 October. Their experience will be incredibly useful to us.
Now let me refer to impunity. Spain and Romania have decided to propose the establishment of an international criminal court against terrorism. We think it is necessary for the United Nations to consider this proposal in all its scope. This would be an international jurisdictional mechanism to combat the crimes of international terrorism using the tools of international law. Such a court would complement the action of the International Criminal Court and would intervene when a State is not in a position to carry out trials itself.
Conflicts in regions such as the Middle East and in parts of Africa are the origin of the most serious migratory crisis Europe has seen since the Second World War. The images of this immense tragedy rightly move our hearts, but it is our reason that can provide solutions. Of course, what is most urgent is the humanitarian response — saving lives, providing shelter, healing and feeding. But it is important also to draw up a comprehensive asylum and integration policy that sets out the concepts of asylum and economic migration and that takes into account the rights and dignity of people who risk their lives to find a better future for themselves and their children. I think that the time has come to begin thinking about a global covenant under United Nations auspices in which countries of origin, countries of transit and host countries would all participate. Migration is a global challenge that we can solve only by working together.
I said earlier that the origin of the current migratory crisis were the festering conflicts, conflicts often
15-29701 21/28

A/70/PV.21 30/09/2015
exacerbated by lack of response from the international community and as a result of the brutality of the parties. The paradigmatic case is that of Syria — four and a half years of conflict; 250,000 lives lost; 12 million people in desperate need of humanitarian assistance; 7.6 million internally displaced persons; 4 million refugees in neighbouring countries — the statistics have been calling out to us for too long.
A solution to the conflict is urgent. We must work on two fronts: first, by providing an immediate humanitarian response to assuage the suffering of the Syrian people, and, secondly, supporting the inclusive political process proposed by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Staffan de Mistura.
There is similar urgency with regard to the conflict in Libya. We support the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, my compatriot Bernardino León, and we continue with impatience to seek an agreement for the formation of a Government of national accord. We call for courage and for all parties to come together to overcome the fracture of a country divided in two, and where on the horizon we can already see the black flag of Daesh just a few kilometres from our coast. Let me say that the partition of Libya would be the worst possible solution.
Of course, in the Middle East we continue to be committed to an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians that goes via the two-State solution with mutually agreed borders. We must revitalize the peace process. Spain will always be willing to support the parties to return to the path of direct negotiations.
In Africa the situation in Mali, the Central African Republic and elsewhere troubles us greatly. But it is not all darkness in that continent; there are bright spots. The response to the Ebola epidemic and the development and rebuilding plans presented by the countries affected by Ebola fill us with hope. Spain continues to be very optimistic when it comes to Africa’s future.
In Europe the main shadow, but with certain bright spots, continues to be the crisis in Ukraine, where it is vital to implement the Minsk agreements and to continue building a climate of trust so as to put an end to a conflict of a different time. We call on the parties to seek that path.
Finally, I am convinced that today the United Nations is stronger in a world that, while it is still far from perfect, is better than that world of 70 years ago.
To keep moving forward towards perfection it is crucial to respect the values and the purposes and principles of the Charter, including territorial integrity. Violation thereof, as history has taught us, is one of the preferred instruments of the monsters of Goya to put us to sleep. To avoid this it is necessary for the reason of law and that the law of reason should remain ever alert. Among the foundations are always dialogue, reconciliation and cohabitation. Without them we will be left out in the cold.

70,2015,JPN,"The United Nations, which this year commemorates the seventieth anniversary of its founding, brings together people who do not easily despair even in the face of desperate circumstances. What else can explain the Organization’s ability to withstand such adversity and to arrive at this moment? The Ebola virus has spread wildly. Extremism is running rampant. And now an immense tide of refugees is attempting to flee from horror, with their very lives at risk. We must address whatever challenges arise, under the auspices of the United Nations. Each Member State must bring its own distinctive capabilities to the struggle.
Japan has a history of supporting nation-building in a wide range of places. We have worked extensively to enhance human resources, and we have given our utmost in humanitarian assistance and in the promotion of women’s rights. Now more than ever, Japan wishes to offer its wealth of experience unstintingly. Japan will further enhance its assistance for refugees and internally displaced persons from Syria and Iraq. In monetary terms, our assistance for 2015 comes to approximately
15-29431 41/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
$810 million, triple the amount we provided last year. In Lebanon, we will spend $2 million in new assistance measures. We will leverage that amount in order to give momentum to the collaboration between humanitarian and development actors. We will also provide approximately $2.5 million in humanitarian assistance to neighbour countries of the European Union that are grappling with the influx of refugees and migrants, such as the Republic of Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Each of those assistance measures is an emergency countermeasure that Japan is able to implement. At the same time, however, our steadfast principle is always to endeavour to return to the root causes of a problem and to improve the situation on the ground. In order to bring stability to the daily lives of the Iraqi people, it is vital to ensure that they have dependable water supply and sewage systems. Taking those programmes into account, Japan is preparing assistance worth approximately $750 million to help build peace and fully consolidate peace across the Middle East and Africa.
It is important to look squarely at the facts. Behind the present tide of refugees is a far greater number of people who are unable even to flee and become refugees. Rebuilding devastated countries and transforming them into places that allow people to resume the pursuit of happiness may seem like a roundabout way of reaching our goal, but promoting and cultivating each human being’s abilities and capacity to fight fear and want at the grass-roots level is in fact the shortest path to that end. That strong belief has guided Japan’s policy of prioritizing the promotion of education and health and, in particular, the importance of strengthening women of all ages. Our policy seeks to fully ensure human security. I am extremely pleased that such efforts to value each individual were thoroughly incorporated within the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (resolution 70/1) set forth by the United Nations community.
Japan wishes to create an environment in which mothers of newborns are free to focus exclusively on the healthy growth of their children. In reflecting on that premise, I came across a photograph that portrayed the contents of a bag carried by a female refugee. I asked myself what people would pack in the one bag they take with them when fleeing hardship? Abessa, a 20-year-old woman who crossed the Mediterranean Sea on a rubber raft, was able to bring very little with
her when she fled a Palestinian refugee camp south of Damascus. Everything in the photograph was for her 10-month old daughter: a clean change of socks, a hat and a single jar of baby food.
But as I contemplated that photograph, my eyes were drawn to a notebook that had been wrapped carefully in plastic to protect it from getting wet. I recognized it as a handbook on maternal and child health that Japan has been distributing in refugee camps in Syria. In Japan, all pregnant women receive this handbook, in which they can keep records about their own health and that of their child. This handbook system has been in place for more than 70 years.
Who among all the mothers who smile sweetly at the hand-written records of their child’s heights and weights could wish for that same child to grow up to become an apostle of fear? Each woman’s handbook is a record of her prayers for her child to grow up healthy. Her notebook acquires a power of its own: the power of the mother’s wish for her child’s life not to be squandered. We have distributed maternal and child health handbooks in refugee camps in Palestine, Syria, and Jordan in the hope that a mother’s love can transform the soil that sometimes gives rise to despair and fear. We know that some women continue to treasure those hope-infused handbooks even during their exodus. I am struck by the fact that the concept of human security, which seeks to empower each individual, has produced such eloquent, albeit bitter results.
The rule of law and the principle of equality before the law are values that Japan respects above all others. The extension of those principles also begins with fostering human capacity. I would like to share with the Assembly the story of a young Japanese woman who has been giving her all through Japan’s training assistance programme for police officers. In order to break with the very root of violence and fear, it is critical to cultivate good police personnel and good police governance. In that conviction, we have been directing our efforts at training police personnel in Afghanistan and many other locations. Through the Japan International Cooperation Agency, Japan has been steadily providing such assistance to the national police force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 2004. More than 20,000 police personnel to date, including women and a number of former armed insurgent soldiers, have received such training. Our motto has been to cultivate a police force that is friendly towards the local people.
42/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
The Japan International Cooperation Agency was responsible for developing and implementing the training plan, and women have consistently been in charge of Japan’s staff on the ground in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. One such woman was called a “little giant” when she first arrived. Seen alongside her male police colleagues, she was indeed small in stature. yet she was dubbed a giant because she never flinched from difficulties and took the initiative to grapple with issues, making full use of the French language skills she had acquired. The national police personnel respected and trusted her. Two years ago, here in the General Assembly (see A/68/PV.12), I emphasized that Japan has recently made a point of establishing itself as a proactive contributor to peace, based on the principle of international cooperation. The woman I just mentioned is one of the Japanese individuals dedicated to this and working on the front lines.
I am one of Japan’s biggest champions of ensuring that women take on many of the roles that will shape our country’s future. In our external assistance efforts, too, we emphasize policies and measures aimed at improving women’s safety, health and well-being and upholding their human rights. In countries recovering from civil war, Japanese women have been making splendid contributions in support of those working to uphold the rule of law, something I am particularly proud of. On a number of previous occasions, I have urged the international community to ensure that the twenty-first century will be an era in which women’s human rights are protected.
Today, I am also pleased to be able to report that Japan has finalized its action plan on women’s participation and protection based on Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), important aspects of which include protecting women and girls from violence and providing them with basic health services. Moreover, this year, for the second consecutive year, we hosted WAW! 2015, the World Assembly for Women, holding meaningful discussions with a view to creating a society in which women can shine.
I believe the United Nations is a venue where optimistic realists can come together. It does not give itself up to impotent despair of the future, but neither does it avert its eyes from reality. That is how it has shaped the 70 years of its history. And I, too, feel compelled to face up squarely to reality on several issues, the first of which is North Korea. In that regard, Japan intends to work in coordination with other relevant countries
in an effort to arrive at a comprehensive resolution of the outstanding issues, including those related to abductions, nuclear power and missiles.
This year, the seventieth anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, was one in which we relived our grief. Regrettably, however, it seems that in some places nuclear arsenals, with no transparency, continue to grow. Moreover, this year’s Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons failed to come up with guidelines for future nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We believe that the United States and Russia should continue to reduce their nuclear weapon stockpiles, while we also insist that other States possessing nuclear weapons should also work to reduce their arsenals. In its determination to eliminate nuclear weapons completely, Japan is preparing a new draft resolution aimed at promoting united action on the issue by the international community that I am sure many countries will support.
This year, as we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, a major push for reform of the Security Council has begun. During the last session of the General Assembly, the assiduous efforts of dedicated individuals and various countries greatly intensified the discussion of Security Council reform. And two weeks ago, here in this very Hall, that enthusiasm was passed on to the current session as the entire Assembly applauded (see A/70/PV.1) . Emboldened by that enthusiasm and by my conviction regarding the role that Japan should play in that process, I will continue to work to achieve reform of the Security Council with the cooperation of the President and Member States. Japan hopes to become a permanent member of the Council and to make a commensurate contribution.
Here I would like to emphasize three points. First and foremost, Japan has remained a strictly peace-loving nation during the 70 years since the end of the Second World War, and we have accumulated a successful record in our efforts to foster peace and prosperity around the world. Japan worked hard diplomatically in Cambodia and Timor-Leste, first by sending personnel to participate in peacekeeping operations there and later by providing assistance over the long term.
The first of the three stages involved in peacekeeping operations is decision-making, in which we determine what is to be done and where. That is
15-29431 43/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
followed by the necessary preparations of personnel and financing and, lastly, by the process of launching physical operations on the ground. Japan has been able to help to bridge the information gaps that tend to occur between those stages. We have also been able to make a positive and major contribution by ensuring that we take full responsibility for our decisions and actions at every stage. Right now, members of an engineering unit of Japan’s self-defence forces are working around the clock in South Sudan. In Kenya, experts from our ground self-defence force are training members of the Kenyan, Ugandan, Tanzanian and Rwandan armed forces on the best ways to operate heavy engineering equipment so as to deal with the problems that arise when peacekeeping operations become hopelessly trapped in areas where roads and bridges have been destroyed. We also recently made changes to our domestic legal framework that will enable us to contribute more broadly to peacekeeping operations going forward.
Secondly, Japan is a country that values ownership and partnership. We have been of the view for many years that if we are to overcome despair and improve our welfare, it is important to give equal consideration both to the wishes and intentions of the parties concerned and to international cooperation. Our ultimate objective is to ensure that the people themselves gain the ownership that will enable them to determine the direction of their own lives, and by emphasizing that approach to arrive at the concept of valuing human security.
My third point is that Japan always strives to listen actively to the voices of the parties concerned. Three days ago, for the third consecutive year, I hosted the Japan-African Regional Economic Communities Summit Roundtable, meeting with leaders from the African countries concerned. For the past 20 years, Japan has also hosted the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD), and next year for the first time TICAD will convene in Africa, where I hope to be able to listen to an even richer spectrum of African voices. Last night I also met with leaders from the Pacific island countries to discuss such matters as observing 5 November in common as World Tsunami Day, as well as conducting training and capacity- building related to tsunamis.
Japan became a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the first time in 1958, two years after it was admitted to membership in the United Nations. If we are again selected this year thanks to
the gracious support of all those here, it will be our eleventh time serving on the Council.
More than any other country, Japan has subjected itself to review by its peers. The three points I have noted today represent some of Japan’s strengths, something that all here will concur with, based on the path we have trodden so far. We intend to use those strengths to help strengthen the United Nations. We are a people who have always seen in the two letters “UN” a certain radiance. Bearing the standard of its role as a proactive contributor to peace based on the principle of international cooperation, Japan is determined to undertake reform of the Security Council in order to transform the United Nations into a body relevant to the twenty-first century and subsequently, as a permanent member of the Security Council, to fulfil its responsibilities by making still greater contributions to world peace and prosperity.
In conclusion, I look forward to Members’ kind understanding.
"
70,2015,MAR,"King Mohammed VI has mandated me
to convey his congratulations, his esteem and his greetings. He also asked me to deliver this royal speech to the General Assembly at its seventieth session.
The current session of the General Assembly is particularly important because it has seen the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). It is an opportunity to reiterate our collective commitment to achieving one of the lofty objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and to fulfil the aspirations of peoples throughout the world. This session also coincides with the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations establishment at a time when the international community is facing serious, unprecedented challenges and challenges that require joint, efficient and integrated action. The Kingdom of Morocco’s position regarding these challenges and the spectrum of regional and international issues will be laid out during the General Assembly’s committee meetings and at the ministerial discussions that will take place on the sidelines of the General Assembly.
The preparation of the development Agenda for the next 15 years must be based on an objective assessment of what we have done since 2000. Have we managed to improve the day-to-day life of the poor? Are the results achieved solid and sustainable enough to withstand tensions, wars and social and economic crises? The review of the Millennium Development Goals shows that tangible progress has been made between 1990 and 2015, yet the remaining gaps among regions throughout the world and within certain countries remain a legitimate cause of concern. This situation tarnishes the image of international cooperation and casts doubt on our collective action within the United Nations.
But that does not necessarily mean that we have failed. This situation should rather lead all stakeholders to consider the best means to promote development and to correct the malfunctions that affect international cooperation. In this context, the Kingdom of Morocco hopes that the Sustainable Development Goals will contribute to developing an ambitious Agenda that can improve the situation at all levels — national, regional and international.
However relevant and promising the Sustainable Development Agenda is, its credibility will depend on our ability to find the financing necessary for its implementation. International cooperation therefore has to keep pace with the new international reality.
10/28 15-29701

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21
It needs to shake off the legacy and geopolitical calculations of the past and refrain from imposing near impossible conditions for accessing support. The Ebola crisis showed that besides expressions of solidarity dictated by circumstance, the international support to the countries affected was far from sufficient and did not rise to the level of commitment required by the gravity of the situation.
Development does not come through bureaucratic decisions or by means of technical reports that lack credibility. Development requires the deep understanding of the realities of peoples’ existence and their characteristic capacities, as well as an objective analysis of the context in which they live. It also requires serious work to respond to their aspirations and genuine concerns.
I am very familiar with the difficult situation in Africa and I think I know what I am talking about. Many Africans are indeed living in very difficult conditions. The reality is infinitely more cruel and bitter than is indicated in the reports of some international governmental and non-governmental organizations. The life of these Africans is a struggle and subject to daily challenges and scant resources, but at the same time they live with dignity and have a sincere patriotic commitment to a better future.
To address this situation, we must develop an inclusive and consistent mid-term approach with complementary measures. Urgent, practical initiatives are also required because deteriorating conditions and daily pressing needs cannot wait for international bureaucracy to wake up and take the necessary decisions. From that perspective, Africa must be at the heart of international development cooperation in order to help the continent free itself from its colonial past and unlock its potential. Morocco therefore calls on the United Nations and regional and international financial institutions to draft an action plan for the economic transformation of Africa and the provision of steady resources for its financing.
Despite its promise, Africa stands at a crossroads because without substantial and tangible international support, the continent will major inequalities will emerge among its countries. Some countries will progress and develop while others continue to have problems and sink into poverty, ignorance and instability. We call for peace and stability to be made top priorities in order to prevent conflicts, tackle extremism and terrorism, and
resolve the migration problem through an approach that takes into account the dignity of migrants, preserves their basic rights, and addresses the root causes of this phenomenon.
This year in my country, we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of our national human development initiative, which has contributed to reducing poverty, marginalization, exclusion and interregional disparities. It also enabled Morocco to achieve Millennium Development Goal 1 in 2013. International organizations have therefore ranked Morocco third among the five countries in the world to have adopted the best public welfare programmes and initiatives. We are ready to put our experience in this field at the service of our partners, in particular in Africa.
Because of its geographical location and its strategic choices, the Kingdom of Morocco is actively involved in addressing all global issues and concerns, including migration, human rights, climate change, sustainable development and the fight against terrorism. Morocco national response to each has made a sound contribution to international efforts to face these unprecedented global challenges.
Morocco’s commitment to addressing these universal issues is reflected particularly in the fight against climate change, one of the most serious threats facing humankind as a whole. We participated in the Rio Summit in 1992 and have since worked to develop a national environmental policy based on involving all relevant stakeholders and on the effective use of financial resources dedicated to climate issues. This policy is reflected in our adoption of a national charter for environment and sustainable development and in the Green Morocco Plan as well as in our ambitious programmes for solar and wind renewable energy, which aim to meet 42 per cent of Morocco’s energy needs by 2020.
We are also faithfully meeting our commitments in the field of the environment, and in 2015 officially presented our intended nationally determined contribution. This includes strong and ambitious commitments to its participation in setting up an international environmental order that is fair and solidarity based. In this respect Morocco is proposing to host in Marrakesh in 2016 the twenty-second Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
15-29701 11/28

A/70/PV.21 30/09/2015
We should like to take this opportunity to reiterate our support for France’s efforts to achieve a global, comprehensive, sustainable, balanced and legally binding agreement at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Therefore we see the Paris and Marrakesh Conferences as two complementary steps towards making a qualitative improvement in the fight against climate change and avoiding previous failures caused by a lack of coordination and cooperation among stakeholders.
We therefore stress the importance of the call issued on 20 September in Tangier by Morocco, together with President François Hollande of France, for collective, solidarity-based international action on climate change. The choice of Morocco to launch this joint initiative was not incidental but a demonstration of the esteem in which our country is held in its position at the vanguard of the efforts of African nations to adopt efficient national strategies in the field of renewable energy. Consistent with this solidarity-based policy, Morocco will spare no effort to broadcast the voices and concerns of the African continent and the small island developing States, which are the most vulnerable to climate change.
The United Nations is today celebrating its seventieth anniversary and has reached the age of maturity, wisdom and responsibility. Those same principles and values should govern the action of the international community in resolving the regional disputes it faces. The Organization’s work must not be a destabilizing factor for countries that contribute to multilateral cooperation and action. Morocco therefore rejects any irresponsible or risky course of action with regard to the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara. Indeed, many international Powers fully realize that the unrealistic plans that have been drawn up inside offices and the erroneous proposals that have been made can only undermine the situation in the region.
We have high hopes that the United Nations will maintain its efforts to resolve disputes by peaceful means and remain committed to upholding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States in order to establish the peace, security and stability to which the peoples of the world aspire.
"
70,2015,MNG,"I extend my heartfelt congratulations to you, Mr. President. You can count on my delegation’s full support during the jubilee session and the year ahead.
We are commemorating the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. As a family of nations, our hopes for peace and progress, as expressed in the Charter of the United Nations, still resonates deeply today. The United Nations is designed to uphold humankind’s primary aspirations to live in peace, enjoy equal rights and achieve everlasting happiness. The United Nations has tirelessly served those noble purposes for seven decades. If the United Nations did not exist, most of humankind would have ended up in violent confrontations and faced more arduous, complex challenges than those that have arisen.
12/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
Together, we have achieved a lot and we have charted a better course. The number of sovereign nations has quadrupled since 1945. The world’s economic output has increased fivefold. Human beings enjoy longer, healthier lives. We are more literate and educated. Today, the world has achieved the highest degree of international cooperation in history. Starting with the founding of the United Nations, Governments have steadily invested more and more in new means of cooperation. Those tools create new options, more space for compromises and more legal frameworks than humankind has ever possessed. The United Nations has justly become the primary universal organization working for peace, instead of war; prosperity, instead of poverty; and a dignified life for all, instead of human rights violations. Hence, I would like to state that the past 70 years were the best 70 years ever for humankind.
The founding of the United Nations, a historic milestone, connects our past, present and future. All of humankind is poised to make another great stride towards a new, better reality. I am hopeful for the future because we have the United Nations, because we have useful experience to tackle today’s challenges, and because a new generation of humankind is rising. The new generation has creative solutions to challenges and sees new opportunities in them. It shares knowledge and advance technologies.
At this moment more than ever in history, we share a common destiny as a family of nations; yet, despite our achievements, billions of people still live in forbidding conditions. Our home, Mother Earth, is becoming more turbulent and is in fragile health. The Second World War is behind us and the arms race of the Cold War ended two decades ago. Many military conflicts today are not tied to defending a particular territory, but are motivated by borderless ideological, criminal and religious goals.
Paradoxically, although we are more aware of those challenges and understand them better than ever, we seem unable to tackle them decisively and effectively. That is why we have gathered here and embarked on a momentous new journey to do much better to transform our world. The only way to bring peace and stability is through a system of rules and norms, laws and institutions that every country agrees to abide by in exchange for the benefits of peace and stability. If the United Nations fails to adopt a system of laws, we all will fail. The future is not only about the United Nations. The future is about all of us. It is about our community; it is about our family. Therefore, we have no right to fail.
We have recently shown that we can make positive changes. At the dawn of the new century, we adopted and have since implemented the Millennium Development Goals. We achieved many targets, yet failed to achieve some others. Still, by and large, the global community passed the test. We learned lessons about working together and made huge strides towards achieving positive goals. With the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), the international community produced a new history-making document. The entire United Nations family agreed on that road map towards sustainable development. Now humankind has a truly universal, ambitious action plan for the upcoming 15 years. A consensus-based, global platform, the Agenda is for all, because every single human being holds a stake in our planet’s future. The 17 Goals and 169 targets are real. Yet, they also embody the dream of humankind. Never before in history have nations reached such a universal and unanimous agreement.
Our historic 2030 Agenda is comprehensive and sustainable. We have agreed on urgent targets on a broad range of economic and social challenges and on environmental emergencies. Is that not miraculous? With one voice, the entire world shouldered a mountain of responsibilities and adopted these bold Goals. In the Agenda, I recognize the overarching objectives for global sustainable development. I note that the Goals are intended literally to save Mother Earth for future generations, which I can readily accept to save a happy, equal human race. I believe that we must build inclusive, capable institutions and create prosperous, peaceful, open, just, equitable societies. In order to advance those societies, the family of nations needs a robust, inclusive and open mechanisms. We must have reliable implementing, monitoring and accountability regulations and institutions in place. I appeal to every Member State to adopt national laws and policies to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. Such laws and policies would ensure their sustainability.
I am deeply proud of my country’s contributions to the common causes of humankind. During the past quarter century, Mongolia has relentlessly striven to build an open and just society with a free
15-29431 13/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
market economy, participatory democracy and environmentally conscientious policies. We have made notable progress in the areas of governance transparency, citizens’ participation and the reduction of corruption and poverty. In the past quarter century, the life expectancy of Mongolians has increased by seven years. Our gross domestic product (GDP) has increased by a factor of more than 20. We believe in human rights and human creativity, and we foster private initiatives. Our private sector generates more than 80 per cent of our GDP growth. My country, within a single generation, peacefully transformed from one of the most isolated and closed regimes in the world to one of its most vibrant and open democracies. Mongolia also created one of the most unique, open, competitive and fair election systems in our region. It has nationwide electronic voting and biometric voter registration. We no longer use wooden or paper boxes or finger inks, and public participation goes beyond electronic voting.
Corruption is still a big threat. Yet, over the past five years, with transparent, determined and enforceable policies, our country’s corruption index has dropped by one-third, according to Transparency International. We will continue to block the menace of corruption head-on. Mongolia is among the top countries in the world in the number of media tools used per capita. We have the most open, censorship-free private media, including social media and burgeoning Internet use. We have slightly more than 3 million citizens, yet it feels like there are 3 million journalists, too. New media technologies, transparency and public scrutiny make our society much healthier.
We have adopted and implemented a set of laws related to an open, fair, service-oriented judiciary. Because the process takes place under strict civil monitoring, people’s confidence in a fair court of law is being restored. We have also created regulations and institutions regarding public hearings and participatory democracy. We are also prudently enforcing a law called the Glass Account — a budget transparency law that requires full disclosure of public expenditures.
Education is key to human development and the county’s development. More than one-third of our population is engaged in educational activities. More student-centred than previously, our education system emphasizes their practical involvement in learning. Our Government also now covers tuition if
a Mongolian citizen is accepted into one of the world’s top universities.
We believe in gender equality and women’s empowerment. Mongolia is a strong supporter of the United Nations in that cause. If societies are to advance, we need more women in public service at all levels, local and global. If women hold more positions of power, we will have less suffering and conflict and more harmony and civic engagement. All such efforts on the part of Mongolian citizens constitute a just, transparent, inclusive, accountable and action-oriented platform to guide us on a sustainable development path. I am confident that building on those bedrock successes and decisively moving forward is compatible with your appeal, Mr. President, for a new commitment to action.
Today, the world faces a shocking range of new challenges on a global scale — from weapons of mass destruction to global warming; from human rights violations to humanitarian disasters; from heinous crimes and mass terror to the breakdown of sovereign States; from an uncertain supply of energy, food and water to new challenges to freedom and security. In facing global challenges, we must admit one thing — no one country, big or small, can address them on its own. Therefore, the coordinated actions of all players and countries are needed.
When all cultures and civilizations unite, we can tackle global challenges. The upcoming twenty-first session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris later this year, will be the first new test. It will require the widest possible cooperation ofall countries. We all must bear responsibility for protecting planet Earth and its ecosystems for the benefit of present and future generations. We must all work to ensure justice and fairness throughout the world. Every nation and Government must actively contribute to the global good according to their respective capabilities and responsibilities.
Mongolia has committed to always doing its humble share to promote global well-being. We Mongols are eager to contribute. Our peacekeepers proudly serve, along with fellow United Nations peacekeepers, to maintain international order and security. Mongolia has become one of the 20 largest peacekeeping contributors in the world. To date, 14,000 Mongolian peacekeepers have served on active duty in global hot spots. That is
14/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
a significant number in proportion to the size of our population.
We are enthusiastic to share our experiences in transitioning to democracy in our quest for freedom, justice and development. When Mongolian citizens share and actively collaborate with countries in our region and beyond, we make our own success more durable. We care deeply about global stability. Mongols believe that we must preserve our planet by eliminating nuclear weapons throughout the world.
For 23 years, our country has maintained a nuclear- weapon-free status. Any nation seeking nuclear power must not endanger the peace and security of their independent neighbours. We believe that the solution to those challenges is engagement, rather than isolation. We believe that strengthening multilateral collaboration and mutual trust among countries is vital. In Asia, Mongolia is a non-aligned nation and an honest broker that promotes peace and security. We launched a regional initiative similar to that of the Helsinki dialogue, known as the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on North-East Asian Security. Within that security initiative, Mongolia has hosted and has helped arrange multilateral meetings, conferences, and symposiums to examine peace and security issues. We also put forward a common platform called the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development, or FORUM-Asia. A compelling need exists to establish a solid and inclusive platform for comprehensive dialogues involving all Asian States.
FORUM-Asia would seek to promote an equal representation of the interests of all sovereign nations in Asia, whether big or small. All nations would bear in mind the concerns of all other nations, rather than wrestle one-on-one within the global arena. It would ensure each member State its independence, integrity, and right to development. We invite all interested parties to play an active part of that cause.
Our country also successfully chaired the world’s most reputable democracy movement, the Community of Democracies, for two years. Currently, Mongolia is chairing the Freedom Online Coalition. The first Asian country to lead that important community, we promote universal Internet access. We support a comprehensive convention on Internet freedom, to be agreed to by all United Nations Member States. I appeal to everyone to work collectively to advance the great, global digital
revolution, in order to bring greater prosperity to humankind.
Mongolia has pursued a peaceful, open and multi-pillared foreign policy. That stance has enabled us to declare Mongolia to be a State of permanent neutrality. Our national laws and the international treaties to which Mongolia is signatory are consistent with the principles of neutrality. I therefore kindly ask for Members’ understanding and support for Mongolia’s peaceful, open, neutral and active foreign policy efforts. I am convinced that Mongolia’s status of permanent neutrality will contribute to the strengthening of peace, security and development in our region and the world, in general.
Recently, Mongolia hosted the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions, and for the first time in our country, the autumn meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Parliamentary Assembly was convened. The human rights experts and the European parliamentarians had fruitful, lively discussions and exchanges. The conference also provided a splendid opportunity for them to comprehend at first hand our achievements in protecting and advancing human rights, in exercising the rule of law and in running a pluralistic and open society.
We are honoured to be hosting many events in the coming months and year in our capital city. Most importantly, the eleventh Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) will be held in Mongolia in the summer of 2016. Leaders of 53 countries in Asia and Europe will meet in Mongolia on the historic twentieth jubilee of the founding of ASEM. I earnestly look forward to welcoming them. Mongolia will further consolidate and strengthen our peace initiatives and our role as mediator. Our doors are always open for dialogue and engagement. We will always say that all are very welcome to cooperate with us in the spirit of freedom, justice and prosperity. We are ready to share the lessons we have learned and to listen to and learn from the lessons of other nations.
I wish to stress that Mongolia is running for the first time for membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council. We believe that the Human Rights Council is a crucial body for the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide. It is a platform for open discussions on human rights issues, and it positively impacts national and international
15-29431 15/51

policies. Mongolia reaffirms its full commitment to the promotion of human rights and our willingness to share our experience in transitioning to democracy, fighting against corruption, abolishing the death penalty and ensuring genuine human rights. I respectfully ask every Member State to extend its valuable support to Mongolia’s candidacy for the Human Rights Council at the October elections.
We, the States Members of the United Nations, need to mobilize the full potential of humankind to achieve the primary purpose for establishing the United Nations, namely, the promotion of peace, the respect for human rights and inclusive economic and social development. I believe that, in the twenty-first century, the United Nations will remain at the heart of our common humanity. Its mission will be defined by a new, more profound awareness of the sanctity and dignity of every human life, regardless of race, gender or religion. Nevertheless, there are still numerous cases involving cruel violations of human dignity and rights. One thing is certain: every nation State should always strive for good governance, the strict rule of law and a sound human rights policy.
I reiterate the appeals of all speakers in the Assembly that we must vow to exercise clear and decisive leadership in effectively tackling the tough challenges ahead and in fulfilling the core missions of the United Nations. We have many opportunities to benefit the world. We are the first in history to have the potential, technology and resources to resolve the world’s problems.
When I observe a giant display of military might, I think of the huge amount of money, human ingenuity and time that are being spent on war machines and weapons of mass destruction. With a fraction of the money that we spend and the technology that we develop to put on such macho war shows, we could solve many of today’s troubling issues. We also have a smart, tech-savvy, energetic young generation, who will soon shoulder our tough challenges with their innovative, dynamic and shrewd solutions. They give us hope and reassure us.
I would like to reiterate that the solemn purpose of the United Nations has always been to enhance global peace, protect fellow human beings and contribute to global well-being. We all know there are well-founded criticisms of the United Nations. If our United Nations is to survive in the new reality, we must embrace substantive change. We need reforms to build a just and
common home. If we delay action, change will become more painful and even more challenging. The United Nations is still our most representative and important global body. Its foundation is based on the preservation of the rights and interests of all nations, whether big or small, so that they may have a voice, a vote, and be part of our common human home. More relevant than ever, the United Nations is our common home where nations can meet and create solutions to solve the challenges of the world. If the 70 years since the United Nations was founded were the best 70 years ever, as I believe, then let us make the next 70 years even better.
We humans are at our best when we face challenges and when we exercise collective bravery, spirit and leadership. With the Sustainable Development Goals, we all become developing countries and we all have a stake in our plans for success. There is no future without peace, there is no planet without sustainability, and there is no humanity without justice. Let us strive for victory. Let us all be champions, Let us raise all our flags at the finish line, and let us all proudly present them to our beautiful planet’s next generation.

70,2015,NIC,"Please receive the greetings of the people of Nicaragua and our President, Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra.

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.23
We wish the new President of the General Assembly success in the responsibilities that he has undertaken.
Today I come to the General Assembly to express the position of Nicaragua and that of our President, Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra. I shall therefore deliver the message on behalf of our Head of State and Government.
“This year, the General Assembly at its seventieth session commemorates the seventieth anniversary of our Organization. Seven decades ago, 51 States signed the Charter of the United Nations. Nicaragua is a founding State. The world was, at that time, emerging from a terrible war, and humankind was crying out for ‘peace, peace, peace’, as our immortal poet Rubén Darío said. Since 24 October 1945, the United Nations has projected to the world the image of an entity that would bring peace, but, from the time of its founding until today, its stated objectives have been frustrated.
“As we celebrate its seventieth anniversary, we are now 193 Member States, and the Organization was created in an entirely different world. Now, it must be transformed. We live on a planet with more people, and we are threatened by numerous and highly complex challenges. It is a world where egotism, arrogance and interference have completely altered and dismantled the right to peace, sovereign security and life for millions of human beings. We must therefore reflect deeply before reinventing, democratizing and recasting the United Nations. We want an Organization with equal rights for all its Members and one that more effectively meets the challenges of justice; equitable, sustainable, secure and sovereign development; and, above all, peace.
“The increasing greed of global capitalism, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, has caused wars and created, fostered, cultivated and exploited fanaticism and terrorism, which have, in turn, spread insecurity and destruction, and caused all kinds of crises — crises of infinite proportions and ramifications with war, food, the environmental, labour and humanitarian matters at their heart.
“The forced and brutal displacement of thousands of people, including the elderly, children and entire families, from countries that were
previously developed, such as Syria, Libya and Iraq, and from sub-Saharan Africa, lays bare the true nature of wars, terrorism, and the conflicts that we are experiencing. They have been created and fuelled by the greed of the empire of global capitalism. We have all said that that situation will get worse unless we act together to address and resolve the causes of so much distress, barbarism and catastrophe.
“Our Organization should promote respect, peace, sovereign security, justice and solidarity among human beings. The Organization must respond in the face of that barbaric intervention in and interruption of the tranquillity and the right to prosperity in the lives of millions of families of countries and entire populations. The Organization must respond to the challenges of our time with measures and activities that reflect the supreme interests of people — respect, the inviolability of sovereignty, the recognition of national natural resources and the promotion of security, justice and peace.
“We must not pass over the fact that the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was hindered by the terrible impact of wars and terrorism, created and encouraged by the imperialist empires. Similarly, climate imbalance, or climate change — the unusual frequency of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, disasters, epidemics, droughts, floods, landslides, all known calamities — have shown no mercy in the most impoverished countries. The peoples and countries that had fully implemented the MDGs, such as Libya, Syria and Iraq, have witnessed interventions and been devastated by terrorism, which was promoted to sustain imperialist invasions and wars. All those actions have been disguised as internal conflicts, brought about in an effort to seize and control our natural resources. There is no region on the planet where the imperialist hand has not left its mark, in the form of intrigue, aggression, manipulation and all kinds of interference directed against legitimate democratic processes, intended to weaken Governments, influence institutions, undermine harmony and engineer self-serving disruptions in the social, political and economic lives of our peoples.
“In Latin America and the Caribbean, we have reiterated our wish to declare our region a
15-29664 11/25

A/70/PV.23 01/10/2015
zone of peace and equitable development and our commitment to creating conditions in each country and in the region that will enable us to achieve, through dialogue and collaboration, firm and enduring peace and justice.
“To carry out the outstanding work under the MDGs and the implementation of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), we need to restore peace, sovereign security, respect for independence, protection of the natural resources of every population and respect for the dignity and cultures of all peoples. To work for justice, equality and development requires the establishment of a culture of meeting, dialogue and consensus, and it requires recovering the essential values of humankind. It necessitates putting an end to the wars and terrorism that have been created and fuelled. It also requires the constructive work of dialogue and the respectful affirmation of sovereign security and peace.
“Our Government of national reconciliation and unity has worked to eradicate poverty, as the national and international indicators show. As we fulfil that ongoing commitment, and as our Government, country and people are committed to the rights, welfare and security of Nicaraguan families, we propose here in this Hall that the United Nations take on the responsibility of addressing the very necessary battles to come.
“We must work for justice, peace, respect, dialogue and sovereign security in the world. To do that, we must bring about the necessary changes so that the Organization can serve the interests of all its Members. We would like to emphasize that during his presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session, in 2008, Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann developed some ideas and proposals in fulfilment of Nicaragua’s mandate to establish the basis for a discussion of such changes in a draft document on the reinvention of the United Nations. We believe that only when the United Nations is equitable and democratic, recast, re-created and fit for the purpose of serving the world and humankind in the twenty-first century, can we tackle the great challenges of our time.
“Our Government and our people advocate for a world with values, in which human beings bring out the best in each other and foster the best possible conditions for a just, sustainable, equitable, secure,
sovereign development and in which advances in science and technology in all areas of our lives are accessible to all and shared by all. The Government and the people of Nicaragua hope that the twenty- first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris will result in a commitment to climate justice as well as concluding an indispensable policy of indemnization translated into direct and unconditional cooperation. The carbon emitters and those who are responsible for despoiling and degrading our planet and causing imbalances must recognize our losses and help to promote the recovery of Mother Earth and restore its right to health and life and the right to health and life of the peoples of the world.
“Nicaragua calls for a world of solidarity and complementarity and a reshaped United Nations in which everyone’s interests are served and all Member States can listen and talk to each other on equal footing. We also call for the United Nations agencies to play a respectful, responsible and ethical role, devoid of any form of interference and intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign States.
“We come with greetings from the people of Nicaragua and their hope that the seventieth anniversary and the commitment we make will result in a transparent and deep process of reflection on how we can change and reinvent the Organization to make it democratic. Nicaragua, the land of Darío and Sandino, blessed and always free, is committed to the initiative to recreate, reinvent and recast the United Nations and adapt it to the growing demands of a democratic Organization that serves the supreme interests of sovereign security, justice and peace in the world. I hope that we united nations will fulfil that role, that we will promote dialogue, respect, understanding, sovereignty, security, peace and a future without interference or dependency, and that we will work together on an equal footing, with everyone, for everyone, for the well-being of all. Let it be so.”
That ends the address that President of Nicaragua, Mr. Daniel Ortega Saavedra, asked me to deliver on his behalf to the General Assembly on 1 October 2015.
"
70,2015,LBN,"It is my pleasure, at the outset, to congratulate the President for presiding over the work of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I also take this opportunity to thank Mr. Sam Kutesa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda, for the efforts exerted throughout his presidency of the Assembly during its sixty-ninth session.
On the seventieth anniversary marking the establishment of the United Nations, in which my country had the honour of contributing by way of the drafting of the Charter of the United Nations, I would like to stress Lebanon’s commitment in fully assuming its active role as a member of the international community in order to fulfil the noble aims unanimously approved by all nations: chiefly, safeguarding international peace and security, the right of peoples to self-determination and respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings.
We speak about the fundamental rights of human beings; in our region that concept is withering away, day after day, under the pressure of wars; dimming before an ever growing shadow hiding behind the veil of religion; and completely disintegrating when faced with the barbaric colonization practised by the State of Israel, while it seeks to hide under a modern and democratic cloak. Before the eyes of the entire world, nations in our region are disintegrating. Millions are leaving their homes, wandering off to the unknown.
There is Aylan: the 3-year-old child seen earlier this month by the entire world, after his body washed ashore towards his eternal resting place. His tragedy sums up the prevailing status of fundamental human rights in our region. His picture describes the story of a tormented people drifting in the sea without direction, or packed on sidewalks in cities and train stations, waiting for a permit, or a visa or simply a meal. The narrative has far outpaced any political, military or legal framework, to put forth a major question related to the present and the future of humankind.

We have all followed the efforts made on the part of some European countries to accommodate additional numbers of refugees on their territory. Those efforts are rooted in the cultural and civilizational heritage rooted in the bitter experience of devastating wars. Yet we continue to believe that the best solution to the problem, and the least expensive for Syria, the neighbouring countries and the world, is to tackle the tragedy directly and deal with its root causes.
Lebanon reiterates its call to the international community, especially all prominent world Powers, to rise above reluctance and wavering and to stop the fighting on Syrian territory, whose price is the blood of the Syrians. We urge them to end the ongoing massacre by fostering a political solution that safeguards the country’s unity, independence and territorial integrity, while fulfilling the Syrian people’s aspirations for a free and dignified life.
That call does not stem only from the links of neighborhood, kinship, history and common interests between the Syrian and Lebanese peoples, but also from Lebanon’s firm interest in ending the Syrian crisis because of the heavy burden of the massive waves of displaced persons, dubbed by the United Nations itself as a “national disaster”.
If Europe, with its sizeable capacity and generous humanity, has been confused by the sight of thousands of displaced persons suddenly appearing in its cities, Lebanon, with its limited space and scarce capacity, has been hosting, over the past four years, 1.5 million displaced Syrians, amounting to one third of its population. Lebanon’s public infrastructure and host communities have been exhausted maximally at a time of steadily declining international assistance due to the so-called donor fatigue.
While upholding its international obligations, Lebanon reiterates its appeal to donor countries to fulfil their commitments, and even to increase their financial contributions, in order to provide direct assistance to Lebanese public institutions and host communities, according to the response plan launched by Lebanon last December in collaboration with the United Nations. We firmly stress the principle of shared responsibility and burden-sharing among countries, while underlining the importance of establishing safe areas or buffer zones for refugees in Syria and setting up collection centres on the border.
The problem of the displaced population is only one facet of the many negative repercussions Lebanon has endured due to the neighbouring war. Perhaps the most daunting consequence of the conflict is the terrorism, which has demanded steep sacrifices. It is no secret that for more than a year now a group of our military forces is still being held by terrorist groups, and we are still exerting tremendous efforts to free them.
Based on a firm political resolution and efficient security action, we have succeeded in addressing the scourge of terrorism. Our people has proved to the world that Lebanon is not an incubator of terrorism meddling with some countries of the region under the cover of Islam — the religion of tolerance, love and moderation. The increasing responsibilities assumed by our military and security apparatus in the fight against terrorism have heightened our determination to strengthen our forces as a main pillar of security, stability and social harmony in the country. In stressing the need to address its root causes, Lebanon renews its commitment to fight terrorism in all its forms. We reaffirm our readiness to cooperate in the framework of a joint international effort, undertaken by the Security Council, aimed at eradicating terrorism and its sources of financing.
Despite the numerous political crises that Lebanon now faces — chief among them the vacuum created by the absence of a President of the Republic — Lebanon is proud to be a paragon of diversity and an oasis of coexistence among the members of various religions and sects. That is at a time when developments in the Middle East continue to threaten the social, cultural and religious diversity of the region. We believe that safeguarding the integrity of Lebanon is tantamount to protecting a vital remnant of pluralism in the Levant. Therefore, consolidating stability in the country requires strengthening its political, security and socioeconomic components, and it entails a consensual decision on the part of our brothers and friends. That needs to be done in order to prevent regional polarization from influencing Lebanon, help the Lebanese people end the current political vacuum and paralysis and bolster the work of the constitutional institutions with the immediate election of a new President of the Republic.
We followed the recent agreement between Iran and the five permanent Security Council members and Germany with great interest. We now hope that that development will open a new chapter in international relations, marking the beginning of progress in the region and improvement in the political situation in
15-29562 53/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
Lebanon. We consider that the baseline requirement for successful and normal relations among the countries in the region, which is in the best interests of their peoples, is a commitment to good-neighbourly policy, respect of States’ sovereignty and non-interference in their internal affairs, security and stability.
While marking the ninth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), Lebanon reaffirms its commitment to all the provisions of that resolution, based on the belief that it will strengthen stability and security in southern Lebanon and will contribute to extending the State’s authority over its entire territory. Lebanon reiterates its call to the international community to compel Israel to cease its violations of Lebanese sovereignty and cooperate with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). I take this opportunity to thank the UNIFIL command, structures, troops and all participating countries in order to demarcate the rest of the Blue Line and ensure that the Israelis withdraw immediately from the northern Ghajar area, Shaba’a farmlands and the Kfar Shouba Hills.
Lebanon denounces Israel’s continued occupation of Palestinian land and its blockade of the Gaza Strip. We call upon the international community to compel it to lift that inhumane blockade and ensure decent living conditions for the Palestinians. We condemn the repeated Israeli attacks on the Al-Aqsa Mosque and warn of their serious repercussions. We hold Israel responsible for the failure to reach a peaceful settlement to the conflict based on the two-State solution. In the meantime, we call upon the Security Council to take the appropriate action to resume negotiations, aimed at ending the occupation within a specified time frame, based on resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), the Madrid terms of reference and the Arab Peace Initiative. While Lebanon rejects the resettlement of refugees on
its territory, we also stress the right of Palestinians to return to their homeland, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.
A number of crises are roiling in the Middle East region, bringing upheaval. The time has come for the world to mobilize its energies and address them seriously, rather than ignoring them and shirking its responsibility. That is not only because the Levant is the spiritual and linguistic cradle for so much of humankind, but also because our humanitarian duty commands the international community to take action. And our undeniable interest requires us to contain the wildfire that is raging now and prevent it from spreading to everyone’s homes.
I call upon the countries of the world to shun their inaction and resignation and assume the responsibility of restoring security and stability in our region and ensure people’s right to a better future. The countries of the world must reach out and put an end to the death toll in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen, and in the land of peace, Palestine. I beseech the international community to reach out and restore the glow of the Levantine jewel, known as Lebanon, and ensure that our children’s right — which is the right of all children — to sail on the vessels of their dreams, rather than on the literal boats of humiliation and death, which are carrying them to foreign shores.
"
70,2015,LBY,"As the General Assembly gathers this year, we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. Certainly, we have accomplished a lot during the past 70 years in the economic field, in the protection of human rights and in the maintenance of international peace and security. However, the Organization also experienced failures because of the lack of appropriate structures to effectively deal with the continuous increase in the magnitude and number of challenges as well as their nature, compared to those that existed at the founding of the United Nations.
It goes without saying that the maintenance of international peace and security remains the first priority for the Organization. It is also the biggest challenge we face in an evolving world that is confronted by new complications, such as terrorism, the proliferation of armed conflicts, natural disasters and climate change. All these result in humanitarian crises that have manifested themselves in different forms, such as refugees, internally displaced persons and illegal immigrants.
Today, the United Nations Member States are in need more than ever of consultation, cooperation and mutual assistance to address common challenges and to ensure a better future for the generations to come. The Charter of the United Nations stipulates that the Organization was established to save future generations from the scourge of war. However, that goal remains elusive. Although armed conflicts between nations
15-29568 17/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
have been reduced, ideological, ethnic and sectarian conflicts within States continue to spread dramatically. That spread is accompanied by unprecedented violations of human rights over and above the spread of terrorist organizations. The emergence of terrorism is a key driver of conflict and instability in many countries, especially in the Middle East and Africa.
We in Libya represent a fledgling democracy seeking to find its way in order to take hold as an added value in the minds of the people and to transform the country into one with transparent, democratic, effective and stable institutions. However, the spread of weapons and armed groups, some of which have turned to criminal and terrorist behaviour, in addition to the country’s exploitation by some people with personal interests, have all resulted in the spread of chaos in the country and weakened the central authority. In addition, that spread has constituted a real threat to democratic transformation and has encouraged the emergence of terrorist organizations and the recruitment of additional foreign terrorist fighters.
During the past year, Libya has witnessed the emergence of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or Daesh, an outcome of and ally to Ansar al-Sharia, which asserts control over the towns of Derna and Sirte, with a view to taking the two towns as starting points to assert full control throughout Libya and to exploit Libya’s resources to finance the establishment of an extremist entity that refuses to recognize the national State and fights against democracy. That entity harbours the aim of extending from Mauritania to Bangladesh, thereby subjecting the entire region to the law of the jungle, while claiming to follow the law of Islam. However, that ideology has been totally rejected and resisted by the Libyan people by way of every force available under the leadership of the legitimate authorities, represented by the elected House of Representatives and its duly formed Government.
Those groups have been and remain an essential part of the militia alliance of Libya Dawn, which has seized the capital, Tripoli, and repeatedly announced that it will continue to support Ansar Al-Sharia in Benghazi, while describing them as revolutionaries.
We realize that all of those terrorist and extremist groups are nothing but tools to implement the policies of foreign countries that have persisted in providing them with arms and ammunition. Furthermore, they have facilitated the arrival of foreign fighters in Benghazi,
Sirte and Derna, to participate in the fighting against the Libyan army, which is locked in a fierce war to rid Libya of terrorism by whatever modest means it has at its disposal.
The efforts of the Libyan authorities in the fight against terrorism and to protect Libya from terrorist attacks is being hampered by external support for terrorism activities, in addition to the continuing arms embargo and the insistence of the Security Council in contradicting its decisions by its non-approval of the Libyan Government’s requests for an exemption from the arms embargo, in order to arm the Libyan army.
Unfortunately, some of the permanent members of the Council have justified such conduct as if to avoid a negative impact on the Libyan political dialogue, which we understand has led to a draft political agreement on 11 July that was accepted by the legitimate authority after it made significant concessions, and initialled by most of the parties involved. However, that same agreement has been rejected by the so-called General National Congress (GNC), which represents the militias that occupy Tripoli. Those militias are allied with Al-Qaida and Ansar Al-Sharia, supporting them with arms and fighters in the war against the Libyan army that is taking place in the cities of Benghazi and Derna.
The threat of terrorism on the part of the Islamic State, Al-Qaida and Ansar Al-Sharia is not limited only to Libya. The terrorists view Libya as nothing more than a base camp rich with significant resources ripe for exploitation to finance its operations in North Africa and the Sahel region, as well as Europe, if they were to control it. All United Nations States Members should be aware of the gravity of the position taken by the Security Council. Therefore, with respect to matters of international peace and security, they should exercise pressure towards the lifting of the arms embargo on the Libyan army, accelerate the approval of the application for exemption from the arms embargo and provide assistance to the Libyan Government in the area of security, according to the provisions of Security Council resolution 2214 (2015).
I can assure the Assembly that nothing divides the Libyan people and that the vast majority is seeking any possible means to put an end to the unjustified fighting among brothers, and restore the security and stability of the country. Nevertheless, they are hostage to the armed groups, and thus unable to express their views.

Hundreds of thousands of Libyans have become internally displaced persons or refugees aspiring to return to their homes as soon as possible. That could be fulfilled only through an agreement on a strong Government that enjoys the confidence of all Libyans, controls all of the Libyan territory and is supported by the international community. We appreciate the effort made by the United Nations Support Mission in Libya to facilitate dialogue among the Libyan parties and form a Government of national accord that represents all Libyans, while placing the national interests above all other considerations.
The House of Representatives, as the legitimate authority elected by all Libyans, was and remains supportive of dialogue as a strategic option to resolve the political and security crisis in Libya. The House of Representatives made every possible concessions to encourage the illegitimate party to disassociate itself from terrorism and join the dialogue table, with the aim of sparing Libyans from more bloodshed and putting an end to the destruction of Libyan cities.
However, we have noticed increasingly intransigent positions and misinterpretations of the flexibility shown by the House of Representatives. It seems that such flexibility has been misunderstood, even by Mr. Bernadino León, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, who tried to bring us back to square one by unraveling all that had been achieved in the past 10 months through dialogue and negotiations. In that regard, I want to emphasize from this rostrum the following.
The House of Representatives is committed to dialogue as an approach to resolving the security and institutional crisis in Libya, but it will not agree to any regression regarding that which has been approved by the majority so far.
No agreement may be imposed on a future Government to take any step whatsoever in favour of any terrorist organization that has been listed by a Security Council sanctions committee.
The war against terrorism in Benghazi, Derna and Sirte cannot be part of a ceasefire arrangement under the agreement, unless it includes surrender on the part of the terrorists and the turning in of their weapons.
The House of Representatives hopes to receive a final draft of an agreement that does not reward the
perpetrators of crimes, including the destruction of State property and forced, armed seizure of the capital.
In the case of the continued intransigence of the General National Congress in rejecting the agreement, the House of Representatives calls on the boycotting members to advance the national interests and the interests of their constituents on any and all matters. They are called upon to disassociate themselves from the extremist militias and to join the House of Representatives in order to participate in the selection of an inclusive Government of national accord that excludes the terrorist groups. We call on the international community to exercise influence in that direction.
This year, the Mediterranean Sea has witnessed an unprecedented wave of illegal migration coming from Africa and Asia and heading towards Europe. Sadly, we have taken note of the loss of thousands of lives by drowning at sea. In that regard, we express our condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims.
We reiterate Libya’s position in support of all international efforts seeking to reduce the risks to illegal migrants in the Mediterranean, based on respect for the principles of international law, particularly respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States.
We express Libya’s readiness to contribute, within the limits of its capacity, to prevent the smuggling of migrants and to rescue lives in the Mediterranean. We also emphasize that the humanitarian crisis must be addressed comprehensively, in consultation with the countries of origin, transit and destination, and while taking into account the need to address the root causes of illegal migration in general and reasons for the large increase in the numbers of migrants passing through Libya in recent months.
The security approach to the problem of migrant smuggling is insufficient. Libya believes that using force against smuggling boats off the Libyan coast may increase the complexity of the Libyan crisis, and will not contribute to reducing the migrant phenomenon. That can be achieved only by providing the legitimate Libyan Government with the capacity to extend its authority over all Libyan territory and to control its borders, including the necessary capacity-building assistance in that area, especially the arming of the Libyan army with the necessary equipment and training.

Libya cautions against any foreign military activity conducted without its consent and control in Libyan territorial waters or within its exclusive economic zone that could harm fishing activities and lead to the plundering of its marine living resources.
Peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved in the midst of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, which denies the rights of the Palestinian people and seeks in all possible ways to Judaize the city of Jerusalem. The occupation flies in the face of all international resolutions on the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, in particular on the right of return and the right to establish an independent State with full sovereignty over its territory, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Libya demands that the siege imposed on the Palestinian people be lifted and that they be provided with protection. The Israeli occupation authorities must be compelled to stop all acts of violence and intimidation against the Palestinian people and to comply with all international resolutions, especially with regard to the return of refugees to their homes and the cessation of settlement activities and of the repeated attacks against the holy sanctuary of Al-Haram Al-Sharif in Jerusalem.
We condemn all atrocities against the Syrian people and express our support for all international efforts aimed at finding a peaceful settlement that will affirm the rights of the Syrian people to live in a dignified and democratic system that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms.
With regard to brotherly Yemen, we hope that the Arab coalition will restore security and stability to Yemen and help reach a peaceful solution to the crisis, under the supervision of its legitimate Government and on the basis of Security Council resolution 2216 (2015).
"
70,2015,CIV,"On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, and myself, I, like the Heads of State and Government who have preceded me in this Hall, would like to congratulate you warmly, Mr. President, on your election to the
26/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and to assure you of our support as you carry out your important and noble mission. I also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for the excellent work accomplished during his tenure. And I am especially pleased to salute His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of our Organization, for his continued commitment to peace, security and development around the world.
As we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, which coincides with the adoption of a new cycle of development — a bearer of hope — it is impossible not to feel moved by the intolerable human tragedy of migration that is taking place before our eyes, and I take this opportunity to bow to the memory of so many who have been lost in the Mediterranean. In the face of that unprecedented humanitarian drama, the international community must take a concerted, comprehensive and coherent approach to finding a humane response to the crisis of the migrants and refugees who are risking their lives to flee poverty, misery, violence and wars. We must all share in that common responsibility.
In 1945, when the world was still just emerging from the greatest military and humanitarian tragedy of our time, a few States, joined later by others, brought the United Nations to the baptismal font. The adoption of our Organization’s founding Charter inspired a great hope in the nations and peoples of the world, a hope of seeing humankind freed from the scourge of war to able to build a new world of peace, security and social progress. The theme of this year’s general debate, “The United Nations at 70: a new commitment to action” offers us an excellent opportunity to take stock of the Organization’s achievements in relation to its Charter, and to consider its future in a world assailed by every possible kind of change.
The United Nations enjoys enormous authority and plays an irreplaceable role in helping humankind to progress on the basis of the Organization’s three essential pillars: peace, security and development. The 70 years of its existence have unquestionably been marked by its continually growing involvement in promoting democracy and the independence of nations. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, called the world’s attention to cases of torture and massive violations of human rights and created unprecedented international pressure for greater respect for human rights on a global scale.
When considering the Organization’s major achievements, it is also important to note the end of apartheid in South Africa, in which the United Nations was one of the main architects. It has played a similar role in promoting the rights of women, and in that regard, we should emphasize the historic World Conference on Women, held in Mexico in 1975, and the memorable Fourth Conference in Beijing in 1995, which enabled us to define priorities and standards for women’s rights and gender equality.
In the area of peace and security, peacekeeping operations around the world have helped save many lives and restore stability. In that connection, I would like to reiterate the Ivorian people’s gratitude for the invaluable role that the United Nations played and continues to play at our side. Thanks to its valuable support, Côte d’Ivoire has begun to make progress again, once again finding itself on the road to stability, growth and economic and social development.
The successes that have been achieved under the leadership of the United Nations should not blind us to the many challenges still facing the Organization and humankind. Indeed, peace and security are everywhere under threat. Transnational crime is expanding and threatening international trade. Incitement to extremism, including by terrorist groups, is gaining ground. Boko Haram, which has become what amounts to the Islamic State in West Africa, continues to sow desolation and terror. Cybercrime is growing, and poverty, despite efforts to eradicate it, remains an abiding concern and an obstacle to the development and well-being of peoples.
Besides such threats, we are witnessing the persistence of internal and regional conflicts in many parts of the world. The international community must be vigilant regarding the conflicts in the Middle East and the situations in Syria, Libya and Western Sahara. Concerning the issue of Western Sahara, Côte d’Ivoire would like to affirm its support for the negotiation process being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations, and we call on the parties to display a spirit of compromise in order to settle the dispute within the framework of the relevant Security Council resolutions and Morocco’s autonomy plan.
Our peoples have great and urgent expectations, and they believe that it is up to the United Nations to demonstrate a new commitment to action. That commitment should be embodied in the implementation

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
of the programmes of the new post-2015 development agenda in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which the Assembly adopted at the special Summit devoted to promoting the new Sustainable Development Goals.
The new 2030 Agenda gives us a historic opportunity to promote an ambitious development programme aimed at significantly reducing poverty and hunger around the world, improving people’s health and education and fighting the adverse effects of climate change together. It should also promote good governance measures, which will help to redistribute wealth to the poor and vulnerable and bring back a genuine partnership for development so that we can build a world of prosperity, equality, security and peace, in the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations.
Poverty, terrorism, epidemics, food and climate insecurity — today’s new threats to international peace and security — make fertile ground for the intolerance, fundamentalism and extremism of every sort that threaten the fragile edifice of world peace to which our populations legitimately aspire.
We cannot deny that the world is facing a time of great challenges, but it is also true that we have a historic opportunity to strengthen the foundations for inclusive development and a better world for both current and future generations. I am therefore delighted that this seventieth anniversary coincides with a year that gives us hope. Indeed, the third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa from 13 to 16 July, enabled us to agree on ways to implement the 2030 Agenda that we have just adopted. We need to finish the job at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in December in Paris, in order to achieve a binding global commitment that will enable us to fight effectively against global warming.
The new development programme that we have just adopted capitalizes on the experience of the Millennium Development Goals and holistically integrates the three dimensions of sustainable development, namely the economic, social and environmental dimensions. It puts us on the right path to make the transition to a better world for all humankind.
While we are justified in celebrating the new Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals as the
new consensual paradigm for development, the most difficult task is still ahead of us. Each State needs to operationalize all of those programmes through the establishment of appropriate policies and reforms at the national level.
That is the underlying purpose of the national development plan that has been drawn up by the Ivorian Government for the period 2016-2020 with a view to making Côte d’Ivoire an emerging country by 2020. Our objective is to halve the poverty rate in our country. With regard to the economy, according to the World Bank’s report Doing Business 2015, for the second consecutive year Côte d’Ivoire is among the 10 countries in the world that have implemented the largest number of reforms to improve the business environment.
As a result of those reforms, Côte d’Ivoire has been among the front-runners of high-growth countries in Africa and throughout the world since 2012. The average growth rate of the gross domestic product for the period 2012-2014 was above 9 per cent. During the past three years the per capita income has improved by about 20 per cent. In education, after introducing free schooling in 2011, the Government has made school attendance compulsory for all children aged from 6 to 16 years, beginning with the current school year, in order to translate into reality the right of all girls and boys in our country to high-quality education and training. With regard to health, in order to provide medical coverage for all Ivorians, we have initiated a system of universal health coverage, thereby enabling the most disadvantaged to be treated in the various health units of our country.
The year 2015, which is slipping rapidly away, is pivotal also because on 25 October our open and inclusive general elections will begin. In that connection, I welcome the decision of the Security Council in resolution 2226 (2015), of 25 June 2015, to authorize the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire to provide logistical support to Côte d’Ivoire during the elections. For its part, the Government of Côte d’Ivoire, which has established a permanent framework for dialogue with the opposition, will do everything possible to ensure the credibility of the electoral process in order to consolidate the newly found peace.
With regard to the national reconciliation process, the National Commission for Reconciliation and Compensation for Victims, which the Government
28/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
established to complete the work of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, is currently in the process of compensating victims. The demobilization, disarmament and reintegration process has been successfully completed with an 85 per cent reintegration rate of ex-combatants. All those results will be sustainable only if the economy performs well. The economic recovery we have seen over the past four years, with a constantly increasing growth rate, has benefited from the support of our partners, and I would like to thank them.
I would like to conclude by emphasizing that the image of a better world conjured up by the founding fathers of our Organization is more compelling than ever. Our adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development opens up new prospects for development, for the benefit of peoples everywhere. We therefore appeal to the proven leadership of the United Nations and call for the decisive impact it can make in helping to push back the frontiers of poverty and to provide humankind with better access to safe drinking water, a rapid reduction in infant mortality, enhanced food security and a healthy environment.
Time is of the essence. The time has come for action.
"
70,2015,USA,"Seventy years after the founding of the United Nations it is worth reflecting on what the members of this body, working together, have helped to achieve. Out of the ashes of the Second World War, having witnessed the unthinkable power of the atomic age, the United States has worked with many nations in the Assembly to prevent a third world war — by forging alliances with old adversaries; by supporting the steady emergence of strong democracies accountable to their people and not to any foreign Power; and by building an international system that imposes a cost on those who choose conflict over cooperation, an order that recognizes the dignity and equal worth of all people.
That has been the work of seven decades. That is the ideal that this body has, at its best, pursued. Of course, there have been too many times when, collectively, we have fallen short of those ideals. Over the seven decades, terrible conflicts have claimed untold victims. But we have pressed forward, slowly, steadily, to make a system of international rules and norms that are better and stronger and more consistent.
It is that international order that has underwritten unparalleled advances in human liberty and prosperity. It is that collective endeavour that has brought about diplomatic cooperation among the world’s major Powers and buttressed a global economy that has lifted more than a billion people from poverty. It is those international principles that have helped constrain bigger countries from imposing their will on smaller ones and have advanced the emergence of democracy and development and individual liberty on every continent.
That progress is real. It can be documented in lives saved, agreements forged, diseases conquered and mouths fed. And yet we come together today knowing that the march of human progress never travels in a straight line, that our work is far from complete and that dangerous currents risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world.
Today we are seeing the collapse of strongmen and fragile States breeding conflict and driving innocent men, women and children across borders on an epic scale. Brutal networks of terror have stepped into the vacuum. Technologies that empower individuals are now also exploited by those who spread disinformation, suppress dissent or radicalize our youth. Global capital flows have powered growth and investment, but they have also increased the risk of contagion, weakened the bargaining power of workers and accelerated inequality.
How should we respond to those trends? There are those who argue that the ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are unachievable or out of date, a legacy of a postwar era not suited to our own. In effect, they are arguing for a return to the rules that applied for most of human history and that predate this institution — the belief that power is a zero-sum game, that might makes right, that strong States must impose their will on weaker ones, that the rights of individuals do not matter and that in a time of rapid change, order must be imposed by force.
On that basis, we see some major Powers assert themselves in ways that contravene international law. We see an erosion of the democratic principles and human rights that are fundamental to this institution’s mission. Information is strictly controlled and the space for civil society restricted. We are told that such retrenchment is required to beat back disorder; that it is the only way to stamp out terrorism and prevent foreign meddling. In accordance with that logic, we should support tyrants like Bashar Al-Assad, who drops barrel bombs to massacre innocent children, because the alternative is surely worse.
This increasing scepticism of our international order can also be found in the most advanced democracies. We see greater polarization and more frequent gridlock, with movements on the far right, and sometimes the left, that insist on stopping the trade that binds our fates to other nations or calling for the building of walls to keep out immigrants. Most ominously, we see the fears of ordinary people being exploited through appeals to sectarianism, tribalism, racism or anti-Semitism; appeals to a glorious past before the body politic was infected by those who look different or worship God differently — a politics of us versus them.
The United States is not immune to this. Even as our economy is growing and our troops have largely returned from Iraq and Afghanistan, we see in our debates about America’s role in the world a notion of strength that is defined by opposition to old enemies, perceived adversaries — a rising China or resurgent Russia, a revolutionary Iran or an Islam that is incompatible with peace. We see arguments that the only strength that matters for the United States is bellicose words and shows of military force, and that cooperation and diplomacy will not work.
As President of the United States, I am mindful of the dangers that we face. They cross my desk every 
morning. I lead the strongest military that the world has ever known, and I will never hesitate to protect my country or our allies, unilaterally and by force where necessary. But I stand before the Assembly today believing in my core that we, the nations of the world, cannot return to the old ways of conflict and coercion. We cannot look backwards. We live in an integrated world, one in which we all have a stake in one another’s success.
We cannot turn back those forces of integration. No nation here in the Assembly can insulate itself from the threat of terrorism, the risk of financial contagion, the flow of migrants or the danger of a warming planet. The disorder we see is not driven solely by competition between nations or by any single ideology. If we cannot work together more effectively, we will all suffer the consequences.
That is true for the United States as well. No matter how powerful our military, how strong our economy, we understand the United States cannot solve the world’s problems alone. In Iraq, the United States learned the hard lesson that even with hundreds of thousands of brave, effective troops and trillions of dollars from our Treasury, it cannot by itself impose stability on a foreign land. Unless we work with other nations under the mantle of international norms, principles and law that offers legitimacy to our efforts, we will not succeed. And unless we work together to defeat the ideas that drive the various communities in a country like Iraq into conflict, any order that our militaries can impose will be temporary.
Just as force alone cannot impose order internationally, I believe in my core that repression cannot forge the social cohesion that nations need to succeed. The history of the last two decades proves that in today’s world, dictatorships are unstable. The strongmen of today become the spark of revolution tomorrow. You can jail your opponents, but you cannot imprison ideas. You can try to control access to information, but you cannot turn a lie into truth. It is not a conspiracy of United States-backed non-governmental organizations that exposes corruption and raises the expectations of people around the globe — it is technology, social media and the irreducible desire of people everywhere to make their own choices about how they are governed.
Indeed, I believe that in today’s world, the measure of strength is no longer defined by the control of territory. Lasting prosperity does not come solely from
the ability to access and extract raw materials. The strength of nations depends on the success of their people — their knowledge, innovation, imagination, creativity, drive and opportunity — and that, in turn, depends on individual rights, good governance and personal security. Both internal repression and foreign aggression are symptoms of a failure to provide that foundation.
Politics and solidarity that depend on demonizing others, that draw on religious sectarianism, narrow tribalism or jingoism, may at times look like strength in the moment, but over time their weakness will be exposed. And history tells us that the dark forces unleashed by this type of politics surely make all of us less secure. Our world has been there before. We gain nothing from going back.
Instead, I believe that we must go forward in pursuit of our ideals, not abandon them at this critical time. We must give expression to our best hopes, not our deepest fears. This institution was founded because men and women who came before us had the foresight to know that our nations are more secure when we uphold basic laws and norms and pursue a path of cooperation rather than conflict. And strong nations, above all, have a responsibility to uphold that international order.
Let me give a concrete example. After I took office, I made it clear that one of the principal achievements of the United Nations — the nuclear non-proliferation regime — was endangered by Iran’s violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. On that basis, the Security Council tightened sanctions on the Iranian Government, and many nations joined us to enforce them. Together, we showed that laws and agreements mean something. But we also understood that the goal of sanctions was not simply to punish Iran. Our objective was to test whether Iran could change course, accept constraints and allow the world to verify that its nuclear programme would be peaceful. For two years, the United States and our partners, including Russia and China, stuck together in complex negotiations. The result is a lasting, comprehensive deal that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon while allowing it to access peaceful energy. If the deal is fully implemented, the prohibition on nuclear weapons is strengthened, a potential war is averted and our world is safer. That is the strength of the international system when it works the way it should.
That same fidelity to international order guides our responses to other challenges around the world.
Consider Russia’s annexation of Crimea and further aggression in eastern Ukraine. America has few economic interests in Ukraine, and we recognize the deep and complex history between Russia and Ukraine. But we cannot stand by when the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation is flagrantly violated. If that happens without consequence in Ukraine, it could happen to any of the nations gathered here today. That is the basis of the sanctions that the United States and our partners impose on Russia. It is not a desire to return to a cold war.
Now, within Russia, State-controlled media may describe those events as an example of a resurgent Russia — a view shared, by the way, by a number of United States politicians and commentators who have always been deeply sceptical about Russia and seem to be convinced that a new cold war is in fact upon us. And yet look at the results. The Ukrainian people are more interested than ever in aligning with Europe instead of Russia. Sanctions have led to capital flight, a contracting economy, a fallen rouble and the emigration of more educated Russians.
Imagine if, instead, Russia had engaged in true diplomacy and worked with Ukraine and the international community to ensure that its interests were protected. That would be better for Ukraine, but also better for Russia and better for the world, which is why we continue to press for this crisis to be resolved in a way that allows a sovereign and democratic Ukraine to determine its future and control its territory. This is not because we want to isolate Russia — we do not — but because we want a strong Russia that is invested in working with us to strengthen the international system as a whole.
Similarly, in the South China Sea, the United States makes no claim on territory there. We do not adjudicate claims. But like every nation gathered here, we have an interest in upholding the basic principles of freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce, and in resolving disputes through international law, not the law of force. So we will defend those principles, while encouraging China and other claimants to resolve their differences peacefully. I say this while recognizing that diplomacy is hard, the outcomes are sometimes unsatisfying and it is rarely politically popular. But I believe that leaders of large nations in particular have an obligation to take those risks, precisely because we are strong enough to protect our interests if and when diplomacy fails.
I also believe that to move forward in this new era, we have to be strong enough to acknowledge when what we are doing is not working. For 50 years, the United States pursued a Cuba policy that failed to improve the lives of the Cuban people. We changed that. We continue to have differences with the Cuban Government. We will continue to stand up for human rights. But we address those issues through diplomatic relations, increased commerce and people-to-people ties. As those contacts yield progress, I am confident that our Congress will inevitably lift an embargo that should not be in place any more. Change will not come overnight to Cuba, but I am confident that openness, not coercion, will support the reforms and the better life that the Cuban people deserve, just as I believe that Cuba will find its success if it pursues cooperation with other nations.
Now, if it is in the interest of major Powers to uphold international standards, that is even more true for the rest of the community of nations. Look around the world. From Singapore to Colombia to Senegal, the facts show that nations succeed when they pursue an inclusive peace and prosperity within their borders and work cooperatively with countries beyond those borders.
That path is now available to a nation such as Iran, which, as of this moment, continues to deploy violent proxies to advance its interests. Those efforts may appear to give it leverage in disputes with its neighbours, but they fuel sectarian conflict that endangers the entire region and isolates Iran from the promise of trade and commerce. The Iranian people have a proud history and are filled with extraordinary potential. But chanting “Death to America” does not create jobs or make Iran more secure. If Iran chooses a different path, that will be good for the security of the region, good for the Iranian people and good for the world.
Of course, around the globe, we will continue to be confronted with nations that reject these lessons of history — places where civil strife, border disputes and sectarian wars give rise to terrorist enclaves and humanitarian disasters. Where order has completely broken down, we must act, but we will be stronger when we act together.
In such efforts, the United States will always do its part. We will do so mindful of the lessons of the past — not just the lessons of Iraq, but also the example of Libya, where we joined an international coalition
under a United Nations mandate to prevent a slaughter. Even as we helped the Libyan people bring an end to the reign of a tyrant, our coalition could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind. We are grateful to the United Nations for its efforts to forge a unity Government. We will help any legitimate Libyan Government as it works to bring the country together.
We also have to recognize that we must work more effectively in the future, as an international community, to build capacity for States that are in distress before they collapse. That is why we should celebrate the fact that, later today, the United States will join with more than 50 countries to enlist new capabilities — infantry, intelligence, helicopters, hospitals, and tens of thousands of troops — to strengthen United Nations peacekeeping. These new capabilities can prevent mass killing and ensure that peace agreements are more than words on paper. But we have to do it together. Together, we must strengthen our collective capacity to establish security where order has broken down and to support those who seek a just and lasting peace.
Nowhere is our commitment to international order more tested than in Syria. When a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people, that is not just a matter of one nation’s internal affairs. It breeds human suffering on an order of magnitude that affects us all. Likewise, when a terrorist group beheads captives, slaughters the innocent and enslaves women, that is not a single nation’s national security problem. It is an assault on humankind as a whole.
I have said before and I will repeat: there is no room to accommodate an apocalyptic cult like the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and the United States makes no apologies for using our military, as part of a broad coalition, to go after them. We do so with a determination to ensure that there will never be a safe haven for terrorists who carry out these crimes. We have demonstrated over more than a decade of relentless pursuit of Al-Qaida that we will not be outlasted by extremists.
While military power is necessary, it is not sufficient to resolve the situation in Syria. Lasting stability can take hold only when the people of Syria forge an agreement to live together peacefully. The United States is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict. But we must recognize that after so much bloodshed, so much carnage, there cannot be a return to the pre-war status quo.
Let us remember how this started. Al-Assad reacted to peaceful protests by escalating repression and killing that, in turn, created the environment for the current strife. And so Al-Assad and his allies cannot simply pacify the broad majority of a population that has been brutalized by chemical weapons and indiscriminate bombing. Yes, realism dictates that compromise will be required to end the fighting and, ultimately, stamp out ISIL. But realism also requires a managed transition away from Al-Assad and to a new leader, and an inclusive Government that recognizes there must be an end to this chaos so that the Syrian people can begin to rebuild.
We know that ISIL — which emerged out of the chaos of Iraq and Syria — depends on perpetual war to survive, but we also know that they gain adherents because of a poisonous ideology. Part of our job, together, is to work to reject such extremism that infects too many of our young people. Part of that effort must be a continued rejection by Muslims of those who distort Islam to preach intolerance and promote violence. It must also involve a rejection by non-Muslims of the ignorance that equates Islam with terrorism.
This work will take time. There are no easy answers to Syria, and there are no simple answers to the changes that are taking place in much of the Middle East and North Africa. But so many families need help right now; they do not have time. That is why the United States is increasing the number of refugees whom we welcome within our borders. That is why we will continue to be the largest donor of assistance to support those refugees. Today we are launching new efforts to ensure that our people and our businesses, our universities and our non-governmental organizations can help as well, because in the faces of suffering families, our nation of immigrants sees itself.
Of course, in the old ways of thinking, the plight of the powerless, the plight of refugees, the plight of the marginalized did not matter. They were on the periphery of the world’s concerns. Today, our concern for them is driven not just by conscience, but should also be driven by self-interest. Helping people who have been pushed to the margins of our world is not mere charity; it is a matter of collective security. The purpose of this institution is not merely to avoid conflict; it is to galvanize the collective action that makes life better on this planet.
The commitments we have made to the Sustainable Development Goals speak to this truth. I believe that 
capitalism has been the greatest creator of wealth and opportunity that the world has ever known. But from big cities to rural villages around the world, we also know that prosperity is still cruelly out of reach for too many. As His Holiness Pope Francis reminds us, we are stronger when we value the least among these and see them as equal in dignity to ourselves and our sons and our daughters.
We can roll back preventable disease and end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. We can stamp out pandemics that recognize no borders. That work may not be on television right now, but as we demonstrated in reversing the spread of Ebola, it can save more lives than anything else we can do. Together, we can eradicate extreme poverty and erase barriers to opportunity. But this requires a sustained commitment to our people so farmers can feed more people, so entrepreneurs can start a business without paying a bribe, so young people have the skills they need to succeed in this modern, knowledge-based economy.
We can promote growth through trade that meets a higher standard, and that is what we are doing through the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a trade agreement that encompasses nearly 40 per cent of the global economy, an agreement that will open markets while protecting the rights of workers and protecting the environment that enables development to be sustained.
We can roll back the pollution that we put in our skies and help economies lift people out of poverty without condemning our children to the ravages of an ever-warming climate. The same ingenuity that produced the Industrial Age and the Computer Age allows us to harness the potential of clean energy. No country can escape the ravages of climate change. And there is no stronger sign of leadership than putting future generations first. The United States will work with every nation that is willing to do its part so that we can come together in Paris to decisively confront this challenge.
Finally, regarding our vision for the future of the Assembly, my belief in moving forward rather than backwards requires us to defend the democratic principles that allow societies to succeed. Let me start from a simple premise. Catastrophes like what we are seeing in Syria do not take place in countries where there is genuine democracy and respect for the universal values this institution is supposed to defend.
I recognize that democracy is going to take different forms in different parts of the world. The very idea of a people governing themselves depends upon government giving expression to their unique culture, their unique history, their unique experiences. But some universal truths are self-evident. No person wants to be imprisoned for peaceful worship. No woman should ever be abused with impunity, no girl should be barred from attending school. There should be freedom to peacefully petition those in power without fear of arbitrary laws. These are not ideas of one country or one culture. They are fundamental to human progress. They are a cornerstone of this institution.
I realize that in many parts of the world there is a different view — a belief that strong leadership must tolerate no dissent. I hear it not only from America’s adversaries, but — privately, at least — I also hear it from some of our friends. I disagree. I believe a Government that suppresses peaceful dissent is not showing strength. It is showing weakness and it is showing fear.
History shows that regimes that fear their own people will eventually crumble, but strong institutions built on the consent of the governed endure long after any one individual is gone. That is why our strongest leaders, from George Washington to Nelson Mandela, have elevated the importance of building strong, democratic institutions over a thirst for perpetual power. Leaders who amend constitutions to stay in office only acknowledge that they failed to build a successful country for their people, because none of us lasts forever. It tells us that power is something they cling to for its own sake rather than for the betterment of those whom they purport to serve.
I understand that democracy is frustrating. Democracy in the United States is certainly imperfect. At times it can be dysfunctional. But democracy — the constant struggle to extend rights to more of our people, to give more people a voice — is what allowed us to become the most powerful nation in the world. It is not simply a matter of principle; it is not an abstraction. Democracy, inclusive democracy, makes countries stronger. When opposition parties can seek power peacefully through the ballot, a country draws upon new ideas. When a free media can inform the public, corruption and abuse are exposed and can be rooted out. When civil society thrives, communities can solve problems that Governments cannot necessarily solve alone. When immigrants are welcomed, countries are 
more productive and more vibrant. When girls can go to school, get a job and pursue unlimited opportunities, that is when a country realizes its full potential.
That is what I believe is America’s greatest strength. Not everybody in America agrees with me. That is part of democracy. I believe that the fact that one can walk the streets of this city right now and pass churches and synagogues and temples and mosques where people worship freely; the fact that our nation of immigrants mirrors the diversity of the world — one can find people from everywhere here in New York City — the fact that in this country everybody can contribute, everybody can participate no matter who they are or what they look like or whom they love — that is what makes us strong.
I believe that what is true for America is true for virtually all mature democracies. That is no accident. We can be proud of our nations without defining ourselves in opposition to some other group. We can be patriotic without demonizing someone else. We can cherish our own identities — our religion, our ethnicity, our traditions — without putting others down. Our systems are premised on the notion that absolute power will corrupt, but that people, ordinary people, are fundamentally good and value family and friendship, faith and the dignity of hard work. And with appropriate checks and balances, Governments can reflect that goodness. I believe that is the future we must seek together — to believe in the dignity of every individual, to believe we can bridge our differences and choose cooperation over conflict. That is not weakness; that is strength. It is a practical necessity in our interconnected world.
Our people understand this. Think of the Liberian doctor who went door to door to search for Ebola cases and to tell families what to do if they show symptoms. Think of the Iranian shopkeeper who said after the nuclear deal, “God willing, now we will be able to offer many more goods at better prices”. Think of the Americans who lowered the flag over our embassy in Havana in 1961, the year I was born, and who returned this summer to raise that flag back up. One of those men said of the Cuban people, “We could do things for them, and they could do things for us. We loved them”. For 50 years we ignored that fact. Think of the families leaving everything they have known behind, risking barren deserts and stormy waters just to find shelter, just to save their children. One Syrian refugee who was met in Hamburg with warm greetings and shelter said,
“We feel there are still some people who love other people”.
The people of our United Nations are not as different as they have been told. They can be made to fear; they can be taught to hate, but they can also respond to hope. History is littered with the failure of false prophets and fallen empires who believed that might always makes right. That will continue to be the case. We can count on it. But we are called upon to offer a different type of leadership, a leadership strong enough to recognize that nations share common interests and people share a common humanity. And, yes, there are certain ideas and principles that are universal. That is what those who shaped the United Nations 70 years ago understood. Let us carry that faith forward into the future, for it is the only way we can ensure that the future will be brighter, for my children and for everyone’s children."
70,2015,IND,"The United Nations is marking its seventieth anniversary this year, making this session of the General Assembly a historic one. I hope that this year will also be historic for the United Nations in terms of outcomes. I would like to assure the President that he will receive India’s full support in his efforts.
Seventy years ago, the foundations of the United Nations were laid at the San Francisco Conference, in a city on the west coast of this country. India was one of the signatory countries of the Charter of the United Nations, although at that time we were not independent. We obtained our independence two years later. When the United Nations was established, a rather diminutive-looking man with the powerful weapon of non-violence was writing the final act in a struggle that would become a symbol of hope for the colonized and the oppressed everywhere. I am grateful that the United Nations has proclaimed the birthday of this extraordinary man as the International Day of Non-Violence. It is a pleasing coincidence that tomorrow is 2 October, and
42/55 15-29658

that we will be celebrating his birthday then. Mahatma Gandhi said, “The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the world’s problems”. His message is most fitting in the context of the United Nations.
The seventieth year of any human being’s life is a milestone from which to look back and reflect on what one has achieved and what one has lost. Similarly, for people associated with an institution, the seventieth year provides an opportunity to analyse whether the institution has fulfilled its purpose and achieved the goals set for it at its establishment. Today we need to ask ourselves whether we have fulfilled the purpose and achieved the goals for which the United Nations was established 70 years ago. When I ask myself that question, I receive an affirmative answer for some questions and a negative one for others. For example, the United Nations has been successful in preventing a third world war, assisting decolonization and dismantling apartheid. It has been successful in combating global epidemics, reducing global hunger and promoting democracy and human rights.
Yet, when we ask ourselves whether we have been able to prevent conflicts taking place in various parts of the world, the answer is “no”. If we ask whether we were able to find permanent solutions to those conflicts, the answer is “no”. If we ask whether we were able to show the path of peace to a world which is treading the path of violence, the answer is “no”. According to those parameters, the United Nations appears to be ineffective at maintaining international peace and security, an institution that has failed to effectively address new challenges in that area.
Today, the world is ravaged by war on three continents, with the Security Council powerless or unwilling to stem the f low of blood. Traditional solutions that rely on force have only exacerbated problems. We must ask ourselves if we have the political will to craft alternatives to conflict and to pursue them with commitment and single-minded dedication. Nowhere is such a goal more important than in peacekeeping. Under the blue flag, men and women are constantly working to prevent conflict, protect civilians and sustain peace processes. With 180,000 peacekeepers deployed so far, India has been the largest contributor to international security provided by the United Nations. Even today, about 8,000 Indian military and police personnel are participating in 10 peacekeeping missions, operating in highly challenging environments.
India remains committed to continuing its support to United Nations peacekeeping operations and even to enhancing its contributions, as announced by our Prime Minister at the leaders summit on peacekeeping. Our new contributions will cover all aspects of peacekeeping: personnel, enablers and training. At the same time, no dilution of the cardinal principles of peacekeeping must occur. The fact that troop-contributing countries have no role in the formulation of mandates, which are often amended without consultation, is a matter of concern. That is a clear violation of Article 44 of the Charter of the United Nations. We also believe that peacekeeping operations cannot be a substitute for political solutions, a fact that the High-Level Independent Panel on Peace Operations underscored.
As we mark the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the more than 3,300 peacekeepers, including 161 from India, who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We stand ready to contribute to the memorial wall for United Nations peacekeepers, which was approved by the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.
The safety of our peacekeepers, the security of our nations, and indeed the future of the international community itself now depend on how we respond to the greatest threat that we face today: terrorism. It is a threat that India has lived with for more than a quarter of a century, and one that was tragically brought home to this very city in the autumn of 2001. Since then, we have not adequately countered the proliferation of terrorist acts, the rise of extremist ideologies and the impunity of States that back terrorism.
Only organized international action can defeat international terrorism. The world must demonstrate zero tolerance for terrorists who kill and maim innocent civilians and base its action on the principle of prosecute or extradite. The international community must make countries that provide financing to terrorists and safe havens for their training, arming and operations pay a heavy price.
Equally important, the establishment of an international legal regime, under a comprehensive convention on international terrorism, can no longer be held up. Nineteen years ago, in 1996, India proposed such a regime at the United Nations, but the Member States have been unable to adopt it and have become mired in the issue of definition. We have to understand that no such distinction exists as good terrorists and bad terrorists, and that terrorism cannot be linked
15-29658 43/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
to any religion. A terrorist is a terrorist, and anyone who commits crimes against humanity cannot have a religion. Therefore, I appeal to everyone to come together during this seventieth anniversary year of the United Nations and to pledge to unanimously adopt a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.
While on the subject of terrorism, I take this opportunity to share the challenges that we face in our ties with Pakistan. None of us can accept that terrorism is a legitimate instrument of statecraft. The world shared our outrage at the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which citizens of many nations were helplessly butchered. That the mastermind behind the attack is walking free is an affront to the entire international community. Not only have past assurances in this regard not been honoured, but new cross-border terrorist attacks have taken place recently, and two terrorists from across the border have been captured alive. We all know that these attacks are meant to destabilize India and legitimize Pakistan’s illegal occupation of parts of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir and its claim to the rest of it.
Let me use this occasion to spell out our approach clearly. India remains open to dialogue but finds talks and terrorism to be incompatible. Yesterday, the Prime Minister of Pakistan proposed what he termed a new four-point peace initiative. I would like to respond to this. We do not need four points. We need just one — give up terrorism and let us sit down and talk. This will solve all the problems. That was precisely what was discussed and decided by the two Prime Ministers in Ufa this July. Let us hold talks, at the level of national security advisers, on all issues connected to terrorism and arrange an early meeting of our Directors-General of Military Operations to address the situation on the border. If the response is serious and credible, India is prepared to address all outstanding issues through bilateral dialogue. Even as we counter the menace of terrorism, we must acknowledge that real social and economic progress remains a critical goal. The elimination of basic human want leads almost invariably to more peaceful societies, as is evidenced by a map of the conflicts that engulf parts of the world.
Just a few days ago, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), with the Sustainable Development Goals at its core. They constitute a blueprint that is more comprehensive and holistic than the Millennium Development Goals. However, their successful implementation will require political resolve and an inclination to
share both technology and financial resources, while simultaneously improving our delivery mechanisms. As a woman and an elected Member of Parliament, it has been my firm conviction that there is a shortcut to real social change, and that is empowering the girl child. Our Government’s policy and our Prime Minister’s programme of Educate the Girl Child to Empower Her was conceived with that vision.
Our future rests on our building a sustainable planet for our children and our children’s children. As we prepare to meet in two months’ time, in Paris, the world expects us to deliver an ambitious and credible agreement on climate change. We have a duty to take common action, but in doing so we must keep in mind the larger historical contributions of some and the differentiated responsibilities of others. If Mahatma Gandhi were among us today, he would ask if we have used the resources of the planet for our needs or for our greed. He would also ask if adapting our lifestyle choices and reducing extravagant consumption would help us to correct our course. For this reason, the agreement in Paris needs to be comprehensive and equitable, while delivering concrete action. Developing countries can do more if they are enabled in their efforts by support from developed countries in the areas of finance, technology transfer and capacity- building. India is and always has been a willing partner in global efforts towards this goal. We will play our due role in reaching a meaningful, equitable and effective agreement in Paris.
India’s reverence for the environment is based on our traditions, which have always held nature as sacred. The health of the planet is tied to our own well-being, and it is this holistic approach that guided us in our call for the First International Day of Yoga, which was celebrated with much fervour in 192 countries of the world, as well as in this hallowed institution. I thank the international community for its enthusiasm and support in this regard. I hope that the seed that has been planted will grow into a magnificent tree.
I also congratulate States for their prompt action in tackling the threat of global epidemics. By linking our efforts, we have managed to eradicate smallpox and nearly eradicate polio. HIV/AIDS has been controlled and, more recently, the Ebola outbreak was contained, although not before an unacceptably high price in lives had been paid. The Ebola epidemic is an important example of how national action and international support can resolve a global crisis. We are proud that
44/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
India played its due part in these efforts. Inspired by our successes, we must redouble our efforts to eradicate other diseases, whether it be tuberculosis or malaria.
Natural disasters and man-made conflicts also deserve our coordinated response. In recent months, the international community has been found wanting in its response to the refugee crisis caused by the conflict situations in Syria, Iraq and Libya. What is needed is a swift response backed by political will. Our own response to humanitarian crises in our neighbourhood has been quick, responsive and holistic. Whether in Nepal or Yemen, India has emerged as a net security provider, assisting not only our nationals but those of other countries that sought our help. India will be hosting the first Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in November 2016, when the topic will be the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
Like the United Nations, India has walked a long way these past 70 years. As 1.25 billion of my countrymen would attest, we have done so happy in the knowledge that our democratic traditions are deeply embedded. Nonetheless, every once in a while, there is a need for transformative change — one that can reinvigorate the nation and redeem its spirit. Ever since the new Government of Prime Minister Modi took office a year and a half ago, we have committed ourselves to this renewal. It is one that has enabled India to play its rightful role in international affairs, while also becoming the fastest-growing major economy in the world. The driving force of this comprehensive renewal has been premised on the motto of sabka saath, sabka vikas, which places emphasis on the welfare of all our people.
At the same time, we have started to reach out enthusiastically to all our partners in the international community. Our efforts have focused, first and foremost, on our immediate neighbourhood and the results have been truly transformational. We have also reached out to our extended neighbourhood, renewing ancient linkages and constructing modern economic partnerships, including, most recently, a summit with 14 Pacific island nations. Our Act East policy has replaced the previous one, Look East, with a more vigorous and proactive engagement in an economically vibrant region, and complements our Link West engagement.
We remain committed to the Middle East peace process, which is key to preventing further radicalization of the region. We continue to hope that a
solution can be reached to the Palestinian question. We have also qualitatively upgraded our relations with all the major Powers.
Africa is a region with which we have historical bonds, a solidarity born out of a common struggle against colonialism and a belief in a future of shared prosperity. Later this month we will host the third India- Africa Forum Summit, the first time that the leaders of all 54 African countries have been invited.
As a nuclear-weapon State, India is aware of its responsibility, and its support for global, non-discriminatory and verifiable nuclear disarmament is undiminished.
As with nations, so it is with institutions. Only periodic renewal can provide an organization with meaning and purpose. In a world that continues to be dominated by wealthy and influential nations, the United Nations notion of sovereign equality has permitted the developing world to question some unfair norms. But it has not permitted a fundamental challenge to the inequity of a system built for a world that longer exists. If we are to preserve the centrality and legitimacy of the United Nations as the custodian of global peace, security and development, the most urgent and pressing need is reform of the Security Council. This is the need of the hour. How can we have a Security Council in 2015 that still reflects the geopolitical architecture of 1945? How can we have a Security Council that still does not give Africa and Latin America seats as permanent members?
We must include more developing nations in the decision-making structures of the Security Council. And we must change the way it does business by doing away with outdated and non-transparent working methods. Giving it more legitimacy and balance would restore its credibility and equip it to confront the challenges of our times. We are happy that during the past year, under the leadership of Their Excellences Mr. Sam Kutesa and Mr. Courtenay Rattray, we have achieved what we had been unable to do in two decades of discussions — a text for negotiations unanimously adopted by the General Assembly as decision 69/560. That first but critical step must be a springboard for action at this historic seventieth session.
For an organization such as the United Nations, 70 years has a unique significance. It is an occasion for revitalization and for renewal. I invite everyone in this Hall to contemplate the idea of the United Nations as
15-29658 45/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
a banyan tree. In the eastern tradition, the banyan tree connotes wisdom, and yet is non-judgemental and all- encompassing. It has not one trunk but many, growing outwards, each connected to the others as well as to the sky and the earth. Its expansive branches provide shade and relief, and its base has always been a place for discussion and debate.
At 70, unlike the men and women who might have planted its seed, the banyan is still young. But without constant regeneration and expansion, it withers away. That could be the fate that awaits the United Nations. Either we can take this historic opportunity to renew this critical institution or we can condemn it to irrelevance and tragic withering. We could easily lose ourselves in a labyrinth of our own creation, but if we seize the day, we will see a United Nations growing to its full potential, a United Nations that can reduce the gap between what it does and what it is capable of doing, a mighty banyan tree providing the canopy for a peaceful and prosperous humankind. I end my statement with the hope that the United Nations will grow into such a banyan tree.
"
70,2015,ZWE,"Allow me at the outset to extend to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft my warm congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. He assumes this office at an historic moment when the United Nations has just adopted an ambitious agenda for the future of humankind. The task ahead needs all hands on deck and he can count on our cooperation and support during his presidency.
I wish to commend Mr. Sam Kutesa, a distinguished son of Africa, for the dynamism with which he steered this body over the past year. We particularly appreciated his leadership in promoting inclusive dialogue and seeking consensus on the many sensitive issues that he presided over during his tenure of office.
The theme of this session — “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights” — aptly complements the deliberations of the Summit meeting on the post-2015 development agenda. It is our expectation that the United Nations will draw from its seven decades of experiences to give birth to a new era of peace, equality and justice, a new era that recognizes and fosters the commonality of our common fate through renewed international cooperation and solidarity. The African Union welcomes the priorities the President has proposed, for they go in tandem with our own development plan, the Agenda 2063, which recognizes the intrinsic and inextricable linkages between peace, security, development and the full realization of human rights.
The African Union Constitutive Act recognizes that while peace and security are imperative for our progress, conflict is a major impediment to the socio- economic advancement and integration of the continent. Consequently, the Common African Position on the post-2015 development agenda designates peace and security as one of its six key pillars. It is a top priority for us.
The prevalence of peace not only creates conditions conducive to development, but also ensures that the maximum possible resources can be dedicated to development programmes and projects. We welcome and encourage the continued cooperation between the
United Nations and the African Union, principally through the latter’s Peace and Security Council, in advancing peace and security in Africa.
In January, the leaders of the African Union adopted Agenda 2063 as our continent’s plan to accelerate deepened economic integration of our countries and regions. Its main objective is to improve the well- being of the continent’s citizenry through sustained and balanced economic growth. At the African Union Summit in Pretoria, South Africa, in June this year we agreed on the Agenda’s first 10-year development plan.
During these initial 10 years, the flagship programmes will include the creation of a continental free-trade area, an African centre for disease control, a pan-Africa university of science and technology to develop skills for the value addition and beneficiation of the continent’s vast mineral resources, a single aviation market, a high-speed train, and a pan-African e-network.
The successful implementation of Agenda 2063 calls not just for the commitment of African stakeholders but also for the support and engagement of partners beyond the borders of our continent. Africa is not looking for handouts. Rather it is looking for partners in massive infrastructure development, in creating and exploiting the value chains from its God-given natural resources, and in improving the quality of life of the continent’s citizens. The entire world stands to benefit more from an economically empowered African continent than from one emasculated by deprivation and with an over- dependence on others.
Adaptation to change is the most crucial ingredient for the vibrancy and effectiveness of any organization, including the United Nations. While the world has drastically changed since 1945, the United Nations, and indeed the global governance architecture, remains mired in a long bygone era. This archaic hierarchy among nations threatens to erode the confidence and support that the United Nations commands among the majority, but disadvantaged, of its membership. We are disappointed that we have lost the opportunity of this anniversary to address this burning issue of Security Council reform in a manner that satisfies the just demands and expectations of the majority among us.
I wish to reiterate our strong attachment to Africa’s common position on Security Council reform contained in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. I call on all genuine friends of Africa and all those
who value justice, fairness and democracy to support Africa’s just and reasonable proposals.
We equally call for the revitalization of the General Assembly, the sole universally representative and democratic organ of the United Nations, so that it can effectively carry out its Charter-mandated responsibilities. Accordingly, we fully support the call for inclusivity and transparency in selecting our Organization’s Secretary-General by ensuring that the General Assembly plays a more significant role in that process. After all, the Secretary-General is at the service of all the Member States, and not only that of an exclusive, privileged few.
Respecting and upholding human rights is the obligation of all States and is enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Nowhere does the Charter arrogate the right to some to sit in judgement over others in carrying out this universal obligation. In that regard, we reject the politicization of this important issue and the application of double standards to victimize those who dare think and act independently of the self-anointed prefects of our time. We equally reject attempts to prescribe new rights that are contrary to our values, norms, traditions and beliefs. We are not gays. Cooperation and respect for each other will advance the cause of human rights worldwide; confrontation, vilification and double standards will not.
Self-determination and independence are intrinsic and fundamental rights that should be enjoyed by all peoples everywhere, without distinction. We are deeply concerned by the continued denial of this basic right to the Saharan people. We urge the United Nations to expeditiously finalize what must be done to conclude the decolonization of the Western Sahara.
In the Middle East, the suffering of the Palestinian people continues unabated. What does Mr. Obama say about that? We reiterate our unwavering support for the just cause of the Palestinian people. Do we agree, Mr. United States? We also reiterate that lasting peace in the Middle East can be achieved only through negotiations to achieve a two-State solution based on the pre-1967 borders. We are concerned at the increase in tensions in that region and urge the United Nations to assume its responsibility and bring an end to this senseless conflict.
The promotion of gender equality is critical for the realization of the post-2015 development agenda. The African Union has designated 2015 as the Year
of Women’s Empowerment and Development towards Agenda 2063 in order to mobilize our individual and collective actions around this key issue. Gender equality and women’s empowerment are central to the achievement of human development, progress and the elimination of the scourge of poverty and deprivation. We must continue to build upon the achievements that have been realized since the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.
The growing list of phenomena that neither respect nor know any borders makes it imperative that we mobilize all mechanisms for cooperation to effectively overcome them. Terrorism and extremist violence, communicable diseases such as HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, bird flu, and Ebola cannot be overcome single-handedly. The United Nations and its specialized agencies are the place and the mechanism for this indispensable and necessary cooperation.
For some months now, we have watched heartbreaking and harrowing scenes of desperate refugees seeking to enter Europe in search of safety and shelter from the ravages of conflict in their own homelands. We have also read of the tragedy and loss of life in the Mediterranean. The majority of the affected people are from Syria or from other countries devastated by conflict and instability, induced in great part by the destabilizing policies of external forces.
This tragic situation could have been avoided through respect for the independence of other countries and non-interference in their internal affairs. In the case of Libya, we are witnessing the results of abusing the authority of the Security Council and ignoring the opinion of regional organizations, in this instance the African Union, that are supposed to be the partners of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security.
My country, Zimbabwe, is committed to a fair, just and effective United Nations in which multilateralism, inclusivity and transparency replace unilateralism, exclusion and back-room deals. The Charter of the United Nations is built on the bedrock of the sovereign equality and independence of its Members, without distinction as to their geographical size, economic might or any other endowments or qualifications. We are deeply attached to these principles and call on other Members of the United Nations to be similarly disposed. The United Nations was set up, among other purposes, to
 “develop friendly relations among nations”. Zimbabwe desires and is committed to nurturing friendly relations with other nations, but it cannot tolerate interference in its domestic affairs.
We invite other countries with which we may have differences of whatever nature — including the United States and the NATO Powers — to eschew threats, pressures and punitive actions in favour of reconciliation, friendship and dialogue. I therefore denounce in the strongest terms the illegal sanctions that are imposed on my country by the European Union and the United States of America and call for their immediate and unconditional removal. We do not know what wrong we have done to the United States. I would kindly ask it to leave us free and independent to do our own thing. Once more, I put on record that my country is desirous to live in harmony with all countries big and small. We have peace in Zimbabwe just now. We do not want war. We do not want interference. We do not want to hear of regime change at all.
The seventieth anniversary of our Organization has been marked by the adoption of a far-reaching Agenda that has the potential to drastically transform our world in all aspects. We are under no illusion about the challenges that lie ahead, but we are not discouraged, either. Humankind has, over the epochs, demonstrated an immense tenacity in overcoming inertia and resistance to change. Now is our time to leave our own positive mark on the history of human development and interaction. Posterity expects no less from us."
70,2015,HUN,"I am pleased to be addressing the General Assembly on the occasion of this seventieth anniversary.
Seventy years ago, the United Nations was founded to promote cooperation among its Member States and
4/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
to establish international peace and security. That would be a good reason to celebrate, but here we are, 70 years later, and if we are frank with one another —and we should be — it is obvious that there are no major reasons to be satisfied or to celebrate. That is because, on the seventieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations, it is not an exaggeration to say that in the years since the end of Second World War, Europe, where I come from, has not had to face at any one time challenges as numerous and as serious as those that it is facing now. And if we are talking about the world as the whole, putting things in a global context, we can say that since the end of the Cold War, the world has not had to face as many simultaneous difficulties as it is facing now.
Over the past five years, we have seen 15 wars and armed conflicts launched or renewed. And now Europe is facing a war as well. A couple of years ago, we would not have thought that Europe would have to face a war again in the twenty-first century, but now that has happened. There is a war going on in Ukraine, in our neighbourhood; and if we look at the eastern region of Europe, we see a series of frozen conflicts and territorial disputes. The European Union runs a programme called the Eastern Partnership, through which we promote cooperation with six former Soviet republics that would like to have some type of European perspective. But Belarus is the only country of the six that is not involved in some kind of territorial dispute or frozen conflict.
And Europe still faces economic challenges. I do not want to discuss that in detail, since another entire general debate would not be enough to lay out all the economic and trade challenges that we have been dealing with, but what I can say is that Europe, whose share of the world’s population is between 7 and 8 per cent, produces 15 to 16 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product and at the same time contributes 50 per cent of the world’s spending on social welfare. One does not have to be an economist to see that that is an unsustainable situation.
Currently, however, the European Union is confronting the most complicated challenge that it has seen since its foundation, namely, mass migration. Unfortunately, we have not been able to find the right answers — yet. That is because we have no consensus in Europe, or worldwide either, about the nature, size and volume of this mass migration.
In that regard, I should underline that what we are facing is not a refugee crisis. It is much greater and more complicated than that. We are situated on the most travelled migration route, and I have to say that this mass migration is composed of asylum seekers, economic migrants and also, unfortunately, some foreign fighters.
As far as its size is concerned, this mass migration has an unlimited supply of people, and if we cannot stop the influx soon, the problem will stay with us for a long time. I totally agree with the statement made by the Secretary-General at the start of the general debate to the effect that there have never been so many people on the move as there are right now (see A/70/PV.13). There are 60 million people all over the world who have had to leave their homes because of armed conflicts or wars, and in 2014 we saw the biggest increase of all in the numbers of migrants and refugees. There have not been this many refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs) at one time since the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was established.
There are two reasons for that. One is that there has been a series of bad international political decisions, in which Europe was not the only participant. The other is that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) has been gaining additional territory. If we are honest with one another, we have had only limited success so far in fighting ISIS. Owing to those two reasons, a significant part of the Middle East and North Africa has been destabilized. As a result, more than 8 million people in Iraq and more than 12.2 million in Syria now live on humanitarian aid.
In Afghanistan, after the mission of the International Security Assistance Force concluded, the international military presence there was to be reduced by 90 per cent. There are already 1 million Afghan refugees in Iran and 1.5 million in Pakistan. We have not even mentioned the struggles in Libya and the lack of a unity Government there; we have not mentioned Boko Haram or sub-Saharan Africa, where there are already more than 12.5 million IDPs.
In the meantime, we also need to focus on the fight against climate change, in which our success so far has also been limited, since the average temperature on Earth has increased by almost 1 per cent since the last century. Global warming leads to rising sea levels, which lead to extreme weather conditions, which lead
15-29946 5/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
to droughts, a lack of food, and because of that, to further migration movements. Today, there are between 25 and 30 million people who are migrants because of environmental conditions, and some forecasts say that by 2050 there could be around 100 million.
The overall picture we are seeing is one of a destabilized region in the Middle East and North Africa, with 15 new armed conflicts and wars in the past five years and limited success in combating climate change and water shortages. And it is obvious that for those three reasons, a mass global migration has begun.
“Global” is the most important word here. We have to agree that this is a global challenge. And if mass migration is a global challenge, we need a global answer, a global solution with global participation. Currently, it is Europe, or more precisely the European Union, that is bearing most of the burden of the latest waves of mass migration. I have to say that if that does not change, if we cannot regain control over our borders, if we cannot reduce the influx and the pressure, Europe could be destabilized as well, first at the periphery and then even at the centre. I would therefore like to stress again that this is a global challenge that needs a global answer, a global solution based on global participation.
What should be done? In principle, instead of addressing only the consequences, we should handle the root causes. That is the key issue. For that we have a five-point proposal. First, we have to increase our international efforts to combat ISIS. Secondly, we have to stabilize the situation in the region of North Africa and the Middle East. Thirdly, we have to create a system of world quotas for the relocation of migrants. Fourthly, we have to continue and strengthen United Nations missions. And fifthly, we have to fully implement the Sustainable Development Goals. If we are not able to comply with those five requirements, I doubt that we will be able to address the challenges entirely.
With respect to ISIS, we need to take into account that, although we have put together a very broad military coalition, we have so far achieved only limited success. ISIS is still acquiring additional territory, killing people and committing brutal crimes. We have all seen the videos. ISIS has caused more damage to our common historical heritage than all armed conflicts in the world since the end of the Second World War. So we have to increase our efforts and take coordinated action. There also needs to be close cooperation between the transatlantic community and the Russian Federation.
Hungary has already done its homework. We have deployed 112 troops in Iraqi Kurdistan. Our original mission was to act as a force protection unit but, based on a request from the United States, we are now participating in training Peshmerga troops as well. We must not forget that ISIS has committed crimes against humanity, so we urge the International Criminal Court to investigate and sanction those brutal crimes properly.
My second point was that we have to create stability in the region of the Middle East and North Africa. The major challenge there is Syria, but it is obvious that if we fail to make peace in Syria, then the migration pressure on Europe will not decrease. The only acceptable means, and maybe the only successful means, is through negotiations. There I agree with the German Chancellor, who said that we have to ensure maximum political inclusiveness. That might be the successful way to settle the conflict in Syria. That returns us to the critical point that there will be no forward progress and no possibility for resolving the crisis in Syria unless there is agreement and cooperation between the transatlantic community and the Russian Federation.
If we study the nature of mass migration, we see that migrants are usually transported by human traffickers. That is why I urge the international community to take international action to harmonize and tighten its legislation against human trafficking.
Thirdly, there should be a system of world quotas. For that reason, we ask the Secretary-General to prepare a proposal to ensure that we address the challenge globally and that all major players in global politics and economics do their part to share the burden.
My fourth point was that we have to maintain and increase the efforts of United Nations peacekeeping missions. If we are successful in peacekeeping missions and if we are capable of creating peace in unstable parts of the world, then we can hope to successfully handle the migration crisis. Hungarian troops have taken part in missions in Cyprus, Western Sahara and Lebanon. We support those missions, and we urge the United Nations to increase its efforts in that regard. However, until long-term solutions are in place, we Europeans will have to take effective short-term measures to avoid becoming unstable ourselves as a result of the heavy pressure.
Our first task in that regard is to regain control over our borders. If we cannot regain control over Europe’s borders, we will not be able to stop the influx of migrants
6/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
and we will be defenceless. It is our responsibility to establish a joint European Union force to protect the external borders of the European Union. Our second task is that we must pay tribute to all those countries, such as Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, that have been bearing enormous burdens to properly supply and treat refugees. We cannot, of course, expect them to bear that burden on their own. They are now caring for hundreds of thousands or even millions of migrants and refugees. So we propose that the European Union take over the financing of the refugee camps and, if more camps are necessary, then we must finance them. Here we would like to ask the Secretary-General to consider how the United Nations can increase its efforts to help Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon and how it can share the burden relating to migrants and refugees.
Finally, I would like to draw members’ attention to the danger of anti-Muslim policies spreading throughout Europe or even beyond. We must stress that the Muslim faith has nothing to do with the root causes of this mass migration. I come from Hungary, a Christian country, and a Christian approach does not tolerate anti-Muslim policies. We honour and respect the Muslim faith, and we would like to cooperate, as we must, in addressing the root causes of mass migration.
To summarize, mass migration is a global challenge. We must respond globally. All major players must contribute. The burden must be shared. The United Nations should play a leading role in that initiative. We are ready to work together according to the agreed Sustainable Development Goals, which call for action to ensure that migration is safe, orderly and regulated.

70,2015,MWI,"It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Mogens Lukketoft on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventieth session. His credentials are impeccable, and I am confident that he will steer the Assembly’s affairs to a successful conclusion, with all his objectives and aspirations fulfilled. I would like to assure him of my delegation’s support. I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa of our sister country Uganda, the outgoing President of the General Assembly, for his untiring efforts during his presidency. His dedication to the work of the United Nations is commendable. And I reiterate Malawi’s support for the Secretary-General as he strives to realize the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.
The theme of this year’s general debate, “The United Nations at 70 — a new commitment to action”, comes at a very opportune time, for it fittingly summarizes the core business of the United Nations at its inception, today and in the future — that is, the maintenance of international peace and security. The United Nations was created on the understanding that peace is not just the absence of war; it comes with the struggles, compromises, sacrifices and choices we make as nations and as individuals for the benefit of humanity. We cannot realize a complete sense of peace without justice, dignity and freedom. We can rejoice that in the 70 years of the work of the United Nations, we have collectively averted another world war. However, during
the same period, we have lived in fear and uncertainty, in a world tainted by the conflicts, poverty and violence that have endangered our very existence.
As we live in this imperfect world, the pursuit of peace should be our main goal if we are to shape a promising life for our future generations. I would therefore like to commend the Secretary-General for convening the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations, aimed at reviewing current United Nations operations and considering emerging future needs in the prevention and resolution of conflicts. The Panel’s report (A/70/95), submitted in June, has highlighted some important issues that I feel that we, as part of the global family, should consider and take seriously. I would like to mention just a few of those issues demanding our attention as members of the United Nations.
First, peace operations should be guided by a focus on political solutions, in which the emphasis should be on conflict prevention through political means, with a bias towards people-centred solutions as well as the protection of civilians. Secondly, there is a need for comprehensive peace and security partnerships that involve the Security Council, regional actors and national mechanisms. Thirdly, the world, through the United Nations, should find a way to compensate people who have suffered abuse. Fourthly, there is a need for greater political will on the part of all actors in peace missions.
Let me now touch on another important issue that has been on the agenda of the United Nations for quite some time, that is, reform of the Security Council. I have followed with keen interest the intergovernmental negotiations on how the Security Council can be reformed to make it more representative, democratic, effective, transparent and accountable to all. The Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration are our guiding principles in that endeavour. Our quest for peace and security should be hinged on sustainable socioeconomic development for our people that has true meaning and reflects the lives of our people.
Despite varied progress among Member States, and developing countries in particular, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have proved that unity of purpose is critical to transforming the world into a better place for our children and future generations. My Government is grateful to development partners that have worked to help Malawi achieve four of the
38/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
eight MDGs: reducing child mortality, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for development. It is evident that as a country we are embarking on the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda with unfinished business. It is therefore imperative, as we move to implement the new global development agenda, to be mindful of the important role that global partnerships can play in effective development cooperation, thereby ensuring the successful implementation of development programmes in the developing countries.
We in Malawi are also glad to reiterate the fact that, as we look to the Sustainable Development Goals, we can draw international pride and inspiration from our collective achievements on MDG 6, which involves halting and reversing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Under that goal, we aimed to put 15 million people on treatment globally, and today we can stand here and boldly declare that we have met that target. As we look to the sustainable development agenda, we must commit, as the international community, to putting an end to AIDS as a public health threat and finishing the business of HIV/AIDS by 2030.
My Government has already committed to doing so, and current evidence shows that Malawi is well on the way to achieving that goal. Together, we can end AIDS by 2030, but it will require conducting business “as unusual” and fast-tracking HIV responses, in line with the evidence of what works. But more importantly, it will require continued shared responsibility and global solidarity in financing HIV programmes and enhancing the capacity of developing countries such as Malawi to manufacture the drugs and make them more accessible to our people.
Having said that, let me also reiterate what I have always maintained — that all of the aforementioned wonderful programmes will be realized when we, as a global family, do not leave our youth and women behind. In Malawi and, I believe, in almost all developing countries, young people and women constitute the majority of the population. It is therefore only natural that they be adequately represented at all decision-making levels of society. The late President Mandela of South Africa once said, “As long as a nation refuses to acknowledge the equal role of more than half of itself, it is doomed to failure”. That is a fact and I could not agree with it more.
Let me commend President Xi Jinping of China, and the Secretary-General, through the Office of UN-Women, for organizing on the margins of this session the Global Leaders’ Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment: A Commitment to Action, under the theme “Planet 50-50 by 2030: step it up for gender equality”, to which a number of leaders, including Malawi’s, made national commitments.
My Government is committed to the “He For She” campaign to address gender inequality, end gender- based violence, promote women’s political participation and facilitate women’s economic empowerment. It has therefore been singled out as one of the core priority areas of our revised Malawi Growth and Development Strategy — the blueprint of Malawi’s development. Malawi also took advantage of the forum to host a side high-level event to share perspectives on demographic dividends and investing in youth, which we hope will successfully lead to improved coordination, commitment and support for youth empowerment and development for Africa.
We have expressed the desire for shared prosperity and well-being and unity and integration, for a continent where the full potential of women and youth are realized with freedom from fear, disease and want. As others taking the floor earlier have noted, two days ago we adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). That was brilliant. However, allow me to highlight SDG 4, which speaks of education. As a champion of higher education in Africa, I wish to reiterate in no uncertain terms that all of the brilliant resolutions and decisions coming out of this great forum, and many similar ones across the world, will fall flat if countries ignore the task of educating the people, especially young people and, even more so, girl children.
In that vein, I am pleased to note that Sustainable Development Goal 4 is about “ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning”. However, it does not fully capture the centrality of higher education in achieving the wider Sustainable Development Goals and targets. Allow me to express gratitude to those partners that continue to stand with us to promote higher education in Africa. With improved and increased access to higher education, the world will strike a massive blow at poverty.
In fulfilling its national and international responsibility, my Government recognizes the cross- cutting role of respecting and protecting people’s
15-29431 39/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
human rights and the rule of law. My Government will continue to promote human rights, inter alia, by enhancing awareness of human rights, promoting equitable access to opportunity and strengthening legal protections.
The full enjoyment of people’s human rights cannot be achieved in a society full of fraud, corruption and theft of public resources. Those vices must be dealt with in order to protect people’s human rights and ensure the delivery of expected services from their Government. Our Government has therefore always been committed to fighting corruption, fraud and theft. It is against that background that we are pursuing and prosecuting suspects for the theft of public funds. May god bless the United Nations family.
"
70,2015,BLR,"Seventy years ago, after the end of the Second World War, humankind cherished the hope that a just world order, based on mutual understanding and cooperation, might be established. However, what followed after that — the Cold War — once again split the world into opposing blocs. After the break-up of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, many thought that military conflicts and the reasons for confrontation between States would finally disappear. Alas, those hopes have not yet been realized. Unfortunately, we must admit that our world has not become more stable, predictable
or comfortable for the majority of people on the planet, despite the enormous work and tremendous efforts made to implement the large-scale plans of the United Nations.
At the Summit three days ago we adopted an ambitious agenda for the United Nations for the next 15 years in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). That outcome document focuses on five strategic areas that are vitally important for all of us, namely, people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership. Those notions did not emerge from nowhere. They are a logical continuation of the efforts made to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Nevertheless, those efforts now give rise to conflicting emotions. Yes, there have been certain shifts, including a reduction in global poverty levels, an increase in the level of protection, improvements in maternal and child health, and expanded access to education.
But despite those achievements, we have to acknowledge that we have not had a qualitative breakthrough for the good of human civilization. Moreover, we see that the world today is being engulfed by new challenges, and old problems are being exacerbated. Those challenges and problems do not concern just one area, but rather all the most important aspects of human activity.
First, today we are confronted with entirely new geopolitical realities and military conflicts. Many speakers before me have already mentioned that fact. Unprecedented tension has arisen in international relations. Threats are coming to the fore for which there are as yet no answers. Focusing on minor disputes, the global community has overlooked the emergence of aggressive global terrorist groups.
The entire system of international security is undergoing a most serious crisis. There is a loss of mutual trust between global players. There is an unwillingness to compromise. There is a return to elements of a bloc-like confrontation that have, in fact, basically put the world on the brink of a new war. There are continuing attempts to impose a particular development model on other countries. What does that lead to? As a result of foreign interference, the export of colour revolutions and artificial regime changes, countries that used to be stable have now been plunged into chaos and anarchy. All of that is covered over with the gloss of democracy. Instead of the promised democracy and prosperity, people in those countries are living through extreme suffering or have been forced to flee. Crowds of migrants are besieging Europe today. And that too has now become an acute international problem.
Today we are increasingly dependent on each other. The actions of one country have direct implications for the interests of many others. Invulnerable countries no longer exist. We must honestly acknowledge that today we do not have an effective system of checks and balances. The States that claim global leadership cannot, unfortunately, escape the temptation to use force and economic blackmail in order to promote their own interests. The world has come perilously close to a de facto renunciation of the principles of international law as they are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
That is why I am deeply convinced that the Organization badly needs a new wide-ranging discussion of the principles for the future coexistence of States and peoples. I have already mentioned that before, but I want to emphasize once again that the Organization must not become a forum for mutual recrimination and confrontation among States. There is no alternative to dialogue. We will have to deal with our problems collectively. One can of course build new walls and draw new dividing lines, but that will not make our problems disappear.
Secondly, global economic threats are a serious challenge to world stability. Currency wars, sanctions, the redivision of commodity markets, unfair competition and other negative phenomena compound the global crisis. Attempts on the part of a number of
leading States to solve their problems at the expense of other countries also add to the confrontation and the feeling of estrangement. We can get out of that deadlock only through comprehensive cooperation among the economies of all countries and through the search for the best paths to sustainable development for the benefit of the global community, not just for an individual country. At the same time, it is important to support the poor and poorest States.
It is only through common efforts that we will able to forge a new formula of universal, mutually beneficial cooperation. Belarus suggests that the idea of the integration serves as a foundation for such universal cooperation, as one of the more topical trends of the modern world. Just take a look at how many new integration groups have emerged recently. Today we talk about the prospects for cooperation between the European Union and the Eurasian Economic Union, about the large-scale Great Silk Road project, about creating the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Free Trade zones and dozens of others.
If we succeed in avoiding unnecessary and dangerous competition among integration models, and instead make them compatible with and complementary to each other, ideally we will establish a global integration structure that would cover our entire planet and closely link the various regions and whole continents. Such a paradigm could provide for the peaceful coexistence of the various nations and States, united by the common purpose of progress and prosperity. The value of the integration process lies in its democratic nature. To a certain extent, it equalizes the opportunities for all stakeholders and enables both small and middle-sized countries to develop their potential and become an important link in that process.
The key prerequisite for integration is mutual benefit. However, the desire to reap immediate unilateral advantages is the root of evil. We need to realize our responsibility for the future and think of what we will leave behind. We must not forget that extreme poverty in some regions of our planet, outrageous social inequalities within societies, disproportion among States and the lack of opportunities, above all among young people, create fertile ground for international terrorism and organized crime.
The social, humanitarian and ecological spheres comprise a third cluster of global threats. Of late, we have been hearing resounding calls from several countries for maximum freedom. Such calls put the
basic foundations of human society, including such concepts as family, morals and virtue, to the test. Irresponsible social ideas may lead to new divisions among the various cultures and give birth to harsh religious rejection in ethnic conflicts. Have those social innovators considered the consequences of their words and actions, I wonder?
The same selfish attitude is characteristic of humankind’s approach to nature. For many years now, the international community has been trying, with no success, to meet the challenges of climate change. Many simply prefer to shift the burden of responsibility onto others, onto the next generation.
Thinking about such problems, one cannot help arriving at a certain idea. It seems there is one deep- rooted source of those crises and challenges. It is an artificial cult of individual rights and human freedoms at the expense of collective social interests. Under the guise of protecting human rights, advocates of such ideas seek to justify the ousting and overthrow of Governments, the destruction of States and wars over resources. Chaos and anarchy are proliferating. A predatory attitude towards nature and the pursuit of easy profits are being fostered. That leads to the degradation of human consciousness, in which someone’s perverted whims are treated as the norm. Such approaches give a green light to social degradation and the decay of moral principles and human values. The very boundary between good and evil disappears.
Belarus does not claim to have ready-made recipes for resolving those issues, but we sincerely believe that the answer lies in the realm of those ideas that were proposed to the world 70 years ago by the founders of the United Nations. First and foremost, I refer here to the unconditional condemnation of violence. Wars must not be an instrument for settling scores between States. “Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding,” said the wise Einstein. It is hard to argue with that. It is only through self-restraint that we can ensure the well-being and protection of everyone, the powerful and the vulnerable alike. That is precisely the essence of international law, which is the only alternative to the law of the jungle.
Belarus will always support any and all efforts and initiatives aimed at strengthening the system of international law. That is our key foreign-policy priority. However, international law alone cannot safeguard peace and security globally. What is also
needed is to create decent conditions of life for every single individual at the national level. I am deeply convinced that only a strong State can adequately cope with such a task. It is paradoxical that humankind has entered the twenty-first century with a large number of failed and ineffective States. What is a failed State? It is basically one characterized by the absence of the rule of law and stability and by glaring inequality and extreme poverty, the lack of motivation and the absence of healthy moral values among the young.
We in Belarus understand that very well. Over the past two decades, we have been purposefully building a sovereign State with a socially oriented economy. We have paid and are continuing to pay the utmost attention to policies that strengthen the family and help young people fully realize their potential. Let me be frank: we are very concerned by the ongoing destruction of traditional family values that is taking place in several countries. We particularly do not like being invited to accept certain moral deviations and various social innovations as natural. I will not to dwell on that problem too much. I am afraid that I will get bogged down here and will be criticized, but I feel compelled to ask the following: who will give birth to children? We will do everything to ensure that our grandchildren and their descendants preserve socially nurtured moral values and good traditions of spirituality and culture.
I can assure everyone here with absolute confidence that anarchy, lawlessness and violence will never find a place on the soil of Belarus, no matter what guise they take, including democracy. We are sufficiently strong and self-assured not to let them in from the outside. As before, a stable Belarus will continue to remain a provider of regional and international security.
We intend to build equal, mutually beneficial and respectful relations with all countries around the world. Good neighbourliness and mutual assistance are of special value to us. That is why today we strive for a peaceful settlement of the crisis in brotherly Ukraine, as well as in other hotspots on the planet. Belarus will continue to be actively engaged in collective efforts to meet global threats and challenges, first and foremost within international organizations. Those organizations have invaluable experience, expertise and potential. Belarus can offer the international community its experience, although limited, in tackling a number of problems — for example, the Chernobyl disaster and the elimination of its consequences, and dealing with the issue of trafficking in people.
Thinking about our national developmental experience, I can reach the following conclusions. Only an alliance of strong, responsible and effective States, united by the system of international law, can adequately respond to modern global threats and challenges. For that, the role of the United Nations is crucial.
These days we hear a lot of criticism about the United Nations. Of course, the Republic of Belarus shares the key idea that the Organization cannot remain static, it should keep abreast of the times. For us, there is an obvious need to reform the structures and activities of the United Nations while maintaining the inviolability of the purposes and principles of its Charter. It is also important to understand that the United Nations, as I have said on many occasions, is all of us together. The well-being of the world community will depend on how coordinated and constructive we are.
Far be it from me to want to sound prophetic, once again, on the second day of our work, but today one cannot help feel that we are witnessing the spectre of a massive new war. We must not allow that sinister vision to turn into a reality.
Yesterday we discussed very important issues and the agenda for the future of the United Nations. But when we talk of sustainable development, that may well sound like sacrilege to millions of people, both old and young, because they are dying. What we must do is come together and adopt one decision, and one decision only, namely, to put an end to all wars and conflicts that have erupted and are currently ravaging our planet.
In conclusion, I would like to quote another eminent person, Nelson Mandela. That unbroken fighter for justice in the world once said, “Sometimes it falls on a generation to be great. You can be that generation.” I hope very much that such a destiny will indeed befall our generation. I am confident that we will find the strength and common sense to do whatever it takes to change the world for the better. That is the only option we have."
70,2015,MUS,"Twelve years ago, I bade farewell to the Assembly, as I had decided to retire from active politics thereafter, which I did. However, destiny and the wish of the people of Mauritius brought me back into the political arena, and I stand here anew as Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius, following my electoral victory in December 2014 through free and fair elections.
This is yet another affirmation of the fact that Mauritius upholds a high tradition of democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law and peaceful coexistence. We will solemnly continue to uphold those universal values, which require our careful nurturing as States Members of the United Nations. For indeed, there can be no better tribute to the United Nations, as we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the Charter, than to see nations working together to sustain those values and to promote the establishment of peace and security.
In that context, we commend the Secretary-General for the timely setting up of the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations to review the United Nations peace architecture. We are particularly supportive of the recommendation for stronger and deeper partnerships among global and regional organizations aimed at promoting international peace and security. For we in Mauritius have witnessed how the collective efforts of the United Nations, the African Union, the Southern African Development Community, the Indian Ocean Commission and other regional economic communities unlocked the political stalemate in Madagascar, enabling our neighbour and brother nation to pursue its path to development. Similar collaboration has also enabled the African Union to deploy robust operations in complex situations in Mali, the Central African Republic and Somalia.
Mauritius strongly condemns the recent coup in Burkina Faso and appreciates the current initiatives of the United Nations, the African Union and Economic Community of West African States to keep that country on the path of democracy. Mauritius is fully committed to the implementation of Agenda 2063 of the African Union, which represents the collective vision of Africans for a peaceful, united and prosperous Africa.
We congratulate the Palestinian Authority on the occasion of the formal recognition by the United
15-29816 13/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
Nations of Palestine as an Observer. Mauritius calls on the international community to put in even greater efforts to ensure that the two independent, secure and viable States of Palestine and Israel live peacefully side by side. Similarly, we wish to see an end to the phenomenon of refugees fleeing one tragedy only to face an even greater disaster.
The spread of armaments, nuclear proliferation, terrorism and piracy remain important threats to world peace and require our constant vigilance. My country will therefore pursue its fight against piracy as a member of the Contact Group on Somali Piracy and welcomes the decision to review the boundaries of the High Risk Area, so as to reduce inflationary pressures on maritime and freight costs. We welcome the agreement reached on the Iranian nuclear issue and call for the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as it can contribute to international peace and security.
Let me share with the Assembly the fact that Mauritius acceded to the Arms Trade Treaty in July, and yesterday I deposited our instrument of accession to the Convention on Cluster Munitions. As we deal with the issue of armaments, we must remain conscious of the fact that the biggest weapon of all remains fear — the fear that terrorists use so extensively to curtail freedom of thought, freedom of expression and impose their intolerance upon those who dare to be different. Mauritius unreservedly condemns terrorism, in all its forms and remains committed to combating intolerance and extremism, whether at the domestic level or internationally.
As we focus on peace and security, let us continue to let ourselves be inspired by the life and deeds of Mahatma Gandhi, whose birth date we are commemorating today. We have another golden opportunity here to pay tribute to the Mahatma, the apostle of nonviolence, the man who shunned intolerance and who asked us to live simply so that others may simply live.
As a small island developing State (SIDS) that is vulnerable to natural hazards, Mauritius believes that the greatest challenge to peace and security in the years to come will be climate change, which requires our utmost attention now. If we do not act collectively and in a spirit of solidarity, if we are unable to reach a binding climate agreement at the coming United Nations Climate Change Conference that would limit the world temperature increase to less than 1.5°C compared to
1990, we will be failing in our duty towards Mother Earth and future generations.
Let there be a space carved out for small island developing States, the most vulnerable of all, for the least developed countries (LDCs) and for Africa to enable them to implement fully the necessary mitigation and adaptation measures. Let financing be available and predictable, in addition to the sharing of technology to address a collective threat. In this respect, Mauritius is pleased to host the Commonwealth Climate Finance Skills Hub, which will be launched at the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta. This mechanism aims to assist SIDS and LDCs access much-needed funds for adaptation and mitigation.
Mauritius particularly welcomes Sustainable Development Goal 5, relating to women’s and girls’ empowerment. Mauritius has made steady progress on this agenda and continues to put in place appropriate strategies to further promote gender equality in all spheres of development. I am proud to announce that for the first time in history, my country has three women in high positions: President of the Republic, Vice-President, and Speaker of the National Assembly of Mauritius.
There can be no democracy without human rights and no human rights without development. A balance needs to be maintained in the trident of peace, human rights and development.
We are living at a time of uncertainty when not a single nation is immune from external shocks, but some are more exposed than others.
As a small developing State, my country is highly vulnerable to external shocks and a high current account deficit. We depend on foreign markets for tourism, trade and investments, and we have limited fiscal space to manoeuvre. In addition, our ageing population not only leads to a reduction of our productive capacity, but also costs significant resources in terms of health care financing and retirement benefits. However, against this bleak backdrop, my Government is making sure that the welfare State, of which we are so proud, is maintained. We are re-engineering our economy. We have pledged to achieve an average gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.5 per cent annually as from 2017 on the back of a technology- and innovation-driven economy focusing on sustainability and human development.

More than ever, Mauritius needs the support of the international community to untangle itself from the middle-income web and reach the high-income country status. Financial institutions and development partners need to look beyond our relatively high GDP, which obscures the real cost that we have to pay for our development and precludes us from accessing vital development finance and support. Development partners should not forget that the specific and unique vulnerabilities of SIDS have been reiterated, highlighted and acknowledged by world leaders in the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway and now in the post-2015 agenda.
It is gratifying to note that the Addis Ababa International Conference on Financing for Development has pledged to support the economic transformation of SIDS and LDCs through domestic resource mobilization, catalytic use of official development assistance and strong trade commitments. These promises should be effectively translated into reality to drive forward our sustainable development agenda.
Mauritius is committed to upholding good governance, transparency and the rule of law at all levels. We have been very active in ensuring effective implementation of international standards of transparency and exchange of information, with a view to combating tax evasion, money laundering and other malpractices. Mauritius was one of the earliest States to sign a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to automatically exchange information on financial matters, and in June we reaffirmed our commitment by officially signing the OECD’s multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.
In March this year, Mauritius was privileged to host the signature ceremony for the United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor- State Arbitration (resolution 69/116, annex), otherwise known as the Mauritius Convention on Transparency. By being the first country to sign and ratify the Convention, we are forcefully demonstrating our commitment to democratic participation, transparency and good governance.
The rule of law should be promoted not only at the national, but also at the international, level. We need to pursue meaningful efforts to reform the United Nations to make it more responsive to the needs and aspirations of all the Member States. If our Organization is to
remain legitimate, there should be a comprehensive reform of the Security Council. The status quo is not an option. The legitimate aspiration of Africa for permanent representation in the Council should not be denied. Mauritius reaffirms its commitment to the African Common Position, enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. Small island developing States, which represent over a quarter of United Nations membership, deserve representation on the Council. Likewise, Mauritius supports India’s rightful aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed Security Council.
Mauritius has always firmly supported the resolution of disputes by peaceful means, as inscribed in the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that, in accordance with resolutions of the Assembly, it is high time to complete the process of decolonization in Africa.
It is also high time to resolve the situation that prevents Mauritius from effectively exercising its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago and the island of Tromelin, which form an integral part of the territory of Mauritius. The Chagos Archipelago was illegally excised by the United Kingdom from the territory of Mauritius prior to its accession to independence, in breach of international law and resolutions of the Assembly. In the wake of that illegal excision, the Mauritians who were residing at the time in the Chagos Archipelago were forcibly evicted by the British authorities, in total disregard of their human rights. Most of them were moved to the main island of Mauritius. The Government of Mauritius is fully sensitive to their plight and to their legitimate aspiration, as Mauritian citizens, to resettle in the Archipelago.
Mauritius welcomes the Award of the Arbitral Tribunal delivered on 18 March against the United Kingdom, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We welcome the Tribunal’s decision that the Marine Protected Area purportedly declared by the United Kingdom around the Chagos Archipelago was established in violation of international law. We also welcome the Tribunal’s unanimous recognition that Mauritius has an interest in significant decisions bearing upon the uses of the Archipelago pending its return to the effective control of Mauritius.
This arbitral proceeding was the first occasion on which any international judge or arbitrator has considered the facts and history lying behind Mauritius’ entitlement to sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago.
15-29816 15/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
Mauritius appreciates the fact that two arbitrators have confirmed the opinion that the United Kingdom is not the coastal State in relation to the Chagos Archipelago. That view has not been contradicted by any other judge or arbitrator. It unquestionably confirms our stand that the Chagos Archipelago is and always has been an integral part of the territory of Mauritius.
The Tribunal underscores the United Kingdom’s legally binding obligations to Mauritius. It establishes beyond doubt that under international law Mauritius has real, firm and binding rights over the Chagos Archipelago and that the United Kingdom must respect those rights. The Tribunal recognized that Mauritius has a legal interest in the Chagos Archipelago such that decisions affecting its future use cannot be taken without the involvement of Mauritius.
Despite the Tribunal’s clear ruling, we regret that the United Kingdom appears to be adopting a different approach to Mauritius’s rights. It recently launched a so-called consultation exercise on the potential resettlement of Mauritians of Chagossian origin in the Chagos Archipelago under conditions that again amount to a gross violation of their most basic human rights. Mauritius rejects this purported consultation exercise unreservedly. We wish to assure the international community that once Mauritius is able to effectively exercise its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, our brothers and sisters of Chagossian origin who resettle there will be able to live in dignity and enjoy their basic human rights, as they currently do in Mauritius.
Considering the Tribunal’s decision, we urge the United States of America, which is currently using Diego Garcia for defence purposes, to engage in discussions with Mauritius regarding the long-term interests of Mauritius where the Chagos Archipelago is concerned, particularly in view of the affirmation by the President of the United States when he said so earnestly in his address to the Assembly on Monday that “we cannot stand by when the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation is flagrantly violated” (A/70/PV.13, p. 12).
The Government of Mauritius is resolutely committed to making every effort that accords with international law to enable it to effectively exercise its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, including the possibility of having further recourse to judicial or arbitral bodies. We urge the Assembly and the international community in general to support
Mauritius in its legitimate endeavours. The Assembly has a direct institutional interest in the resolution of the matter.
The Assembly has of course historically played a central role in addressing decolonization through the exercise of its powers and functions, especially in relation to Chapters XI through XIII of the Charter of the United Nations. In its resolution 1514 (XV), of 14 December 1960, on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, the Assembly declared that any attempt to disrupt the territorial integrity of such a country was incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter. In resolution 2066 (XX), of 16 December 1965, which dealt specifically with Mauritius, the Assembly drew attention to the duty of the administering Power not to dismember the territory or violate the territorial integrity of the then colony.
The Assembly therefore has a responsibility to help to complete the historic process of decolonization that it so successfully instigated and oversaw in the second half of the twentieth century. That is why we are convinced that the Assembly should now establish a mechanism to enable and monitor the full implementation of its relevant resolutions.
I would like to take this opportunity to express Mauritius’s deep appreciation for the unflinching support it has consistently received from members of the African Union, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77 and China, and other friendly countries on the issue of its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago.
As regards Tromelin, we urge France to pursue a dialogue with Mauritius in order to quickly resolve the dispute over that island in the spirit of friendship that has always characterized the relationship between our two countries.
(spoke in French)
We know we can count on France’s nobility and its ideals of justice and fraternity to ensure that Mauritius can exercise effective sovereignty over Tromelin.
I will conclude by saying that for peace, security and inclusive and sustainable development to prevail in our countries, we must act from our hearts. Only then will we succeed in building the world we all dream of. We should take inspiration from the wisdom- packed message of Pope Francis, who blessed us with

his presence in the Assembly last week. As he said so magnanimously:
“It must never be forgotten that political and economic activity is only effective when it is understood as a prudential activity, guided by a perennial concept of justice and constantly conscious of the fact that, above and beyond our plans and programmes, we are dealing with real men and women, just like the Government leaders, who live, struggle and suffer, and are often forced to live in great poverty, deprived of all rights.” (A/70/PV.3, p. 4)
"
70,2015,NGA,"On behalf of the Government and the people of Nigeria, I would like to congratulate the President and his country on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventieth session. May I also express appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, both of whom worked tirelessly to ensure the proper articulation of the post-2015 development agenda and to maintain the focus and commitment to the ideals of the United Nations. I also thank the Secretary-General for his recent visit to Nigeria, where we held very useful discussions.
Fifty-five years ago, almost to the day, my predecessor, Nigeria’s first Prime Minister, Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, stood in this forum to declare Nigeria’s desire to develop and maintain friendly relations with all countries. He also assured the world of our country’s commitment to upholding the principles upon which the United Nations was founded.
My country has lived by that conviction, even when, for instance, judgements went against us in territorial disputes with our neighbours. We respected those judgements and abided by them as a mark of respect for the rule of law and the Charter of the United Nations. Nigeria’s record in the service of United Nations peacekeeping operations is second to none. I myself, as a young officer in the Nigerian army, did several tours of duty in the Congo and Lebanon. Nigeria has contributed to United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Ethiopia, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Darfur. Furthermore, we are proud of our contributions to other activities of the United Nations, including the Peacebuilding Commission, the Human Rights Council and security-sector reform.
We are gratified to note that most countries have pledged their commitment to the post-2015 development agenda in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) contained therein, along with their means of implementation. That successor framework to the Millennium Development Goals has come with lofty aspirations and, if I may say so, heroic assumptions. Nonetheless, the new Goals target broad- ranging development cooperation by the international community up to the year 2030, and they deserve universal support. That is because the SDGs mirror the hopes and aspirations of much of the world.
I should stress that for the newly adopted SDGs to be truly global, they must be practical. In that regard, the Agenda’s core objectives of eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities must be met within the framework of revitalized global partnership support and concrete policies and actions, as outlined in the Addis Ababa Agenda on Financing for Development. Luckily, those two core objectives of the SDGs are precisely at the centre of the agenda of Nigeria’s new Administration.
It must be emphasized that foreign direct investment, supplemented, where suitable, by official development assistance, as outlined in the Addis Ababa Agenda, are necessary, though not sufficient, conditions for accelerated development in countries that are trying to catch up. In that connection, I would like to appeal to industrialized countries to redeem their pledges to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to development assistance. With the sole exception of the United Kingdom, all the countries concerned, so I am told, have still to meet that United Nations requirement. With the SDGs, we have the opportunity to improve the lives of people, not just in the developing world but in all nations.
The Secretary-General himself has listed six essential elements for delivering on the SDGs, namely, dignity, prosperity, justice, partnership, planet and people. As a prerequisite to those elements, and as we look at history and remember the terrible events that gave rise to the birth of the United Nations in 1945, I would like to propose a seventh essential element, namely, peace.
Peace is close to the hearts of Nigerians, as we are in the front line in the war on terror. Boko Haram’s war against the people of Nigeria, Chad, the Niger and
Cameroon may not attract as much worldwide attention as the wars in the Middle East, but the suffering is just as great and the human cost is equally high. This is a war about values between progress and chaos. It concerns democracy and the rule of law. Boko Haram celebrates violence against the weak and the innocent and, deplorably, hides behind its perverted interpretation of Islam. Boko Haram is as far from Islam as can possibly be imagined.
Many of my colleagues present in this forum want to know how our new Government intends to tackle the huge problems that we have inherited. Friends of Nigeria and foreign investor partners will be encouraged to know that the new Government is attacking the problems we inherited head-on. We intend to tackle the inequalities arising from massive unemployment and the previous Government’s policies that favoured a few people to the detriment of the many. We intend to emphasize quality technological education for development and lay a foundation for the comprehensive care of the aged, the disadvantaged and the infirm. But for now, terrorism is the immediate problem.
Accordingly, the new Nigerian Government, which I have the honour to head, has moved with dispatch to implement a bold and robust strategy to defeat Boko Haram. Nigeria and its neighbours — Cameroon, Chad, the Niger and Benin — are working together to face the common threat within the regional framework of the Lake Chad Basin Commission. We have established a multinational joint task force to confront, degrade and defeat Boko Haram. We have driven them away from many of their strongholds, killed or captured many of their operatives and commanders and freed several hundreds of hostages. One of our major aims is to rescue the Chibok girls alive and unharmed. We are working around the clock to ensure their safety and eventual reunion with their families. The Chibok girls are constantly on our minds and in our plans.
Terrorism is by no means the main or the only evil threatening and undermining the well-being of societies around the world. Corruption, cross-border financial crime, cybercrime, human trafficking, communicable diseases, climate change and the proliferation of weapons are all major challenges of the twenty-first century that the international community must tackle collectively. I would like to reaffirm the Nigerian Government’s unwavering commitment to fighting corruption and illicit financial flows. By any measure, corruption and cross-border financial crimes
are impediments to development, economic growth and the realization of the well-being of citizens across the globe.
Nigeria is ready and willing to partner with international agencies and individual countries on a bilateral basis to confront crime and corruption. In particular, I call upon the international community to urgently redouble its efforts to strengthen the mechanisms for dismantling safe havens for the proceeds of corruption and for ensuring the return of stolen funds and assets to their countries of origin.
The world is now facing another big new challenge, that is, human trafficking. It is an old evil that has taken on an altogether new and dangerous dimension, which threatens to upset international relationships. We in Africa are grieved to see in the international media the hundreds of thousands of our able-bodied men and women who are fleeing to Europe, with thousands dying in the process in the desert or drowning in the Mediterranean. We condemn in the strongest possible terms traffickers in human beings and will support any measures to apprehend and bring them to justice. At the same time, we greatly appreciate European Governments, particularly those of Italy and Germany, for their understanding and humane treatment of those refugees.
Last year, our continent faced the dreadful outbreak of Ebola. We sincerely thank the international community for its collective efforts to contain that deadly disease. We are not out of the woods yet, but we would like to express our appreciation to the United States, the United Kingdom, France and China, which, in collaboration with the host countries, provided outstanding assistance to stop the spread of Ebola and to care for those infected.
Nigeria fully subscribes to and endorses Goals 13, 14 and 15 of the Sustainable Development Goals with regard to climate change. In Nigeria, desertification and land erosion and degradation, which lead to biodiversity loss, are real threats to our environment and, under the auspices of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, we will propose a regional approach to combating those environmental challenges. In that connection, we look forward to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December. That Summit should give humankind hope
that the looming threat faced by many communities around the world is being addressed.
We are witnessing a dreadful increase in conflicts fuelled by the availability of small arms and light weapons. I call upon all Member States to show the political will needed to uphold the Charter of the United Nations in that regard. For a start, robust implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty will guarantee that small arms and light weapons are transferred only in a legal manner. Arms traffickers and human traffickers are two evil species that the international community needs to eradicate.
As we engage in these annual debates, we must remind ourselves of the principles that led to the founding of the United Nations years ago. Among them are the peaceful coexistence and self-determination of peoples. In that context, the unresolved question of self-determination for the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara, both nations having been adjudged by the United Nations as being entitled to that inalienable right, must now be resolved without any further delay or obstacle.
The international community has come to pin its hopes on resolving the Palestinian issue through the two-State solution, which recognizes the legitimate right of each State to exist in peace and security. The world has no more excuses or reasons to delay the implementation of the long list of Security Council resolutions on that question, nor do we have the moral right to deny any people their freedom or condemn them indefinitely to occupation and blockade.
The United Nations is 70 years old. As the world’s forum, it can count many more than 70 major achievements. It is my hope that in the next 70 years it will take control of the climate, help to eliminate communicable diseases, eliminate major and local conflicts and thereby eliminate the refugee problem, take major steps towards reducing harmful inequalities among nations and within nations and, above all, eliminate nuclear weapons."
70,2015,NRU,"It is an honour to be here for the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. I can only marvel at the scale of that accomplishment. Not only has this institution grown from its original 51 Members to its current 193, but it has also expanded its work to take on a remarkable number of issues facing the world. Our debate here provides an excellent opportunity to reflect on what has made the Organization so successful.
I believe the reason for that success can be summed up in a single word: legitimacy. Only with legitimacy can we expect leaders from around the world to gather here every September. Only with legitimacy can we expect the agreements we reach here to be implemented
in the real world. However, legitimacy is a fragile thing. It takes decades to build, but can be lost in the blink of an eye. Therefore, preserving and strengthening the legitimacy of this institution must be at the centre of our work if the United Nations is to remain a powerful force for progressive change in the world.
Therefore, to strengthen the legitimacy of the United Nations, I propose that the road ahead be guided by three principles: universality, adaptability and accountability. We took an important step in that direction last week with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which demonstrates our ability to learn from past experience and create an approach that is better tailored to the needs and circumstances of all nations.
The Agenda places the welfare of human beings at its core and lays out a comprehensive set of Goals and targets to help empower every individual to realize his or her full potential. This moves us away from looking at single indicators like gross domestic product or income per capita to measure human progress and focuses our work on building a more robust foundation for sustainability and prosperity. Education, public health, gender equality, clean water, oceans, energy and, more importantly, a strong family unit — those are some of the blocks on which our future must be built.
For my country, the ocean is the source of almost all development possibilities. Unlike large countries, we do not have a diversified portfolio of industries. Phosphate mining and fishing constitute the large bulk of economic possibilities for Nauru, along with less than a handful of other sources of income. It is all the more concerning, therefore, when vessels come to our waters and engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Regional estimates put earnings lost to IUU at anywhere from millions to over $1 billion. For economies like ours, those numbers are staggering, and if we are to be true to the 2030 Agenda and the commitments made to the small island developing States, we must do much more to eliminate IUU fishing and ensure that the income from fishing goes to the rightful resource owners.
That and other issues from the 2030 Agenda will require us to rethink the way we cooperate at the international level. Our international and regional bodies must be fit for purpose. The universality of that endeavour will require them to respect national differences and move away from one-size-fits-all
15-29568 15/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
strategies. Thematic silos must be replaced by cross- cutting networks. Implementing agencies at every level must become both more nimble and more robust.
All partnerships — whether multilateral, bilateral or public-private — must be based on mutual respect that recognizes genuine development partners, such as the Republic of China on Taiwan, a democracy that can contribute meaningfully towards development and prosperity in the world. Needless to say, Taiwanese technology and know-how can make a lot of difference towards helping the needy, and, as such, I call for the inclusion of Taiwan in the development agencies of the United Nations.
Aid must be predictable and sustainable, It should not be wielded as a weapon to advance partisan political ends. Predatory relationships that pit one group against another have no place in the 2030 Development Agenda. History has demonstrated that openness and engagement have proven far more effective strategies for positive change than isolation and exclusion. Only in such an environment can we hold one another accountable for the full implementation of the Agenda.
That is the vision that Nauru has embraced for the 2030 Agenda, and back home we are taking steps to move forward. Like the United Nations itself, we will need to build strong domestic institutions to achieve our goals. Their legitimacy will similarly rest on their inclusiveness, adaptability and accountability. Therefore, in implementing the 2030 Agenda, we must go beyond capacity-building. We must engage in the difficult task of institution-building. International and regional agencies and development partners should back those efforts with real resources that include long- term, in-country engagement when appropriate, so that they leave behind durable domestic institutions run by a skilled national workforce.
Nauru is asking for a lot from its development partners. We want to be better partners ourselves. And at the end of the day, implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda will happen mostly at national and local level. On that note, let me thank our partners Australia, Taiwan, Russia, Cuba and others for their support towards our sustainable development priorities.
Our efforts to improve the legitimacy of international institutions must extend beyond those most directly involved in the 2030 Development Agenda. The Security Council in particular must better reflect the geopolitical realities of the world today.
Therefore, the list of permanent and non-permanent members should be expanded. We support the inclusion of Germany, India, Japan, Brazil and others in the permanent category. In addition, the Security Council must continue to adapt and respond to the most pressing issues of today. That is why Nauru calls on it to make climate change a permanent agenda item. It should be supplemented by the appointment by the Secretary- General of a Special Representative on climate and security. In addition, relevant organs of the United Nations should assess their capacity to respond to the security implications of climate change.
The governance of the Bretton Woods institutions should also be made more representative, with developing countries given a greater presence. The global economy has become more reliant on the flow of international capital, and with the frequency of financial crises increasing, the legitimacy of those institutions will continue to be tested.
However, climate change will be the largest test of our international and domestic institutions. We have already seen how some climate impacts can overwhelm the capacity of even the most powerful among us. Clearly, a strong, legally binding agreement in Paris is absolutely critical, with ambitious mitigation contributions from all countries. The agreement should be guided by a temperature-increase goal of 1.5°C, consistent with our vision of a safe and secure world. It must also ensure that climate financing is available for adaptation, particularly for the most vulnerable countries. And for dealing with the impacts that exceed our adaptation efforts, it should anchor an international mechanism on loss and damage.
The United Nations was created
“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind”.
At present, climate change, if left unaddressed, promises impacts no less catastrophic for many of our nations.
Today marks the lead-up to a very important milestone in my people’s history — the seventieth anniversary of our return home. During the occupation of my country in the Second World War, Nauruans were forcibly evacuated to what is now Chuuk state in the Federated States of Micronesia. Due to widespread food shortages and the harsh conditions imposed by our
16/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
captors, our population fell to below 1,500. We were in danger of extinction. Nauruans know very well what happens to small, vulnerable countries when the big ones fail to address their problems in a responsible manner.
I strongly believe that many of the major economic Powers want to reach an agreement at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris. Many have already come forward with meaningful mitigation contributions that will certainly require a great deal of effort to achieve. While we know it is not enough, I do not doubt their sincerity. However, I am starting to doubt whether they are willing and able to make the fundamental changes in their political and economic systems required to achieve our ambitious goals. The intense lobbying to accept an unsatisfactory outcome has already begun, and in the international process, that has often meant that we will be presented with a take-it-or-leave it deal at COP21. Would such an agreement have any legitimacy? Can we solve the climate problem without it?
The number 70 has biblical significance in the Christian faith, as it is composed of the numbers 7 and 10. The number 7 often represents the concept of completeness, while the number 10 often refers to law and responsibility. It is fitting that during the seventieth session of the General Assembly we will complete our work on a new set of global agreements to tackle the challenges of our generation. The number 70 can also represent a period of judgement. We stand at a critical moment in history as civilization outstrips the natural boundaries of our planet. Our response during the next few years will determine the fate of future generations for the next thousand years. Will we continue to march to an inexorable decline? Or will we join together to meet the challenges before us? Thankfully, we still have a choice ,and the widespread recognition of the need for change I have heard during the past week gives me hope that we will make the right one.
May God bless the Republic of Nauru and may God bless the United Nations.
"
70,2015,BRB,"I would like to begin by congratulating Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency of General Assembly at its seventieth session. He represents a country, Denmark, whose service to the United Nations and the global community has been exemplary. I anticipate that in upholding those fine traditions, Mr. Lykketoft will guide us judiciously as we embark on the journey towards the Organization’s centenary. I assure him of Barbados’ full support as we begin to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), striving collectively to address the diverse challenges that States Members of the United Nations are facing. I also take this opportunity to express the sincere admiration
of my delegation for the sterling manner in which his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, so ably guided the work of the General Assembly during its sixty-ninth session.
Three score and ten years ago, 50 delegations, assisted by a temporary Secretariat, gathered in San Francisco to sign the Charter that established the United Nations. That was a moment whose consequences have been felt across space and time and resonate with a unique power to this day. Of course, Barbados, like the overwhelming majority of countries that today make up the United Nations, was not among the countries represented in San Francisco on 26 June 1945. Only 50 delegations gathered then, representing, generally speaking, the victors of the Second World War. In stark contrast to that select group gathered on that summer day in 1945, the membership of this Organization today totals 193 States and represents virtually all of humankind.
In Paris in December, 196 delegations, including that of Barbados, will gather for the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. At that meeting, we will agree on collective action that will make possible the continued survival of our planet. That is an existential issue for all countries, but in particular for those like mine that are small island developing States. Our countries stand on the edge of the yawning abyss opened up by climate change. For those who framed the Charter of the United Nations, the cessation of global wars was the single existential threat. While that threat undeniably remains today, it would be to our peril not to accord climate change the same deadly capacity to threaten our planet.
Barbados and all the countries of the Caribbean Community have made clear their views on what should be the outcome of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention. All parties should commit to taking individual and collective action to curb greenhouse gas emissions in line with our ambitious goal to hold the average global temperature increase to well below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and all parties should commit to cooperating on taking such action and submitting to regular five-year cycles of reporting, verification and updating on mitigation commitments. All parties should also commit to supporting the particularly vulnerable countries, which are the small island developing States and the least developed
8/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
countries. In short, we need an ambitious, high- performance, legally binding agreement with global participation.
The tragedy that struck our sister Caribbean nation of Dominica, battered last month by Tropical Storm Erika, highlights the urgency of an effective global response to climate change. As we have often seen, a single natural or man-made disaster in a small island developing State can have catastrophic economic, infrastructural and humanitarian effects on a national scale, It has been estimated that the damage caused by Erika set Dominica’s development back by 20 years. As Chairman of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community, I take this opportunity to express the region’s unwavering solidarity with and commitment to our brothers and sisters in Dominica, and I call on the international community to continue to help Dominica in its hour of need.
History is a superb teacher. Seventy years on from the creation of the United Nations, it is appropriate that we reflect on the path that small States like mine have helped to prepare. It is a path made possible in large part by the principles that this Organization has embraced from its inception, which are embodied in the Charter and in the many treaties, resolutions and plans of action of the United Nations. It is a path from exclusivity to universality, a path that has seen a near quadrupling of the Organization’s membership in 70 years, and a path towards an international legal order that seeks to balance the rights of States with their responsibilities, including their responsibilities to their citizens.
Without question, those changes combine to reflect a significant and positive transformation of the international system — a transformation that has seen the country that I have the honour to represent move from subordination under colonial status to full sovereignty. In 2016, Barbados will proudly celebrate the fiftieth year of its independence and its membership in the United Nations. The United Nations has provided a forum where all countries, irrespective of their size or geopolitical influence, can meet, discuss and sometimes argue, always on an equal footing.
The transformation of the United Nations has provided the necessary but hardly the sufficient conditions for the Organization to realize the extraordinary promise expressed in the Preamble and Article 1 of the Charter. Member States have by and large failed to eliminate the scourge of war, and
relations among nations are not everywhere friendly. International cooperation has not, by itself, solved many international economic, social, cultural or humanitarian problems, nor has it everywhere encouraged respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The United Nations has not proven able to harmonize the actions of nations in the attainment of those common ends. And for small developing countries in particular, the promised emphasis on development has yet to be fully realized.
Development is a plant of tender growth and cannot flourish in an environment where there is no peace. It is therefore heartening to learn of the reduction of tensions between the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Cooperative Republic of Guyana, which was facilitated by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Over the years the tensions between those two countries had the effect of stymying the development potential of Guyana. I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to express my country’s unwavering commitment to the territorial integrity of Guyana and to state our support for a juridical solution to a dispute that has lasted far too long.
Is it permissible to inquire whether the world is a safer and more peaceful place today than it was in 1945? While there have been no world wars of the kind that precipitated the founding of this Organization, proxy wars and internecine, fratricidal conflicts have proliferated. The United Nations has registered many successes in addressing the myriad challenges to peace and security that have confronted the international community over the past 70 years. However, as Member States, it is our responsibility, and ours alone, to ensure that the United Nations is equipped and empowered to do much more.
Like many around the world, we in the Caribbean are deeply concerned about the connected crises of refugees and internally displaced persons. We regret that the international community has failed to take the firm political action necessary to bring those crises to an end. We underscore that if people are able to live in peace and security and in an environment that respects their human rights, they will feel less compelled to flee their countries, which they have often done under conditions that place their lives, and those of their children, in peril. We cannot afford to be indifferent. As Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel has noted: “Indifference is always the friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor.”

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
I have described the contours of an international system radically different from the one established when the United Nations was born 70 years ago. Collectively and individually, we struggle to address many of the problems that we now face.
In 2013, the General Assembly adopted the Arms Trade Treaty (resolution 68/31) to regulate international trade in conventional weapons, with the expectation that it will contribute to the prevention and eradication of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. Through the determined efforts of the countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and other like-minded States, small arms and light weapons and their ammunition, parts and components were included in the scope of the Treaty. Barbados was, therefore, pleased to ratify the Arms Trade Treaty in May of this year.
In July of this year, under the presidency of New Zealand, the Security Council held its first-ever open debate on the particular peace and security challenges facing small island developing States (see S/PV.7499). At that meeting, Barbados indicated that it has always opposed, and continues strongly to oppose, the proliferation and use of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. However, for countries like Barbados, the real weapons of mass destruction are small arms and light weapons, and our focus is necessarily on the trade in those weapons, which often goes arm-in-arm with the traffic in illicit drugs and other forms of organized crime. Both have the capacity to seriously undermine our economies and destabilize our societies. Barbados welcomes the initiative and persistence that made possible the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty and commits to playing its part in addressing global peace and security challenges.
Also in July of this year, we adopted the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (resolution 69/313, annex), which provides a series of bold measures to overhaul global finance practices and generate investments for tackling a range of economic, social and environmental challenges.
Finally, last week we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which formulates a new development agenda based on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The link between the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda is clear: the former sets out the Goals and the latter the means of their attainment. One without the other is bereft of meaning.
I take this opportunity to connect those important initiatives to a concern that the countries of the Caribbean Community and others have been expressing for some time, most recently during our meeting of Heads of Government in July, which, this year, Barbados had the honour to host. The United Nations and the international financial institutions must address the matter of the graduation of middle-income countries, such as Barbados, from access to concessionary and grant-based financing. Now, we contend, is the time to develop and utilize appropriate measurements for development that go beyond a simplistic reliance on a country’s gross domestic product per capita.
It was with especial pleasure that we received the news earlier this year that, 43 years after Barbados and three other CARICOM member States —Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Guyana — had ended their diplomatic isolation of Cuba, the United States of America has decided to do the same. For Barbados, that must be seen as a positive development, as we have been calling consistently, insistently and persistently since 1972 for an end to the economic embargo, which has not only retarded the development of Cuba but has also cheated its people of the opportunity to fulfil their aspirations, as they should. My delegation congratulates President Barack Obama of the United States of America for the hindsight, the insight, and the foresight that informed his decision and looks forward to the process of Cuba’s total embrace through the removal, in the near future, of the economic embargo.
In a similar vein, it is not without significance that 21 months before we adopted the 2030 Agenda, the General Assembly adopted resolution 68/237, which proclaimed the International Decade for People of African Descent, under the theme, “People of African descent: recognition, justice and development”, commencing on 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 December 2024. The Decade was launched by the Secretary-General in December 2014, with the keynote address delivered by Barbadian Professor Sir Hilary Beckles, then Pro- Vice Chancellor of the University of the West Indies. My delegation confidently expects that as we pursue the Sustainable Development Goals, due regard will be accorded to the reparative justice contemplated not only by the theme of that very important Decade, but also by its specific mention in the programme of activities for the implementation of the Decade.
Permit me to reach back again into our Organization’s history, for it continues to illuminate our
10/45 15-29816

present and to set out the way forward for our future. When he took office as the first Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Norwegian diplomat, Trygve Lie, said at one of the earliest meetings of the General Assembly, on 2 February 1946:
“The purpose of the United Nations is the maintenance of peace in an atmosphere of international security and general well-being ... But there is a close connection between the peace problem and the economic and social conditions of the countries of the world.” (A/PV.22, p. 325)
Barbados, a small island developing State, has been and remains a staunch supporter of the United Nations, committed to the principles of multilateralism and the sovereign equality of States and to the inextricable link between peace and security, on the one hand, and economic and social development, on the other. Today those principles, we are proud to say, are nowhere better reflected than in the ideals to which States Members of the United Nations still subscribe in their collective march to promote, for the peoples of the world, social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.
"
70,2015,GUY,"The Cooperative Republic of Guyana is honoured to participate in this historic session of the General Assembly. We would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election, and pledge Guyana’s cooperation as you guide the Assembly in the fulfilment of its tasks. We would also like to thank your predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his stewardship in piloting the post-2015 agenda. That
process has culminated in the historic 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). The Sustainable Development Goals it contains reflect the common consensus within the international community on the elements that are integral to human development.
The United Nations, established 70 years ago and a mere five months after the formal end of the Second World War, became the midwife of a new international order. That new order of world peace was depicted symbolically and powerfully in the form of a bronze statue on the grounds of the Headquarters of the United Nations. It embodies the vision revealed in the Holy Bible in the Book of Isaiah that states,
“And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” (The Holy Bible, Isaiah, 4:2)
That prophetic verse became the philosophical basis of the United Nations, which became the organizational foundation for a global order that saw the emergence of a plethora of newly independent States, a result of the decolonization process after the Second World War. In the years since its establishment, 126 States have gained their independence.
The United Nations began in 1945 with a membership of only 51 countries, but today that has almost quadrupled to 193. The majority of new States are mini-, micro- and small ones. The undemocratic and warlike empires of which they were colonies were dismantled after two world wars. These are the questions that small States ask of the United Nations on this, its seventieth anniversary: How will our peoples be protected from foreign aggression? How will our territories be safeguarded from invasion? How will peace among nations be preserved? How will the independence of the new States be sustained? The Charter of the United Nations charges our Organization with the responsibility
“to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes”.
That responsibility is essential to the existence and survival of small States that are threatened by more powerful ones. They risk being subjugated unless the international community can demonstrate a
2/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
commitment to providing an effective deterrent against their domination by larger, stronger States, and the capability to do so.
On 9 May 1994, at its forty-ninth session, the General Assembly adopted resolution 49/31, which, among other things, recognizes that small States may be particularly vulnerable to external threats and acts of interference in their internal affairs; stresses the vital importance for all States of the unconditional respect by all States of all the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including the principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and the peaceful settlement of disputes and their consistent application; also stresses the importance of strengthening regional security arrangements by increasing interaction, cooperation and consultation; appeals to the relevant regional and international organizations to provide assistance when requested by small States for the strengthening of their security in accordance with the principles of the Charter; requests the Secretary-General to continue to pay special attention to monitoring the security situation of small States and to consider making use of Article 99 of the Charter; and calls on the Security Council and other relevant organs of the United Nations to pay special attention to the protection and security of small States. That is a manifesto for small States, contained in a resolution adopted by the General Assembly 21 years ago.
Guyana is a small State and a new State, a product of the post-Second World War promise of peace. Guyana is a child of the United Nations. Eight months from now, on 26 May 2016, Guyana will mark the fiftieth anniversary of its independence. But for 50 years, our small country has been prevented from fully exploiting its rich natural resources. Venezuela has threatened and deterred investors and frustrated our economic development. For 50 years it has violated our territorial integrity by occupying part of our territory, the most recent incident in that regard being on 10 October 2013, when it sent a naval corvette into our maritime zone and expelled a peaceful petroleum- exploration vessel conducting seismic surveys. For 50 years Venezuela has promulgated decrees making spurious claims on our territory, the most recent on 26 May, our independence anniversary, when it issued decree number 1,787, containing specific coordinates that would annex almost our entire maritime zone, and
constituting a reassertion of Venezuela’s claim to 5 of Guyana’s 10 regions.
Guyana rejects Venezuela’s threats and claims, made in defiance of international law, and we resist its acts of aggression, conducted in defiance of the Charter of the United Nations, which prescribes the peaceful settlement of disputes and proscribes the use of armed force.
Guyana’s borders with Venezuela were settled 116 years ago. The entire world, except the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, accepts and acknowledges our borders. In 1968, at the Assembly’s twenty-third session (see A/PV.1680), Guyana explained to the world how in 1897 a treaty of arbitration was signed between the United Kingdom and Venezuela. That treaty provided for the establishment of an arbitral tribunal to determine the boundary line between the colony of British Guiana, as we were then, and Venezuela. It committed the parties to consider the result of the proceedings of the tribunal of arbitration as a full, perfect and final settlement of all the questions referred to the arbitrators. The tribunal issued its decision on 3 October 1899, awarding Venezuela 13,000 square kilometres of our territory, an area bigger than Jamaica or Lebanon. Venezuela was bound under international law to respect that decision, which it did for the next six decades.
From the beginning of Guyana’s independence, however, Venezuela has resorted to various stratagems to deprive us of our territory. There has been a series of acts of aggression by Presidents of Venezuela against my country, from President Raúl Leoni Otero’s decree number 1,152 of 15 June 1968 to President Nicolás Maduro Moro’s of 26 May of this year. Venezuela — more than four times the size of Guyana, with armed forces that are more than 40 times the size of our defence force — mindful of its superior wealth and military strength, but unmindful of its obligation as a Member of the United Nations, the Union of South American Nations and the Organization of American States, has pursued a path of intimidation and aggression. It is unsettling a settled border. It is destabilizing a stable region of the globe by the use of armed force against a small, peaceful State. Venezuela has retarded Guyana’s development through its use of threats that are intended to force a small State to yield up its birthright. Its expansionist ambitions cannot be allowed to undermine the principle of the inviolability
15-29431 3/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
of borders and the tenets of international law, and to redraw borders that have gone undisturbed for decades.
Guyana recommits to preserving the Caribbean as a zone of peace. Today we renew our pledge before the Assembly that we will pursue the path of peace for all time. We reaffirm our commitment to the peaceful settlement of international disputes. Guyana has total confidence in international law, and seeks a resolution of this controversy that is consistent with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.
The Geneva Agreement, signed on 17 February 1966, between the Governments of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Venezuela and British Guiana, as we were then, provides for action to be taken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in order to resolve any contention occasioned by the claim made by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela that the arbitral award of 1899 is null and void. Guyana has full confidence in the judgement and capacity of the United Nations, through the Office of the Secretary-General, to identify solutions that will validate the just, perfect and final nature of its decision. We thank the United Nations and the Secretary-General for appointing various officials during the past 25 years to use their good offices to help to resolve this controversy. We feel, however, that the process has now been exhausted.
Guyana does not want this obnoxious territorial claim to obscure our country’s prospects for peace and obstruct its potential growth for the next 50 years. We need a permanent solution if we are to avoid a fate of perpetual peril and penury, and we seek a juridical settlement to the controversy. We put our faith and our fate in the hands of the international system of peace promised by the Charter of the United Nations nearly 70 years ago. We want to bring an end to Venezuelan aggression. We want to develop our country, all of our country, in accordance with international law. Guyana therefore calls on the United Nations to give real meaning to resolution 49/31 of 9 May 1994 by establishing a collective security system designed not merely to monitor but also, more importantly, to maintain the security of small States. That resolution, as I said, is a manifesto for the security of small States.
The United Nations remains our best hope and prospect for peace, the best assurance of security for small States. It is our strength, support and succour in times of danger. We pledge Guyana’s adherence to the Charter of the United Nations. Guyana seeks
nothing more than the solidarity of the international community, the assurance of the Charter and the safety of international law.
"
70,2015,CYP,"This year marks the seventieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations, and provides us with an opportunity to take stock of the past seven decades, as well as to jointly discuss and exchange ideas on how to further improve the Organization’s effectiveness and its members’ collaboration, with the benefit of humankind always in view. In order to assess our collective efforts, we
should first recall the guiding principles that led to the establishment of the United Nations in the aftermath of the death and destruction of the Second World War. The Preamble to the founding Charter of the United Nations establishes the eradication of the scourge of war and the promotion of human rights as the cornerstones of our edifice.
So far, the United Nations has succeeded in preventing another world war and has helped to end conflicts through mediation. Currently, more than 100,000 United Nations peacekeepers are deployed in 16 countries. Yet numerous armed conflicts all over the planet attest to the fact that global peace still evades us. In the area of human rights, the United Nations has undertaken inspiring initiatives, starting with the adoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and followed by many international agreements and treaties setting universal standards for civil, political, social and economic rights. Yet in a world challenged by poverty, hunger, child mortality and social and economic inequalities, it is evident that we have a long way to go.
At the same time, leaving aside the strengths and weaknesses, successes and failures of the United Nations, we should not undermine or underestimate the fact that in an interdependent world it provides the only international forum in which nations can interact, deliberate and negotiate so as to resolve not only their differences, but also pressing regional and international challenges that are not country-specific and that call the international order into question.
In order to enhance its value and influence in a globalized era, the United Nations has evolved, with its recent adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). The 2030 Agenda seeks to address the needs of a developing global population through its commonly agreed 17 Goals and 169 targets. Cyprus, which has been actively involved in the process since its very beginning, is proud of this achievement, since it reflects our high principles of effective multilateralism and close cooperation among the nations of the world.
However, while on the one hand we have achieved the adoption of such an ambitious agenda, on the other we are also witnessing the ongoing turmoil, extremism, sectarianism, civil war and terrorism that are taking place in the Middle East, North Africa and other regions. Their effects — death, persecution,
32/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
dispossession of property, displacement, destruction of cultural heritage and forced migration — are becoming defining features of the daily lives of those affected. We must therefore be vigilant, for while we are attempting to establish fundamental principles of peace, stability and sustainable development for the future, in practice we are seeing the increasing migratory flows of those who are involuntarily fleeing their homes in search of a better future. As we strive to set up noble, long-term objectives and goals, events that are currently unfolding may render them irrelevant or unattainable. When we assume that only Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and, more recently, Europe are affected by the current refugee crisis, we fail to acknowledge that if it persists, other countries and continents will be affected as well.
In order to reverse those worrying developments, therefore, we should direct our efforts so that every country and region in a conflict zone, particularly the Middle East and North Africa, can become a place in which sustainable development is a reality. That can be achieved only by tackling the root causes that have led to this unprecedented situation — that is, political instability and economic insecurity. We should address this collectively and comprehensively. It is not enough to take action against the individuals responsible for terrorist attacks; we should focus our efforts on the enablers of terrorism. It is not enough to rescue people from sinking boats; we should focus our efforts on human traffickers. It is not enough to support economic immigrants financially; we should focus our efforts on creating the political and socioeconomic conditions that can ensure that all these people do not emigrate from their countries.
In view of this horrific humanitarian crisis, one might wonder if we have neglected to take the necessary measures to avert this crisis. Has our strategy been adequate? Have we failed to predict the events that have unfolded? Considering Cyprus’s proximity to the Middle East and North Africa, as well as our historical, political, social and cultural links, I am firmly convinced that the international community has failed to sufficiently appreciate those regions’ complexities. At the same time, foreign interventions and involvement have not produced the hoped-for results, because they have failed to take into account and understand those nations’ internal characteristics and particular sensitivities.
I would like to quote a remark made by the Secretary-General at a ceremony in San Francisco on
26 June commemorating the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the Charter.
“Today, we take the idea of the United Nations for granted, but bringing it to life required huge leaps of statecraft to bridge differences.”
And while we recognize how valuable and necessary the United Nations is today, we can also see that it is in need of reform and modernization to enable it to tackle today’s realities.
The international order and perspectives of 1945 are not the same as those of 2015. Traditional security orientations have changed due to new geopolitical circumstances. Issues of peace and stability can no longer be confined to the differences between and within nations, when non-State actors such as terrorists have challenged the established international order, paving the way for religious fundamentalism, violent extremism, the forcible displacement of people and forced migration.
At the same time, new global threats such as climate change and environmental degradation have also emerged, After 70 years, world leaders must once again demonstrate statesmanship and vision in order to rebuild newly broken societies and find a path to renewal. In that regard, we welcome the recently adopted resolution 69/321, on revitalization, as well as the ongoing dialogue towards enhancing the effectiveness of the Security Council. We also support the upcoming high-level United Nations meetings aimed at resolving a number of global challenges, including the United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Paris in December; the special session on the world drug problem, in April 2016; and the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, in Quito in November 2016.
Peacekeeping constitutes one of the main pillars and accomplishments of the United Nations. However, the United Nations is not only about peacekeeping; it is also about conflict prevention and peacebuilding. Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations provides a wide gamut of options for the peaceful settlement of issues. We look forward to concrete proposals for adapting United Nations peacekeeping operations to the changing nature of conflict and for enhancing their effectiveness and their ability to promote political solutions. In that regard, we greatly welcome the 2015 review of United Nations peacebuilding operations (see
15-29431 33/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
A/70/95), and we compliment the Secretary-General for undertaking that initiative.
Cyprus, through its own experience of hosting a United Nations peacekeeping force, greatly values the contribution of the United Nations to the maintenance of peace and security. We also express our appreciation for the plethora of United Nations resolutions and Security Council decisions that have condemned the unacceptable status quo and the violent and ongoing division of the island, calling for its reunification and the withdrawal of occupation forces — resolutions and decisions that, unfortunately, have yet to be implemented.
Following the non-renewal of actions that violated the exercise by the Republic of Cyprus of its sovereign rights within its exclusive economic zone and the change in the leadership of the Turkish Cypriot community, a window of opportunity opened, reviving our hope that the round of negotiations that resumed in May will lead to a final settlement of the Cyprus problem. That hope is based on my conviction that both I and the Turkish Cypriot leader share the same courage and resolve to advance decisively towards making the joint vision of our peoples — who desire the solution of the Cyprus problem through a viable, lasting and functional settlement — a reality. That settlement must be in full conformity with the values and principles of the character of the United Nations and the European Union acquis, as well as with the high-level agreements between the leaders of the two communities and the joint declaration of 11 February 2014. Such a settlement would lead to the evolution of the Republic of Cyprus as a federal State in a bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality, single sovereignty, a single international legal personality and a single form of citizenship; a State that is and will continue to be a Member of the United Nations, the European Union and numerous other international organizations, and whose sovereignty, territorial integrity and constitutional order will not be constrained by anachronistic systems of guarantees by third countries or the presence of foreign troops on the island.
What we aspire to achieve through this new round of negotiations is to reach a settlement in which there will be neither winners nor losers; that takes into account the sensitivities and concerns of both communities; that respects the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all Cypriots, Greek and Turkish alike; that reunites our country, its people, its economy
and its institutions; that creates a homeland of peaceful coexistence and prosperous collaboration among all its citizens, to the benefit of the younger generations; that allows Cyprus to realize its full potential by removing all political barriers that prevent the full exploitation of its unique geographical position at the crossroads of Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Asia; that transforms Cyprus into a shining example of ethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic cooperation between Christian and Muslim communities; and that turns Cyprus into a model of reliability, stability and security in a turbulent and volatile region currently characterized by protracted conflicts and instability.
I am pleased to inform the Assembly that, during the new round of negotiations, progress has been achieved on a number of issues that touch on almost all chapters of the Cyprus problem. However, on other substantive issues, significant differences still need to be resolved — differences whose resolution will also require the active and determined contribution of Turkey, whose occupation forces remain in the northern part of our country. 1 sincerely hope that Turkey’s rhetorical assurances of its desire to reach a settlement will at last be tested in practice through the adoption of concrete measures that will positively underpin the negotiation process and reflect the current climate of hope on the island.
I strongly believe that reaching a solution to the Cyprus problem could become a paradigm for the way in which diplomacy and the adoption of a conciliatory stance can prevail over mistrust and contribute to the resolution of even the most difficult international issues. Furthermore, the discovery of hydrocarbon reserves in the Eastern Mediterranean has the potential to create synergies and a grid of alliances for broader cooperation between hydrocarbon-producing and hydrocarbon-consuming countries of the area and beyond, to the benefit of the socioeconomic development and welfare of our peoples. Such positive developments can foster the achievement and maintenance of a much- needed environment of stability and peace in our immediate neighbourhood.
I am certain that the General Assembly shares the view that the settlement of the Cyprus problem will create a win-win situation, not only for its people, but also for the region, the interested parties and the international community at large.
"
70,2015,AUS,"We meet this day at an important time for the United Nations, 70 years after its foundation. Australia’s representative to the San Francisco Conference in 1945 described the General Assembly as the place where the conscience of the peoples of the world should have its most potent expression. It is appropriate then, here in the General Assembly Hall, to reflect on what the United Nations has achieved and what it needs to achieve for the future.
The United Nations provides critical services each and every day in many parts of the world. Often this important work goes unnoticed or unappreciated by those not in direct receipt of that support. Australia recognizes the dedicated, often courageous work of the thousands of United Nations personnel in the field who protect vulnerable citizens, deliver vital humanitarian assistance, rebuild damaged societies and support development. The United Nations carries out its work in an increasingly hostile environment.
Today the world faces an unprecedented number of long-running and seemingly intractable conflicts, generating displacement on a massive scale and making humanitarian need more dire than at any time since the Second World War. Terrorism today is a global threat. The magnitude of the development challenge is immense. However, we must acknowledge the remarkable achievement that is the United Nations Charter. The values and aspirations articulated seven decades ago still guide us today.
Australia is proud that, as an active participant at the San Francisco Conference, we crafted a central element of the Charter, Article 56, known as the Australia Pledge. Under that Article, United Nations Members pledge to take action individually and jointly to promote higher standards of living; solutions to international economic, social, health and related problems; and universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms. Australia took that pledge on signing the Charter in 1945. Today I reiterate that pledge.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), adopted unanimously last Friday by the General Assembly, is a manifestation of the
16/23 15-29595

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18
Australia Pledge and a testament to the fundamental role of the Organization. Only the United Nations could have produced this remarkable result. The Sustainable Development Goals are necessarily ambitious. Let us consider just the first five: to end extreme poverty everywhere; to end hunger; to ensure quality education; to ensure healthy lives; and to achieve gender equality. Should we realize all 17 Goals, we will transform our world for the betterment of humankind.
We must ensure that the remarkable spirit of cooperation displayed during the negotiation process is maintained as we work to turn these ambitious goals into reality. The 2030 Agenda recognizes that economic growth, including through private-sector investment and trade, is central to sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda also recognizes that while official development assistance remains important, it is only one source of financing for development. The 2030 Agenda affirms that it is the quality of assistance that matters, and that true partnerships for development are essential, based on respect and cooperation. That is what Australia seeks to achieve with our friends and neighbours in the Pacific.
Climate change is a challenge for all nations and decisive action is required. We will succeed in reducing global emissions only if there is engagement by the entire United Nations membership. Australia has announced a strong, responsible and achievable post- 2020 contribution to international climate action. We are committed to ensuring the United Nations Climate Conference in Paris at the end of the year is the platform needed to secure a collective approach to the below 2° goal.
There is an inescapable truth. We cannot transform our world unless the place of women within it is transformed. The 2030 Agenda requires us to achieve nothing less than full gender equality. This is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do. It is essential to achieve sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth. Australia has established a $50 million gender equality fund to accelerate support for gender equality in our development programme delivered in our region, the Indian Ocean/Asia-Pacific.
We must step up the fight against the global scourge of violence against women and girls.
Last week the Australian Government announced a new domestic policy, a $100 million women’s safety package, improving front-line support services
and providing educational resources to help change community attitudes to violence and abuse. Similarly, our overseas aid programme helps countries in our region in efforts to eliminate violence against women and girls. The United Nations women, peace and security agenda has changed our collective thinking on the role of women in conflict. We now need to put it into practice. That is why Australia has worked with the United States to produce the first military commanders’ guide for implementing women, peace and security in the field.
A key element of the 2030 Agenda is that peaceful and inclusive societies are essential to achieving sustainable development. Human rights, good governance and open and inclusive institutions are crucial foundations for development. Human rights have been at the very centre of the United Nations over the past 70 years, from the United Nations Charter in 1945 to the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015.
With the rise of terrorist groups like Daesh, the continuing depredations of the North Korean regime, and the persistence of forced labour and other contemporary forms of slavery, the need for the United Nations to prosecute a strong human rights agenda has never been more pressing or urgent. Australia is standing for a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council for the 2018-2020 term. This is the first time that my country has sought election to that body. I believe that Australia would bring to the Human Rights Council the same principled and practical approach that distinguished our 2013-2014 Security Council term. Should we be elected, our focus would be on empowering women and girls, strengthening governance and democratic institutions, promoting freedom of expression and advancing human rights for all.
Australia would be at the forefront of efforts to hold to account those responsible for human rights abuses and to build more effective preventative and accountability measures. We would be unrelenting in our efforts to secure abolition of the death penalty. Our term on the Human Rights Council would reflect Australia’s inclusive, diverse society and build on the Australian Government’s strong domestic human rights agenda.
There are nations for which the aspirations of the 2030 Agenda, indeed the promises of the United Nations Charter, appear remote or unachievable. The scourge of war continues to tear apart families, communities, countries and entire regions. As a non-permanent
15-29595 17/23

A/70/PV.18 29/09/2015
member of the Security Council, we experienced first- hand the difficulties the Council faces in responding to the crises and conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Mali. Nowhere is the devastation greater than in Iraq and Syria. Daesh is wreaking unspeakable havoc and harm on individuals, families and communities and destroying the world’s cultural heritage in gross violation of international law and against the fundamental concepts of morality. It cannot be allowed to prevail.
Australia is participating in coalition military action to combat Daesh in Iraq and Syria. We are doing so within the framework of the Charter and in a manner consistent with international law. Defeating Daesh requires both military and political action. Reconciliation and inclusive governance in Iraq are the key to reducing Daesh’s appeal and support. We continue to advocate a political solution that can bring an end to the conflict in Syria and we support United Nations Envoy Staffan de Mistura’s efforts towards that end.
We do not believe any transition option should be rejected. All permutations of a political solution should be assessed with clear-eyed realism. Australia is committed to defeating terrorism in all its forms. We are responding to the challenges of violent extremism and foreign terrorist fighters, taking on those who would exploit our openness and modern communications to commit violence and promote terror. The humanitarian consequences of the conflicts in Syria and Iraq are devastating. I commend neighbouring countries Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, which continue to bear the brunt of the population of displaced persons. Australia has provided $230 million in humanitarian assistance since the start of the conflict.
The massive flows of displaced people across the Middle East and into Europe have stretched response capacities to a breaking point. In this environment, people smugglers will strive to prosper from their dangerous and criminal trade. Australia’s firm response to people smuggling, and continued cooperation with its regional partners, have saved the lives of thousands who would otherwise have succumbed to the false promises of people smugglers. It has also enabled us to give refuge to those most in need. Consistent with our record over decades of resettling permanently thousands of refugees, Australia was pleased to announce recently that we would resettle permanently an additional 12,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq — registered by
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees — particularly those who are unlikely to have a home to which they might return. We also announced $44 million in funding to support 240,000 displaced persons on the borders.
The global humanitarian system is struggling to cope with the escalating demands. The World Humanitarian Summit in May next year must deliver a nimble humanitarian system which responds to different types of humanitarian crises in the most effective fashion. The only long-term solution to these man-made crises is a political one — to bring these conflicts to an end.
Australia’s recent experience as a Security Council member confirmed that the Council’s role is more essential than ever. The Security Council can perform its role only if it has the tools it needs. The role of peacekeeping is fundamental. Yesterday, I joined others in pledging renewed operational support for the United Nations peacekeeping system. Australian airlift was vital to the United Nations early response to the South Sudan crisis. We have now pledged to provide our C-17 Globemasters and C-130 Hercules aircraft to help United Nations peacekeepers respond to crises where and whenever we can in the future.
We recognize that the United Nations needs more tools for peacebuilding to help vulnerable States emerge from crises and prevent them from falling back into violence and disorder. Australia is looking forward to co-chairing with Angola the consultations on the peacebuilding architecture review later this year. We need to strengthen this crucial element of conflict prevention.
Another central lesson from Australia’s term on the Council was that accountability is crucial in preventing cycles of violence. The International Criminal Court has a critical role to play and requires our support. Australia remains determined to hold to account those responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in July 2014. We owe nothing less to the families of those aboard that fateful flight. We will not let a Russian veto impede the efforts of countries grieving the loss of their citizens and demanding justice for the perpetrators of this atrocity.
All States must uphold their responsibility to protect civilians from the most serious international crimes. Security Council members have a particular responsibility to do so. In that context, we welcome
18/23 15-29595

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18
proposals to restrain use of the veto where mass atrocity crimes are being committed. Australia’s term on the Security Council in 2013-2014 demonstrated that elected members can play an active and constructive role. I am therefore pleased to announce that Australia is nominating itself to serve again on the Council for the 2029-2030 term.
We do not underestimate the challenges facing all of us. Equally we should not downplay the opportunities. We remain confident that working together we can realize the enduring promise of the Charter — for Australians, for our region, and for the international community. And now 70 years on, the General Assembly is indeed the place where the conscience of the peoples of the world has its most potent expression.
"
70,2015,IRL,"It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly this afternoon on behalf of Ireland on the sixtieth anniversary of my country’s joining the United Nations and the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations itself. At the intersection of these two special anniversaries, it has been a great privilege for Ireland to have co-facilitated the final negotiations of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the implementation of which is critical for the future of our planet and its people.
The SDGs are a tangible manifestation of the capacity of the United Nations to deliver positive outcomes in the most challenging circumstances, but we cannot be complacent. On the contrary, in this anniversary year, we must critically appraise our failures, as the international community, to prevent war, genocide, forced displacement and deprivation. Today we face unprecedented challenges in confronting the savage violence of well-resourced non-State actors, as well as of some States, with consequential humanitarian catastrophes unfolding in many parts of the world.
Strong and assertive leadership by the United Nations has never been as critical. I know the United Nations and its Members can live up to this great challenge.
In our 60 years at the United Nations, Ireland has pursued a series of policy priorities that continue to be central to our foreign policy. They include peacekeeping, non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, development aid, promoting peace and security while we were on the Security Council, and advancing gender equality. I will touch upon these policies and outline their continuing relevance for Ireland today.
In the 1950s, when Ireland joined the United Nations, our then Prime Minister, John A. Costello, identified our goal as playing “our part to secure what small nations have always required, the maintenance of peace”. We are extremely proud that the loyal service of Irish peacekeepers has been central to our negotiations with the United Nations since 1958. On 12 occasions our soldiers have led United Nations missions. There are currently 370 committed and courageous Irish peacekeeping troops serving in seven United Nations missions; 87 Irish peacekeepers have tragically lost their lives in the active service of the United Nations.
Ireland feels a strong sense of responsibility to protect the reputation and honour of United Nations peacekeepers. We owe this to our peacekeeping troops, past, present and future. And so, like Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon, we received reports of sexual abuse involving some United Nations peacekeepers with shock and outrage.
United Nations peacekeeping missions must never be associated with exploitation because of the actions of a few. Ireland will always speak out to defend the vulnerable. We will not be silent about the plight of women and children harmed by the very people responsible for their protection. Those serving under the United Nations flag have a fundamental responsibility to behave in an honourable way and to be a force for good in this world.
Ireland demands decisive action in confronting any criminal behaviour by United Nations troops. This is vital to protect the good name of the United Nations and its peacekeepers, the overwhelming majority of whom are principled people. We want appropriate training, clear accountability and strict sanctions. I welcome the Secretary-General’s commitment to making the United Nations firm zero-tolerance policy into an effective zero-crime reality.
50/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
United Nations peacekeeping and Ireland’s contribution have adapted in scale and complexity to challenges over the past six decades. Continuing flexibility and innovation are essential. I therefore welcome the report of the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations and its comprehensive analysis of the challenges ahead and the changes required (A/70/95). In particular, our own experience of conflict in Ireland has taught us that full and equal participation by women in decisions around peace and security are vital to building a sustainable peace.
I now turn to the 1960s. From our earliest days at the United Nations, Ireland has been passionately committed to disarmament and non-proliferation. As the first State to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1968, following several years work as initiator of the General Assembly resolutions that led to its agreement, we have a deep and abiding commitment to the full implementation of the Treaty. Indeed, significant progress has been made on non-proliferation. We warmly welcome the agreement reached with Iran and look forward to its implementation. More broadly, we hope that this will also mark the opening of a new and constructive chapter in Iran’s engagement in the international system. Conversely, the outcome of the 2015 NPT Review Conference in May was deeply disappointing. States with nuclear arsenals have special responsibilities, and Ireland will continue to press them to deliver on their commitments under the NPT.
Today there are at least 17,000 nuclear weapons posing a threat to our very survival. We cannot accept that status quo. Ireland wants real momentum injected into the nuclear disarmament pillar of the NPT. The SDG negotiation process underscored the very positive role that civic society groups and people around the world can play. Ireland would like to see that positivity, inclusivity and urgency in the nuclear disarmament debate.
We see the daily consequences of illegal and irresponsible flows of arms and conventional weapons in the appalling scenes of chaos and brutality into which parts of our world have descended. The scenes in our newspapers and on our television and computer screens are truly horrific. People wonder what can be done to stem this industrial-scale violence.
Part of the solution is the Arms Trade Treaty, one of the international community’s most significant achievements in recent years. Ireland was one of the
first States to ratify the Treaty, and we have offered financial support to enable wider participation in negotiations and more effective implementation. The onus is now on all States parties to maintain the immense and sustained effort we put into negotiating the Treaty. We must ensure that we live up to its great promise, with the ultimate goal of enhancing peace and security and thereby saving lives.
Now to the 1970s. In 1974, having acceded to the European Union the previous year, Ireland established its programme of overseas development cooperation, Irish Aid. Since then Ireland has provided over $13 billion in support of the world’s most impoverished people and has championed the aid agenda within the European Union, which is the world’s largest provider of development assistance.
Last week at Headquarters, world leaders adopted the new Sustainable Development Goals for the period up to 2030. We have committed ourselves to an ambitious programme and transformational agenda to end extreme poverty, to preserve the planet for this and future generations and to create conditions for balanced economic growth throughout the world. Reaching agreement on these Goals is one of the most important achievements of the United Nations in recent years. It was an enormous challenge, and we, the 193 Member States, rose to it. That was multilateral diplomacy at its best.
The United Nations has demonstrated its continuing relevance and, indeed, indispensability. I am proud that Ireland was able to make its contribution through the co-facilitator role played by Ambassador David Donoghue and his team in the negotiations which, working with Kenya, brought about this landmark agreement. Moving to successful implementation of this huge global agenda will be the next great challenge. We do not underestimate the challenges for all countries in implementing a universal agenda that is as broad and diverse as the new SDGs, but we cannot underestimate the huge achievement and benefits for humankind if it is successfully implemented.
Our development gains are threatened by the unprecedented scale of humanitarian crises facing our world. The total number of refugees and internally displaced people worldwide has now surpassed 50 million people. In Europe, we have clearly seen the tragic consequences for those who, driven by desperation, are taking inconceivable risks to find a safe haven for their families. Addressing the migration

crisis is a huge challenge for Europe and one that we are working hard to resolve. People are fleeing their home countries for a multiplicity of reasons. They are arriving in Europe from a multiplicity of routes. They undertake perilous journeys, often exploited by ruthless criminals along the way. This is a disaster that requires the close collaboration of the international community.
The United Nations is undertaking vital work in seeking to address the root causes of mass migration and to provide humanitarian assistance to those who have been driven from their homes by the ravages of war. I urge States to work with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Migration — an Irishman, Peter Sutherland, who is dedicating himself to assisting in the resolution of this global catastrophe. Ireland supports the humanitarian effort by providing crucial funding and other resources. We have deployed search-and-rescue ships to the Mediterranean. We are providing for the resettlement of over 4,000 refugees.
Ireland welcomes the Secretary-General’s setting up of the High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing to address the growing gap between humanitarian needs and resources. We will participate fully in that and other processes leading to next year’s World Humanitarian Summit.
In the 1980s, Ireland completed its first full term on the Security Council, motivated by its commitment to multilateralism and a rules-based international system. These values are under grave threat today. Russia’s unlawful annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine have had profound implications for the people of Ukraine and for the international system itself. Ireland calls on all sides to respect and fully implement the Minsk agreements and to cooperate with the peacebuilding efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in the region.
During our first term on the Security Council in 1981 and 1982, the Middle East was, as ever, prominent on the international agenda. Today, challenges in the region are even greater. In Syria, over 200,000 people have lost their lives and over 11 million people have been displaced. The Al-Assad regime continues to flout international law, while the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) inflicts gratuitous cruelty and suffering on the people of Syria and northern Iraq. Its casual barbarism is a threat to every value the United Nations holds dear, and therefore the United Nations has a duty to act.
Elsewhere in the region, Ireland remains concerned at the continued stalemate in the Middle East peace process. We are strong advocates of the two-State solution as the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace for the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.
In our pursuit of peace on the island of Ireland, we were, and continue to be, supported by steadfast partners who stayed the course with us through many difficult years, keeping faith where others saw hopelessness. In our wide-ranging work on conflict prevention, mediation and State-building, we seek to share our experience. We hope to bring this to the table when we seek election to the Security Council again in 2020.
I turn to the 1990s. Historically, Ireland has supported the promotion and protection of human rights, from our early support for decolonization to our opposition to apartheid in South Africa and through to our election to the Human Rights Council for the term 2013 to 2015. In 1997, our former President, Mary Robinson, was appointed the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. At the Human Rights Council, Ireland has sought to give concrete expression to the long-held convictions that have informed our positions within the United Nations. We have championed resolutions to promote and protect civil society space, which we recognize as essential to make other rights attainable. We advocate for the critical role of human rights defenders. We have led initiatives to prevent the morbidity and mortality of children under 5.
In Ireland, there is widespread concern about violent repression and terrorist attacks on religious minorities. We have seen an alarming rise in attacks on Christians, Baha’i, Jews and Muslims. Elsewhere people are oppressed and punished because of their gender, race or sexual orientation. In short, vulnerable minorities are under increasing attack from repressive State regimes and from transnational terrorist networks including ISIL, Al-Qaida, Boko Haram and others. The United Nations, as a champion of equality, plurality and diversity, has an important role to play in defending and protecting vulnerable groups. We fully support the Organization in this essential task.
This year Ireland became the first country in the world to legalize marriage equality by a popular vote. This has been a hugely positive experience for Ireland, and we urge other States to follow suit and to promote rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender
52/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
and intersex citizens. Similarly, Ireland has had its own historic experience of religious repression; therefore, religious freedom is a matter of great importance to my country.
Turning to the 2000s, I wish to emphasize Ireland’s grave concern for vulnerable women and girls in many parts of the world and our strong commitment to gender equality. In the year 2000, just before our last membership of the Security Council, Ireland co-sponsored resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, reflecting our strong national commitment to this agenda. I hope that Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon may be succeeded by a brilliant female Secretary-General in due course, because that would send a powerful message to women and men throughout the world that here, in the United Nations, we are willing to remove the barriers that prevent women from fulfilling their true potential.
We strongly endorse the code of conduct on Security Council action on mass atrocity crimes, developed by Liechtenstein and the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group, and we support the declaration by France and Mexico on regulating the use of the veto. Ireland is ready for membership in 2021 of a much reformed and more representative Security Council, one that is better equipped to respond to twenty-first -century threats to international peace and security.
Realizing the United Nations core values in every Member State will mean a fairer, more prosperous and sustainable world for this generation and all those who come after. I wish to conclude with the words of the late Irish poet Seamus Heaney, “I have begun to think of life as a series of ripples widening out from an original centre”.
In 2015, a very special anniversary year for us all, it is time to reflect on our own original centre — the United Nations Charter — and for all 193 Member States to recommit ourselves to delivering on its great promise: a peaceful, just and prosperous world.
"
70,2015,KAZ,"In this seventieth anniversary year, it is fitting that we reflect on the profound hopes of the founders of the United Nations.
This universal Organization has already achieved historic goals of universal significance. First, for seven decades our planet has lived without world wars. Secondly, we have witnessed large-scale decolonization. Seventy years ago, the United Nations was established by 51 States at a time when the majority of the world still consisted of colonies and dependent territories. Today, the world community includes 193 independent countries. Thirdly, the United Nations has become a universal platform for dialogue, which is essential for the sake of security and development. In the United Nations, humankind recognizes its unity in diversity and the need for shared participation in shaping the fate of our planet. The generation that founded the United Nations was wise enough to look far into the future. The world today is reaping the benefits of their dreams and hard work.
Kazakhstan supports all initiatives aimed at restoring trust in international relations and strengthening peace and security on the basis of international law. For seven decades, the world community has tried to find an effective formula for resolving military conflicts. However, the number of conflicts has not decreased. Rather, conflicts are often transforming into more sophisticated and complex forms of international terrorism, as may occur in a climate of State collapse.
Humankind needs to shift its focus from routine conflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation to a new development strategy that would make such conflicts meaningless. To that end, we should find the courage to look beyond the present to the time when the United Nations will celebrate its centenary. I believe that, in the next thirty years, the civilized world will find the necessary wisdom and will to cut through the Gordian knot of wars and conflicts. Our central task in the twenty-first century should be to implement a strategy that will, once and for all, eliminate the threat of war and its causes. To that end, I propose that, for the centenary of the United Nations, agreement should be reached on a 2045 global strategic initiative plan, whose core idea will be to launch a new trend in global development based on equitable conditions in which all nations have equal access to global infrastructure, resources and markets and accountability for human development is comprehensively maintained.
First, I propose that the Economic and Social Council be transformed into a global development council. Membership of the new body would consist of Member States elected by the General Assembly and the heads of all the United Nations specialized agencies, including the International Monetary Fund. The new Council should be tasked with becoming a global economic regulator. Global projects carried out by such a Council would aim to promote worldwide economic growth. That would go a long way towards decreasing the risks of global crises and to ensuring responsible behaviour by States, while enabling them to maintain their national economic and social policies.
We consider the idea of a world anti-crisis plan, the draft of which is being actively discussed on the margins of the Astana Economic Forum, to be very timely. The most pressing and serious global challenges — terrorism, the implosion of States, migration and other negative issues — are the result of the economic crisis, poverty, illiteracy and unemployment.
To tackle the global crisis, we need to start with clear rules for the issuance of and trade in the world’s reserve currencies, because they do not now meet the criteria of justice, democracy, competitiveness, effectiveness and international control. In the twenty-first century, our world needs new, high-quality financial instruments. States Members of the United Nations need to join forces to create a new supranational currency that should be relevant to the targets and tasks of global sustainable development and prosperity.
Secondly, in the year of the seventieth anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I urge that a world without nuclear weapons should become the main goal of humankind for the twenty-first century. I propose that we adopt, under the auspices of the United Nations, a universal declaration aimed at achieving a world free of nuclear weapons. Kazakhstan was the first country in history to close down a nuclear test site, renouncing the world’s fourth-largest nuclear arsenal, and has contributed to the creation of a nuclear- weapon-free zone in Central Asia. It is essential to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in other regions of the world, particularly in the Middle East. The nuclear Powers must provide guarantees of the non-use of force to all countries that renounce possession of nuclear weapons.
In 2013, we initiated two rounds of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme in Almaty. We welcome the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action regarding Iran’s nuclear programme. It is essential today to guarantee the right of States to peaceful nuclear energy and access to nuclear fuel. That is why we supported and signed an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency on the establishment of a low-enriched uranium fuel bank in Kazakhstan. That was an event of global significance. The world should acknowledge it as an important measure for the safe and peaceful use of the atom, as it means that countries wishing to develop nuclear energy no longer need to enrich uranium themselves. Moreover, we consider the creation of a global anti-nuclear-weapons movement an important task. Every person on the planet can and must contribute to a nuclear test ban.
Thirdly, a further danger for us is the erosion of international law and the weakening of the role of global institutions. It is important to remember that the Charter of the United Nations was written with the blood of millions of victims of world wars and armed conflicts. Any violation of its articles, especially with respect to ensuring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, may cause humankind to repeat the tragic mistakes of the past.
It is crucial to prevent the arbitrary imposition of sanctions, which contradicts both the Charter and international law. I am convinced that the right to impose international sanctions, which can adversely affect the well-being of millions of people, should remain the exclusive prerogative of the Security Council. Failure to comply with that principle undermines the
foundation of the modern world order and is a relic of the Cold War. I would like to stress that there is no alternative to the United Nations as a universal Organization. Moreover, countries’ compliance with their international obligations remains the cornerstone of the modern world order.
Kazakhstan has consistently advocated a peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian crisis and the full implementation of the Minsk agreements by the parties to the conflict. Today it is vital to make every effort to restore dialogue, mutual understanding and trust in international relations. I therefore propose the convening in 2016 of a United Nations conference at the highest level with the aim of reaffirming the basic principles of international law.
Fourthly, the threat of terrorism and religious extremism has become global in scale. I propose the establishment, under the auspices of the United Nations, of a unified global network to counter international terrorism and extremism. To achieve that objective, it is necessary to develop and adopt a comprehensive United Nations instrument on combating terrorism.
Fifthly, in support of the United Nations initiative on sustainable energy for all, we will hold, in 2017 in Astana, an international exhibition on the theme of the energy of the future. We invite all States to participate fully in the exhibition. Looking to the future and using the infrastructure to be put in place for Expo 2017, I suggest opening in Astana an international centre for the development of green technologies and investment projects under the auspices of the United Nations.
A major step in realizing the 2045 global strategic initiative plan could be the development, under the auspices of the United Nations, of the concept on which a new future is to be based. Seventy years after the founding of the United Nations, we need to clearly define the goals of the next stage in the evolution of humankind. I believe that that new future will be about ways to deliver nuclear energy and water, address food security, build trust and mutual understanding and carry out reforms.
Kazakhstan has been and will continue to be a mediator in efforts to help conflicting parties in Eurasia to find a peaceful solution. The directions and principles I have outlined constitute the core of our campaign to become a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the biennium 2017-2018. I call
on all those participating in the seventieth session to support our country’s candidacy.
Seventy years ago, when the United Nations was established as a replacement for the defunct League of Nations, which had been located in Geneva, the decision was made to establish its headquarters in New York. That was connected to the fact that, at the time, the role of the Western hemisphere in international affairs was still in the ascendant. The centre of economic development had also moved from the Old World of Europe to the New World of the United States, in New York.
Our world has changed a great deal since then. In the twenty-first century, the pole of global growth is shifting to Asia, the world’s largest continent, where two thirds of the planet’s population lives and where enormous resources are concentrated. The powerful rise of Asia’s developing economies has introduced a new reality into global processes. We need to use that historic change and opportunity to give a new boost to relations between States. With that in mind, I propose that Member States consider the possibility of transferring United Nations Headquarters to Asia. I am hopeful that this and Kazakhstan’s other proposals will be acceptable to the community of nations.
"
70,2015,KGZ,"I would first like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and wish him every success in this high position of responsibility. At the same time, we would like to express our gratitude to the President of the General Assembly at its sixty- ninth session, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his very fruitful leadership.
I would also like to congratulate States Members of the United Nations and the Secretariat, headed by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the Organization and the adoption of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and the Sustainable Development Goals. We welcome the theme of this year’s session, “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”, which clearly and eloquently speaks for itself.
This year also marks the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, which was the most bloodthirsty and destructive war that humankind has ever experienced. We believe that the most important outcome of the war was, first and foremost, the defeat of the forces of fascism. The war also ended policies based on an inhuman ideology and attempts to overthrow the world order. This victory provided an opportunity to affirm such values as the recognition of the freedom and equality of peoples and the universality of international law, which meant an end to a planet divided into great Powers, on the one hand, and the rest of the world, on the other. In this context, we consider that the United Nations has played a historic role as the international Organization whose membership includes almost all
15-29876 13/26

A/70/PV.24 01/10/2015
the countries on the planet and to which any State can turn if it feels that its rights have been violated or its security challenged.
Today, the United Nations plays a clear role in improving the well-being of the citizens of the world. The Organization remains the only legitimate universal structure in the field of multilateral diplomacy and intergovernmental cooperation. Kyrgyzstan recognizes the central role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security, in addressing today’s challenges in the financial, economic, social, cultural, humanitarian and environmental spheres, in promoting and protecting human rights, and in strengthening friendly relations between countries, in keeping with the principles of international law.
We firmly advocate taking into account the various interests of all nations, in accordance with international law, and building a peaceful world order based on a multilateral approach. We believe that it is just this type of development of international relations that the United Nations should promote.
Ironically, the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War and the creation of the United Nations, which has become a symbol of unity, collaboration and cooperation, coincides with a very alarming international situation. One quarter of a century after the end of the cold war, the international community is once again facing the threat of a polarized world, brazen violations of fundamental rules of international law, the growth of armed conflict and other negative phenomena. Instead of the demolished Berlin Wall, we have new walls being built — those of sanctions, bans and trade barriers.
Differences have increased among the members of the Security Council, which of course is not conducive to the maintenance of international peace and stability. We are in fact facing a situation where some States prefer to act outside the Security Council. We consider such an approach counterproductive and not in keeping with the very purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. It leads to increasing differences, a loss of trust and confidence, the destabilizing of the international situation and a new arms race.
During the recent United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, each of us took note of the event’s importance and took upon ourselves the obligation to collectively ensure over the next 15 years that humankind will develop sustainably, in harmony
with nature. Kyrgyzstan welcomes the adoption of the 17 overarching Sustainable Development Goals and all of their related targets. We will make every effort to fully implement them as best we can with our national capacities. We will also continue to work in a targeted way to meet the Millennium Development Goals that have not been entirely achieved yet.
At the same time, achieving sustainable development at a national level requires solving the issue of appropriate and adequate international financing. That issue was fully and intensively discussed by the least developed countries and donors at the third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa in mid-July. We agree with the view that developing States should take greater responsibility for financing their national development programmes through the effective use of internal resources, including by improving their tax administration and, of course, by fighting corruption. However, donor countries will also need to remain involved and should promptly fulfil their commitment to increasing their official development assistance to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product.
At the same time, we wish to underscore the need for an environment conducive to the successful sustainable development of States and the possibility of creating and maintaining such an environment. In the light of our national experience, Kyrgyzstan believes that every State has the right to development, which is an inherent, inalienable right that cannot be limited or constrained by anyone or anything. We are convinced that the issue of upholding that right is relevant for the majority of developing States throughout the world. It seems to us that it is especially important in the case of landlocked developing States, of small island States and all other countries that are especially vulnerable in the face of climate change, and of heavily indebted States, which do not have the opportunity to eradicate poverty.
We regret to note the increasing number of situations in which one State, guided only by its self- interest, strives to further its own development at the expense of another State by constraining the latter’s opportunities for development. We believe that such conduct has no place in today’s civilized world. At the same time, we note that the concept of a State’s right to development has not yet been incorporated into general international law. Of course, it is important to clarify that the right to development does exist and is part of
14/26 15-29876

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24
international law, but only within the framework of human rights. I refer first and foremost to the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, among other documents. However, we believe that the relevant human rights cannot be fully implemented unless an analogous right is granted to the subject of international law itself.
We believe that respect for and guarantees of the right of every State to development should in time become the foundation for forging new, equitable international relations at the global level and should take their place alongside such other principles as respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, rejection of the use of force and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States. In that regard, my country considers it important for the concept of a State’s right to development to be widely disseminated throughout the United Nations. We propose that the issue be considered at the expert level.
Successful sustainable development depends to a great extent on the maintenance of security and stability at the global level. We believe that countries should set aside their differences and work more actively together under the aegis of the United Nations to combat terrorism and violent extremism. Kyrgyzstan strongly condemns all acts of terrorism, irrespective of their motivation and without regard to where and by whom they are committed. Terrorism has root causes and reasons, but they can never be justified. We would like to stress that the international community needs to work together more effectively to combat not only extremism but also its violent manifestations.
Today we are seeing the nature of extremist threats morph and change. To a lesser degree, activities of this nature have already spread geographically. Extremist ideology is seeping into the consciousness of people in various regions and around the world; it is mounting an attack on society from within. Various extremist and terrorist organizations, after consolidating their power under the banner of a single ideology, are evolving into powerful criminal structures with a wide network of like-minded people.
We believe that combating extremism should not be limited to addressing violent methods but that it must also include the adoption of preventive measures to curb the influence of harmful ideologies. In the effort to combat extremism, it is also crucial for States to develop policies that protect the secular character
of the State and to strengthen their interaction with traditional religions by implementing their citizens’ right to freedom of religion.
Speaking of counter-terrorism activities at the national level, I would like to note that Kyrgyzstan has faithfully fulfilled its obligations and that it is committed to constructive engagement at the national, regional and international levels in the fight against that evil. We see Security Council resolution 2178 (2015) as a decisive step in combating foreign terrorist fighters. Within the framework of its implementation, we have focused our efforts on strengthening border controls, aviation security and building the capacity of law enforcement agencies, as well as on improving the exchange of information.
In February and May, our courts characterized the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the Al-Nusra Front and other organizations as terrorist and extremist and banned their activities in Kyrgyzstan. On 24 July, a law was adopted that establishes accountability for mercenary activities and the participation of citizens in armed conflicts or military actions on the territory of a foreign State. Our law enforcement agencies have been active in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, and we are determined to continue the fight.
We are sincerely interested in the peaceful and stable development of our brother country, Afghanistan. Exactly one year ago, we witnessed the inauguration of President Ghani Ahmadzai and the formation of the Government of National Unity headed by Mr. Abdullah Abdullah, which marked the first democratic transfer of power in the history of Afghanistan. We consider it important to set the Afghan economy on a path of stable and sustainable development, which is crucial in the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking. We call upon the international community, particularly donors, to fully comply with their commitments to provide assistance to Afghanistan. For its part, Kyrgyzstan is ready to work closely with Afghanistan on regional trade, energy and communication projects.
The current situation in the Middle East, a region torn by protracted conflicts and sectarian violence, is of particular concern, as thousands of innocent people, including women and children, are being killed. We call on the countries of the region and the conflicting parties to start direct negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations, in order to reach a political solution to the problem. Without strong political will
15-29876 15/26

A/70/PV.24 01/10/2015
and determination, it will be impossible to stop the bloodshed and to pave the way for national unity, reconciliation and reconstruction. We believe that external intervention in any conflict should remain a last resort and should be used only with the approval of the Security Council.
At the same time, we believe that special attention should be paid to the emergence of new challenges to world civilization. Those new challenges differ from the more traditional challenges of inter-State conflicts; rather they take the shape of ideological conflicts. Such challenges do not arise solely in situations of religious extremism; they also appear in numerous situations in which one State attempts to impose its vision of development on other States. In that context, a principled assessment of such practices is essential, regardless of the source of the ideology. We believe that the permanent members of the Security Council — which, as the victorious Powers of the Second World War, took responsibility for the fate of the world — should now likewise assume the responsibility to combat such practices, which undermine the very basis on which development of inter-State relations rests.
It has been 70 years since the first use of a nuclear weapon occurred, and 45 years since the date of entry into force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Yes, humankind has managed to prevent a recurrence of the use of nuclear weapons. However, as long as nuclear weapons exist, the risk of their intentional or even their unintentional use will remain. We regret to note that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has not yet entered into force, and that the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ended without the adoption of the most important outcome document.
In such circumstances, the Treaty on a Nuclear- Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia represents a significant contribution to the global process of nuclear disarmament. As the depositary and the coordinator of the States parties to the Treaty, Kyrgyzstan expresses its appreciation to the Russian Federation, China, France and Great Britain for their ratification of the protocol on negative security assurances and urges the United States to ratify that instrument without further delay.
We have recently witnessed the successful completion of the long-running negotiations between Iran and the group of six countries as well as the
adoption of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear programme. I wish to congratulate the group and the Islamic Republic of Iran on the occasion of this historic event.
As a member of the newest nuclear-weapon-free zone, Kyrgyzstan urges the countries of the Middle East to establish in the region a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. This would serve as a milestone in the field of disarmament, thereby promoting peace in the Middle East.
One of the most important instruments in terms of sustainable development is upholding the security of the State. Here we deem crucial the strengthening of the entire spectrum of cooperation with our neighbours. Inclusive dialogue and cooperation, in our view, are the only ways to resolve the problems in our region.
On the other hand, it must be noted that not all of the existing problems in the region of Central Asia can be successfully and rapidly resolved. We refer here primarily to the development of trade and economic relations on an equitable, fair and mutually beneficial basis.
Efforts remain insufficient in the areas of resolving border issues, coordinating efforts to promote regional security, liberalizing trade rules, harmonizing national legislation and ensuring safe transit over inter-State roads and railway lines. The coordination of approaches to developing the energy and transportation sectors remains insufficient.
Issues related to the shared use of water resources are also a focus of Central Asian inter-State relations. In this regard, it should be noted that in the implementation of the national development course it has chosen, Kyrgyzstan intends to focus in particular on the development of our hydropower potential as the basis for the sustainable development of our country. Our principled position is that our water resources and our energy potential are closely linked. So to achieve its right to development, Kyrgyzstan has been using its water resources to achieve sustained social and economic development, including on the basis of the model of the green economy.
No less important at the regional level is the fact that a number of border issues have not yet been settled, although their successful resolution is clearly in keeping with the interests of all States in the region.
16/26 15-29876

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24
This will increase transit trade potential and promote the development of border infrastructure in our country, which would improve the economy and help reduce social tension in the region.
Against that backdrop, we believe that the development of a comprehensive regional cooperation framework would be fundamental to ensuring sustainable development, stability and security for the whole of the Central Asian region.
The absence of a direct multilateral political dialogue among the Central Asian countries themselves exacerbates regional problems and constrains the economic development of our countries. Unfortunately, however, we are forced to note that the common problems we face do not mean that our countries form a united front when addressing these problems in international forums.
We believe that the time has come to create a broad platform for dialogue among all five Central Asian States. It is vital to create such a new, high-quality mechanism within the framework of which we could discuss issues related to trade, economy, borders, energy, water use, transport interfaces, the environment and climate change. We call on our neighbours to consider our initiative. Kyrgyzstan, in turn, stands ready to start discussing the details of such a new regional platform.
In the political Declaration of the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit (see resolution 70/1), we agreed to strengthen democracy, good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights, as well as to ensure economic growth, all of which make a positive contribution to sustainable development. We fully agree with this concept and intend to make a worthy contribution to international efforts to that end. However, it should be pointed out that Kyrgyzstan has its own historical policy on and path towards democracy; it is fundamental to our national identity. For centuries, democratic values have formed the basis of our society; they are not foreign, abstract ideas. Kyrgyzstan, based on its own historical and cultural experience, has been consistently developing and strengthening its model for national governance based on the principles of parliamentary democracy.
Kyrgyzstan will soon hold parliamentary elections, which will serve as an indicator of the country’s level of democratic development. Their outcome will strengthen the principles of openness and togetherness of our people. The elections will be held on the basis
of the democratic principles of openness and fairness, in accordance with national legislation and our international obligations.
In August of this year, a historic event took place when Kyrgyzstan became a full-fledged member of the Eurasian Economic Union. That membership provides Kyrgyzstan with unrestricted access to a regional market for goods and services, capital and labour and with a further opportunity to develop our agriculture and industry, as well as our transport and transit potential. Participation therein will also enhance the competitiveness of our national economy and its integration into the world economy.
At the same time, as a result of our recent positive accomplishments, in 2014 the World Bank moved Kyrgyzstan from the category of poorest countries to that of middle-income countries. In order to maintain sustainable economic growth in Kyrgyzstan, 2015 was declared the “Year of Strengthening the National Economy”.
I would also like to note that we in Kyrgyzstan are waging an uncompromising fight against corruption. In 2014, Kyrgyzstan improved its status in international community rankings on corruption, moving from 150th to 136th place. We are determined to continue to work in this direction in accordance with the international campaign to strengthen good governance.
The protection of human rights is one of the main priorities of our State policy. My country seeks to fulfil all of the obligations it has undertaken under the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights treaties and agreements. Today in Kyrgyzstan there is freedom of the press, and civil society is developing actively. We have also strengthened inter-ethnic relations.
Kyrgyzstan has put forward its candidacy for election to the Human Rights Council for the period 2016-2018. Here I would once again request the States Members of the United Nations to back our candidacy in the elections, to be held in October this year.
By way of conclusion, I wish to revisit the topic of the creation of the United Nations 70 years ago, which infused us with a sense of confidence in the future and has become the embodiment of the best of universal ideals and a champion of the interests of peoples of the world. In the 70 years of its existence, the United

Nations has firmly established itself as an effective and universally recognized centre for international security and responsibility.
The achievements of the United Nations include mechanisms for conflict prevention, impartial mediation, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. The United Nations has also become one of the most important tools for resolving socioeconomic, financial, cultural, humanitarian and other problems at the international level. Its specialized agencies, funds, programmes and structures are highly relevant and much needed and often function as effective partners for developing countries.
Today humankind is experiencing a very difficult time its development, and the United Nations is being tested in terms of its ability to promote the modern world order. In this situation, we must pool the efforts of the Member States in addressing global challenges and threats to international security and sustainable development. At the forefront of this campaign should be a reformed United Nations, one that enjoys political and financial support from its Member States. In this respect, I encourage all to support and strengthen our Organization.
Kyrgyzstan, for its part, will always cooperate actively and responsibly with the United Nations to support its activities to find joint solutions to global problems.
"
70,2015,CAN,"I am honoured to appear before the Assembly today to deliver these remarks on behalf of the Government of Canada in this, the seventieth anniversary year of the United Nations.
As a founding Member of the United Nations, Canada played a constructive role in drafting the Charter of the United Nations and creating the Organization before, during and after the 1945 San Francisco Conference. There can be little doubt that over the past seven decades, through the General Assembly, other United Nations bodies and the myriad
of agencies, funds and programmes associated with the United Nations, the Organization has often helped to improve the lives and prospects of people around the world. It has done so even as Member States and the United Nations itself have struggled to realize the Organization’s most fundamental aspirations. Since that time, Canada and Canadians have been steadfast supporters of the United Nations and deeply engaged in its work to deliver results for the benefit of our common future.
One of the ways in which the United Nations led the way in its early years, and in which it continues to light the path ahead, has been in the vital area of international development. Canada is proud to support, in word and deed, the commitments in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). The Organization and the international community it represents deserve our praise for aiming to eliminate poverty on a global scale. It is an objective that will require innovative new approaches and new partnerships. We will also need to promote fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and accountable governance in those parts of the world where the critical building blocks for sustainable development are weak or absent.
Canada looks forward to collaborating with others to sustain the momentum already underway as a result of the Millennium Development Goals and to move forward with renewed determination. The Government of Canada has identified maternal, newborn and child health as a priority for development, in support for which we have committed $3.5 billion over the next five years. There has been progress, to be sure, but there remains much to do. Canada welcomes the inclusion of maternal, newborn and child health in the 2030 Agenda as a means to follow through on the commitments made under the 2010 Group of Eight Muskoka Initiative, adopted at the Saving Every Woman, Every Child Summit, held in Toronto in 2014, and the renewed Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health.
As the international community commits to implementing the 2030 Agenda, one of the most critical questions we still face is how to finance the Sustainable Development Goals. While current official development assistance will retain its important role, current and projected levels fall well short of the trillions of dollars required to implement the Goals. We need to find new ways to blend financing from donors, foundations, the private sector and other sources to fill the gap.
15-29946 17/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
The Global Financing Facility (GFF) in support of Every Woman, Every Child is an excellent model of how the private sector can be brought on board to collaborate with national Governments to sustainably finance maternal, newborn and child health initiatives. The additional investment generated through the GFF and other innovative financing mechanisms will set the course for increasing funding from the current billions of dollars allocated for development finance to the trillions required if we want to achieve the post-2015 development agenda. Canada will continue to play a leading role in helping to establish those mechanisms to secure sustainable financing and leverage the expertise and resources of the private sector in support of the development outcomes.
Humanitarian assistance is even more important, as progress in development can be wiped out overnight by natural disasters, political violence and international conflicts or crises linked to acute food insecurity or the spread of disease. When considering the first-ever World Humanitarian Summit, to be held in May 2016, we all must strive to increase countries’ determination to respect international humanitarian law, to protect civilians and to strengthen resilience when faced with possible crises, in particular by ensuring that national Governments will be equipped to deal with those crises.
In responding to the needs of humankind, Canada always strives to act with generosity, speed and efficacy to save lives, to alleviate suffering and to preserve the dignity of the people most affected. In 2014, Canada increased by 32 per cent its financial contribution to humanitarian assistance in response to the ever-increasing needs in the world, especially for countries in crisis, such as Iraq, Syria, the Philippines, Ukraine, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Yemen. Similarly, Canada has played a leading role in the prompt and effective action by the international community to the Ebola epidemic in certain regions of West Africa.
As shown at numerous times in the past, Canada has the capacity and the will to assist and deal with the crisis of refugees and migrants currently affecting Europe. Since the establishment of the United Nations, the international community has been confronted with many situations brought about by the voluntary and involuntary displacement of people. In some cases, such as those of individuals trying to escape the crisis
in Syria, the issue is urgent. In others, it is part of a long-term phenomenon. We work in collaboration with our partners to address those difficulties, including by accelerating the resettlement process of Syrians and Iraqis in our own country this year.
We know that Canadians will support those efforts with the same spirit of generosity that has characterized the assistance they have provided when others were in distress and affected by disasters. However, we cannot stop there; we must also take on together human rights violations and promote stability, peace and prosperity in regions subjected to instability or violent conflicts. The United Nations, rooted in respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, democracy and the rule of law, was established specifically for that purpose.
Without the strong and collective commitment of all Member States to those principles, the edifying words of the Preamble to the Charter risk becoming simply hollow and meaningless words. In the words of the Prime Minister of Canada:
“Where human misery abounds, where grinding poverty is the rule, where justice is systematically denied, there is no real peace — only the seeds of future conflict.” (A/69/PV.11, p. 11)
Canada continues to support a wide range of initiatives and measures established by the United Nations to promote peace and security, including the most recent efforts to combat terrorism and to identify new ways to combat violent extremism.
Innocent civilians suffer the most in internal and international conflicts, as we see today in Iraq and Syria, where the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) and other terrorist groups are sowing destruction. We are concerned by the resurgence of the Taliban in northern Afghanistan, by the scale of the ambition shown by Daesh and their expanding networks in South Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Sahel, as well as by their subsidiaries, such as Boko Haram. The international community must continue to take significant steps to combat terrorism together.
Faced with that situation, Canada’s action includes not only its role in the military coalition that is fighting against the immediate threat posed by Daesh, but also efforts to provide humanitarian assistance. Canada will continue to support ethnic and religious minorities whose very existence is threatened.

We are committed to drawing everyone’s attention to the consequences of sexual violence and other barbaric abuses perpetrated by ISIS against women and girls. Last July, we hosted the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Zainab Bangura, who presented graphic and detailed conclusions of her assessment mission to the Middle East to members of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, gathered in Quebec City. At that meeting, Canada announced an additional financial contribution for the survivors of abuses committed by Daesh and in support of the essential work being carried out by Ms. Bangura.
Canada has long been determined to work for the independence of women and girls and for greater respect for their rights in conflict situations. That is why we support a high-level review of the implementation of the programme on women and peace and security, as we have done for the past 15 years, that is, since the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), the first resolution on that issue. Canada has played a leading role in the global campaign to eliminate child marriage, early marriage and forced marriage, a widespread and harmful practice that threatens the lives and the future of girls around the world, with devastating consequences not only for them but also for their communities.
Our rules-based international system must be preserved. International guarantees lose their meaning if rules are flagrantly violated. We must face acute challenges to security and human rights, such as in Iraq and Syria, as well as the abuses that follow in the wake of acts of aggression, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the illegal annexation of Crimea and the continued interference in eastern Ukraine. This rostrum must not be used by leaders to subvert the principles on which this Organization was established. This platform should be used to respond to, and tackle, these global threats.
Two countries that persistently violate international standards in this area and whose Governments oppress their own people and threaten their neighbours, as well as global peace are Iran and North Korea. Non-compliance over the course of decades raises questions about ambitions and intentions. Verbal pledges or paper promises are not enough. There must
be verifiable evidence of compliance and meaningful penalties for continued defiance.
In that regard, while we appreciate the efforts of the P5+1, the real test of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action concerning Iran, or any similar agreement, will be in its concrete implementation and independent verification. Actions speak louder than words. To that end, it is vital to support, sustain and, where necessary, enhance the monitoring capabilities of the relevant agencies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, and ensure that verifiable deeds match conciliatory words. Nothing less than the credibility of the United Nations is at stake on such matters.
As with any organization, it is vital for the United Nations to reassess what it does and how it pursues its goals in the light of the remarkable changes since its founding. Canada wholeheartedly supports the high- level review of peace operations. We cannot always rely on the instruments of the past to deal with the crises of today.
Freedom, peace and stability pave the way to lasting prosperity. As we all know, the path to real sustainable development requires action at many levels and with many partners. Private-sector-led growth is a key ingredient for achieving that goal and for reducing poverty. Trade and investment are at the heart of that effort. That is why Canada is a firm supporter of a free and open trading system that fosters growth, contributes to development and supports poverty reduction in all regions of the world.
Perhaps no issue reminds us that we are all part of one world more than the threat to our collective well- being posed by climate change, a global challenge that requires global solutions. Canada takes the challenge of climate change seriously and is working with all parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to reach an effective post-2020 climate change agreement at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention, to be held later this year in Paris. For Canada, an effective agreement must address both mitigation and adaptation, and, most importantly, such an agreement must include a commitment to mitigation actions by all of the world’s major emitters of greenhouse gases.
On 15 May, Canada announced its post-2020 climate change target — an economy-wide reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. That is an ambitious target that is in line
15-29946 19/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
with other major industrialized countries and reflects our national circumstances, including Canada’s position as a world leader in clean electricity generation.
Canada recognizes that financing is a key part of the discussion and, moving forward with our partners, we will, as we have done in the past, continue to support international climate-change financing. Canada has already pledged $300 million to the Green Climate Fund, in addition to a previous investment of $1.2 billion that we provided under quick-start climate-change financing, which has supported a number of beneficial projects in more than 70 developing countries.
From the beginning, Canada has been one of the largest and most reliable financial contributors to the United Nations. In the light of that support, it should come as no surprise that the Government of Canada and Canadians expect that money to be spent wisely and that the United Nations should be held accountable for its expenditures.
As I said at the outset, the overarching aims of the United Nations since its creation have been remarkably consistent, namely, to help achieve greater prosperity and security, to advance mutual respect, fairness and good international conduct, and, ultimately, to inspire and sustain the hopes of people everywhere for a better future. With our friends and partners in the global community, we have striven to make this world a better place and to make the United Nations a better instrument for achieving those goals. We look forward to working together with other nations, as we have done for seven decades, in pursuit of that common purpose.
"
70,2015,AUT,"Seventy years ago, the United Nations was founded as the collective answer to war and genocide, which had cost the lives of millions of people. The principal idea of the United Nations was to prevent war, to uphold respect for international law and human rights, and to promote social and economic progress.
I myself have not lived through even half of this period. Nevertheless, I believe that today, 70 years later, we all have to ask ourselves if we have really succeeded. We are facing a record high of over 50 violent conflicts, stretching from Syria and Iraq to Yemen, the Sudan and Somalia. We are facing a rise in radicalization and extremism. And we are facing the highest number of refugees since the Second World War. Nearly 60 million people worldwide are on the move as refugees or internally displaced persons. Four million of them are Syrians who have left their country, fleeing from civil war and terror. Every day over 40,000 people flee their homes in search of peace, security or a new life. This challenge is not limited to one region or to one continent. It is a global challenge. It concerns the Mediterranean region, but also South Asia and large parts of Africa.
Europe is currently also witnessing a huge flow of refugees, in particular from the wider Middle East. These global refugee flows pose serious problems for the countries of origin and transit, as well as for the countries of destination. But all affected countries and regions have one thing in common: no country and no region can solve this crisis alone, and no single measure can provide a solution. We need a comprehensive approach covering all the refugee routes, including the countries of origin, transit and destination. Which organization, if not the United Nations, can provide the basis for this collective action? Which organization, if not the United Nations, can contribute to this comprehensive approach?
If we want to reduce the number of refugees, we have to focus our efforts on three key areas.
First, we have to confront the root causes in the countries of origin: civil wars and massive human rights violations and terrorism. In this context, we have to intensify our fight against Daesh and terrorist groups. They must be neutralized and defeated. In the case of Syria, it also means that we have to push harder for a closing of ranks in the region. We will be able to achieve meaningful progress only if major regional
48/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
players, such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Iran, act in concert. And finally, it means that we have to bring all relevant parties to the Syrian civil war to the table, as United Nations Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura is trying to do. Let me be clear: that does not mean that the current political leadership of Syria can be part of a long-term solution. It has brought endless harm to the people of Syria. But if one wants to make peace, one does not talk only to one’s friends.
The second point is that we need more unity at the international level. Huge efforts have already been made, but the United Nations and its Member States can and should do more. We will be able to make a difference only if we make it possible for the United States and Russia to pull in one direction. The Security Council has to demonstrate unity.
We need a mandate not only for action against Daesh, but also for the protection of civilians. It should include the establishment of safe zones and buffer zones, which would increase people’s security and make access to humanitarian aid much easier. Action by the Security Council would also make it possible for many countries to have the opportunity to join in and offer their support. Our position is clear: Austria would stand ready to contribute to such a United Nations peace operation.
Thirdly, we need a change of system. A system that allows only the fittest or those rich enough to pay the smugglers to reach a safe haven like Europe is wrong. The current system is in fact indirectly sponsoring smugglers. Since 2000 more than 24,000 migrants and refugees have died on their way to Europe. The pictures of refugees drowned in the Mediterranean Sea or suffocated in trucks will continue to haunt us. We therefore need a change of system. We need to create the possibility for refugees to apply for asylum in their countries of origin or neighbouring countries. The United Nations could help in the establishment of such reception and information centres, which would allow resettlement programmes to be introduced.
In my opinion, trafficking in human beings is one of the worst crimes. We should consider systematic and large-scale smuggling a crime against humanity, so that the perpetrators can finally be brought to justice.
There is another crisis area we should not forget about. Last year, like most of those present, I referred to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict as probably the most serious challenge to peace and security in Europe
(see A/69/PV.15). One year later, we still do not see enough positive development. The conflict is ongoing, the number of deaths has even increased, and the socioeconomic consequences are huge.
There is only one way ahead: a peaceful settlement based on dialogue and negotiation. We must find a solution that provides for a free and stable Ukraine enjoying strong ties with both the European Union and the Russian Federation. In this respect the Minsk agreement is and remains the only option on the table. There is no alternative to implementing that agreement. All parties have to live up to their commitments. In that context, let me underline the crucial work the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is doing. The Special Monitoring Mission and the Trilateral Contact Group play a unique role for a peaceful settlement. The OSCE deserves our full support, and Austria will do its utmost to contribute to its work, especially during our OSCE chairmanship in 2017.
All these conflicts show that 70 years after its establishment, we need the United Nations more than ever. However, in some areas the United Nations is pushed to its breaking point. It urgently needs to be reformed in order to be prepared for the future. Which is the way forward?
First, we have to remind ourselves of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The Charter is and remains our backbone. Failure is guaranteed if we do not respect it.
Secondly, we have to look at the functioning of the main bodies. We need a Security Council that is united and can act swiftly. We therefore welcome the efforts to improve the Council’s work, and we support the initiatives to suspend the use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities. In order to be able to address global challenges, we all need a United Nations that is capable of taking action and a Security Council that is more representative, accountable and transparent.
We highly value the fact that one of the headquarters of the United Nations is in Vienna, and we will continue to support it actively. We remain committed to act as a place for international dialogue, such as the Iran nuclear talks that took place in Vienna this year.
We will also continue to contribute to all diplomatic initiatives for a better world. In this sense, one key area for us is nuclear disarmament. The Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
15-29658 49/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
Nuclear Weapons last May failed to reach an agreement, but there is growing international momentum on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. At that Conference, I delivered a joint statement on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons on behalf of 159 States. And the Vienna Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons last December resulted in a humanitarian pledge, which has been endorsed by 116 States. Austria, together with other sponsors, will submit several draft resolutions on the humanitarian initiative, and we hope that they will receive broad support.
Seventy years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear weapons still pose one of the most serious threats to humankind. I can assure the Assembly that Austria will fight for a world free of nuclear weapons to make our world a safer place.
The global challenges we are facing require a strong United Nations. We therefore thank Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for all his work. I can assure the Assembly that Austria will remain committed to the United Nations and to our Secretary-General. They can continue to count on our continuous support.
"
70,2015,FIN,"Let me begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. You have the full support of Finland in your important task.
We are celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. The Charter of the United Nations was written in a world that lay in ruins after the Second World War. Today, we must face our challenges with the same determination our predecessors had in 1945. By adopting the ambitious new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) we are taking equally, or even more important steps, for humankind.
This year also marks the sixtieth anniversary of Finland’s membership of the Organization. Finland joined a family of countries that care and shoulder their responsibilities. We felt this concern when Finnish national composer Jean Sibelius passed away in 1957. The General Assembly decided to honour him with a moment of silence. The President of the Assembly at that session, Mr. Leslie Munro, described how Sibelius belonged to the whole world. We also understood what shouldering responsibility means by participating in the first United Nations peacekeeping operation in Suez.
We are now facing an extremely dangerous crisis in Syria, Iraq and parts of North Africa. We are also witnessing an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe unlike any other since the Second World War. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and its horrendous terror are a direct by-product of the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. It threatens the peace and stability of the Middle East, Africa and even Europe. We are facing a new era of migration, largely due to wars and conflict. Around 60 million refugees, the largest number since the Second World War, clearly attest to this.
The current refugee situation in the Middle East, in many parts of Africa and in the Mediterranean is unbearable for everyone. Although neighbouring countries bear the heaviest burden, the refugee crisis is causing serious political tension in Europe. Finland is also receiving a very high number of asylum-seekers. Not providing assistance is not an option for us, but we have to find more effective and sustainable ways to help those in need. Resolving the conflict in Syria and elsewhere is essential to any lasting solution. The international community must show that it cares. The Security Council and the countries in the region in particular must work together to find a political solution to the crisis in Syria. Finland welcomes all constructive efforts that pave the way for realistic, workable and lasting peace within a framework of international cooperation. Finland also remains committed to the work of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL.
The conflict in Ukraine has not been resolved, although an agreement to this end has been approved. We welcome the steps taken towards the implementation of the Minsk agreement. All illegal measures, such as the annexation of Crimea to Russia, cannot and must not be accepted.
These conflicts are not the only ones. Last year alone, there were 42 armed conflicts that resulted in approximately 180,000 fatalities. Wars and their consequences continue to threaten stability far beyond the war zone itself. United Nations peace operations are at the very heart of its efforts to maintain international peace and security, yet the scope and complexity of today’s violent conflicts have surpassed the ability of the international community to address them properly. Critical thinking, flexibility and decisive action are needed to manage and resolve those crises. The initiative to carry out major reviews of the United Nations peace and security architecture was therefore most timely.
15-29431 11/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
I very much welcome the excellent report produced by President Ramos-Horta’s High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations (A/70/357). It rightly stresses the primacy of politics; political solutions must always guide the deployment of United Nations peace operations. The United Nations prevention and mediation capacities must be strengthened and sufficiently funded. Finland is proud to have contributed to that shift of paradigm, especially by co-chairing the Group of Friends of Mediation, together with Turkey. The Group of Friends will continue its efforts to advance the recommendations of the Panel. Since the beginning of its membership, Finland has contributed 50,000 men and women to United Nations peacekeeping operations. In per capita terms, we are the second-largest contributor in Europe, and we will further increase our contribution. We will shoulder our responsibility.
Let me add that this year also marks a major success of international diplomacy — the historic agreement reach on the Iran nuclear programme. We look forward to the swift implementation by Iran of all the nuclear measures and its full engagement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve all outstanding issues.
Humankind faces the need for profound change. We cannot continue business as usual, which is a way of life transcends our planet’s boundaries and exhausts the Earth’s resources. We have all the facts at our disposal. For example, on global warming, it is up to us to act. We can choose or lose our future. I believe that we are on the right track. We have just adopted the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which has the potential to transform the world. For the very first time, we have a real programme for sustainable development binding all Member States. Now it is up to us to implement that ambitious agenda.
I urge the United Nations to once again demonstrate its convening power. We must get everybody on board to make the commitments a reality. The private sector and civil society are in a key position to take the Agenda forward, together with Governments. Even individual persons have a role to play. Another vital step in tackling global challenges is yet to take place; I refer to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December. Let us make it a success. We must care for our children and their children.
The post of the Secretary-General has been called the most impossible job in the world. Actually, it is not only a job — it is an institution of which the whole United Nations membership should feel a sense of ownership. Strong political leadership is required, especially in cases where the international community is unable to find common views. I very much welcome efforts to enhance the transparency and inclusiveness of the selection process of the next Secretary-General. As a nation that has championed gender equality throughout its 60-year United Nations membership, my country, Finland, expects to see many excellent female candidates for the position. It is high time that the other half of humankind took up that challenge.
"
70,2015,MKD,"It is my privilege to participate in the general debate in the year in which we mark the seventieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations, the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Conference, a decade and a half since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and a decade since the 2005 World Summit.
Since 1945 and the end of the devastating war that took the lives of more than 50 million people,

the United Nations, firmly committed to promoting freedom from want and fear, has established itself as a determined and driving force behind the international community and positive changes in the world. Critics of the United Nations mission say we live in a world in which conflicts in many regions are perpetuating and affecting the lives of millions while new conflicts emerge and affect the lives of millions more; a world where arms proliferation jeopardizes innocent lives and undermines economic development; a world of extreme poverty, lacking a collective will to agree on the issues affecting us all, such as climate change. We live in a world with tens of millions of refugees and displaced persons.
Despite all of that, I do not think that the United Nations has failed in its mission. On the contrary, it has resolved or mitigated difficult situations and issues that no one could handle alone, and it continues to do so. That is why we gather regularly here in New York to discuss and develop instruments that demonstrate how the United Nations can better cope with various existing and emerging challenges. The failures do not fall only on our Organization, but predominantly on Member States, due to a lack of political will, and sometimes courage, to take bold but essential decisions.
Our common efforts with regard to human rights should focus on reinforcing the system that guarantees human rights both individually and collectively. We should support endeavours aimed at ensuring the protection of human rights as the essence of the strategies and operational activities of the United Nations. What we need for the present and for the future is for the United Nations to continue to exercise its global leadership role for the benefit of mankind. In that context it is encouraging that the Member States decided to give a greater role to the General Assembly in the upcoming election of the next Secretary-General. Given the fact that no Secretary-General has ever been elected from the Group of Eastern European States, we stand firmly in support of our Group’s request in that regard.
The Republic of Macedonia remains a staunch supporter of multilateralism with the United Nations at its heart, and believes in the benefits of multilateralism to the world. It remains the core principle of our foreign policy.
While we live in an era of unprecedented technology, with immense innovations that make our lives easier and with examples of the dedication of the scientific
community, such as the work on the Ebola vaccine that brought hope and a possible cure, humankind is still confronted with issues that threaten international peace and stability. They threaten our development and prosperity, and they threaten our future.
In this ever more globalized world, where today’s news is already in the past, where no one individual is isolated from the problems of the others, we need a bold shift in our policies. To resolve problems, the policies of commitment, cooperation and wisdom should be our common choice, with a proactive approach and maximum engagement. High moral standards must be the main pillars that articulate a new world reality. In their essence they embody freedom and human rights and solidarity for humankind. The United Nations must continue with this principle in mind: to protect democracy.
Those standards must remain at the heart of our new policies today, and we must keep this solidarity in mind. That is essential. The past 70 years of United Nations experience have led us to understand that all Member States must be committed to the process of United Nations reform. The future world should be multipolar and avoid the senseless wars that have caused so many nations to suffer. We should face reality and prepare the future for the coming generations.
The region of South-East Europe is now entering a phase of positive development, and, in general, national and regional primary objectives have been fulfilled or are within reach. Despite that progress, it is clear that certain longstanding unresolved or partially resolved bilateral issues are negatively affecting our present and on our near future. The Republic of Macedonia is facing an open dispute that has become a serious obstacle to our integration in international organizations. That dispute presents an obstacle to progress in building capacity aimed at preventing breakdowns in stability in times of great global stress.
Our region faces two key strategic and global challenges. The first is the refugee and migrant crisis, and the second and more dangerous one concerns the aspirations of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) to penetrate to a greater extent into Europe, which brings with it a more serious danger to European economies and to sustainable development. Even worse, the ISIS agenda is to destroy societies that are based on universal values and principles protected by the United Nations.

Today, not just my country, but the whole of the Balkans and Europe are faced with thousands of refugees — children, women, elderly people and entire families who are fleeing the bloodshed in their home countries. Since the beginning of 2015, nearly 200,000 people, mainly Syrians, have transited through the Republic of Macedonia. Syria’s neighbours Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan are also heavily affected. The first signs of that heavy social burden are now being felt in the Balkan countries, whose economies cannot cope with the situation on their own.
For our part, we will do everything in our power to help those people who have needs and people who seek peace and cherish the hope for safe travel and for a safe and decent life. Regardless of the economic and sustainability aspects, we are trying to help them by overcoming certain weaknesses in the established system, with a strong commitment to contributing to the creation of positive solutions for the people based on their needs. However, we cannot do the job alone. The problem requires stronger engagement from the European Union in cooperation with the Balkan countries. Such a commitment would also be quite significant for the enhancement of cooperation on other practical levels.
In that manner, the challenge we face will have some positive effects. Besides helping the people in need, it will also mean significant improvements in standards in the Balkan countries and the implementation of European values and approaches through cooperation on solutions. What is also crucial — indeed the only way to resolve the refugee crisis — is for Europe to urgently address the main reason for their suffering — in this case, the Syrian conflict. The existing differences with regard to solutions must be put aside. We need unity and a concerted United Nations and Security Council position, such as, for example, that which achieved positive results in the agreement on the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons, a situation in which diplomacy accomplished a great victory.
The situation in the Middle East is growing worse. The appearance of ISIS has worsened the situation even more. The security situation, aggravated by the presence of foreign fighters, has brought a new challenge for us in dealing with religious intolerance and extreme hatred. ISIS is not a threat only to the Middle East but is a global threat to which no country is immune, especially the countries of South-East Europe, where there is a bigger risk of greater penetration by ISIS and of greater
influence on the population. Those facts can have very serious consequences, leading to the destabilization of multi-ethnic societies. That is why peace in the Middle East in particular is an issue of the utmost importance. The P5+1 agreement with Iran is a positive development for the region, since it serves as a model that could be followed for the situation in Syria.
We need to pursue a policy of prevention, which is precisely what we have been discussing in the United Nations and in our region. That is why, through the joint efforts of the United Nations in the collective security area, especially the security services within the region, we must prevent the manifestation of extremism in the region by heading off isolated conflicts or efforts to destabilize the region. Actions to repress the core ISIS forces are a positive step forward. But we must also continue to address the populations in the region, based on social inclusion and the values of the United Nations, because extremist groups target them for recruitment.
South-East Europe must tighten its security arrangements and move forward to solve outstanding questions in accordance with the principles of the United Nations. That strategic effort must be an urgent priority for the United Nations. The Republic of Macedonia remains a positive, instructive actor, seeking to make a positive contribution to good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation in ways that unite cooperation with security. This year, our country is serving as the President of the Central European Initiative, and we are focusing on promoting regional interconnections and the development of infrastructure connections.
The main strategic and foreign policy priority of the Republic of Macedonia remains our membership in the European Union and in NATO. All reforms undertaken in the country bear that goal in mind. All problems are being resolved in that spirit. Despite the challenges we face, allow me to stress that we expect no obstacles on our path to the North Atlantic community.
One unanswered question relating to the permanent stability of our region that directly influences my country and remains on the United Nations agenda is the difference we have with Greece on the name of my country, that is, the difference we have with regard to our constitutional name, the Republic of Macedonia. Resolving that issue with our neighbour is a priority that should be pursued in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions and international law, which are defined. We seek discussions on a mutually agreed solution.
6/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
Our position is clear. There is the reality that we are Macedonians, that we speak the Macedonian language and that we live in a country whose constitutional name is the Republic of Macedonia. International law must be abided by all and in all cases, not just in certain cases. That is why the decision of the International Court of Justice, handed down in favour of my country, must be respected by all Members of the Organization, precisely because the Court was founded by the United Nations and must be seen as a guarantor of the execution of the law and the bilateral agreements concluded under the auspices of the United Nations. Otherwise, trust in the United Nations will fall and sceptics who attack the validity of the Organization will gain strength.
In the 25 years since gaining independence, my country, the Republic of Macedonia, has seen a transformation of its region and of Europe. The impression has arisen, unfortunately, both in my country and elsewhere, that the United Nations is resisting dealing with our problem and is even an obstacle to progress on that and other issues in my country. Such an approach by the international community can set precedents and can, unfortunately, be easily manipulated to cause broad instability. Serious commitment is required if Greece is going to be motivated to improve its performance on the issue. Its inertia stems, at least partly, from its economic problems.
The international community’s failure to focus on my country has allowed key players to give minimum priority to the issue. As two friendly nations that, except for this issue, do not have any other problems with each other, we have to find a solution. We must respect and talk to each other and cooperate with each other in a positive spirit of friendship and cooperation with all countries in the region. My country will work towards that end, both for its own sake and for the sake of the region.
As we have done before, I would like to call upon the new Government in Greece, in the spirit of the good-neighbourly relations, to resolve this issue as neighbours, respecting the 1995 Interim Accord between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which is the cornerstone of our relations. The Accord is an agreement made under the auspices of the United Nations, and it by now should have brought about a resolution of the dispute, not its postponement. We have recently developed a new approach that should take us forward and create a positive climate
for resolving the issue. I hope that that approach will be pursued with the new Greek Government and that prejudices can be overcome.
Today’s generation of politicians should use the Accord, which was created 24 years ago as a purely political instrument and a road map. We need to move towards a commonly agreed solution supported by the citizens of both countries, which, while helping the Republic of Macedonia to move forward, will be a positive step for Greece and contribute to the positive atmosphere in the region. Such a solution will strengthen the region, so that it can deal with the challenges posed by radical elements and provide a better response to humanitarian crises.
We seek a permanent resolution of the issue, one that opens economic possibilities in the form of increased investment in our countries and the region. We must expand our ambitions to include large-scale infrastructure projects that involve the efforts of several countries and that will lead to growth in the economies of all countries in the region and the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs. Similarly, we will move forward on the strategic goal of lowering unemployment in our country, which has been a fundamental goal in my political life.
Many of us have had great economic successes in the past year. Although I may not sound humble in saying so, my country is one of the economic surprises of the past few years. We have attracted a lot of investment, including investments in large-scale projects, which has accelerated the economic progress of our citizens, developed education and improved standards in almost every sphere, which will naturally benefit the country and the region.
I would reiterate once again here, from this rostrum, as we invoke the purposes and principles of the United Nations, that it is incumbent on my country and our neighbour to the south to make full use of international law and justice so as to responsibly resolve the outstanding issue between us. As we try to overcome the issue for the sake of European values and our common future, the positions of both our countries must nevertheless be respected.
In this anniversary year, under the leadership of President Lykketoft, the General Assembly will address issues of critical importance for all of us. I would like to emphasize our support for him and wish him every success. The Republic of Macedonia will

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
continue to work together with all States Members of the United Nations to strengthen international peace and security, promote human rights and achieve the global development goals.
Finally, I would like to express our gratitude for the Secretary-General’s leadership and tireless efforts aimed at taking our Organization forward.
"
70,2015,GRC,"Seventy years have passed since the United Nations was founded, after the most disastrous war in history. In the wake of that war, the noble declarations of the United Nations raised hopes for a common peaceful future, based on universal values, social justice and respect for human rights. Much has been achieved since. But, regrettably, the vision of the founders of the Organization is far from being fulfilled.
Today we are witnessing a vast humanitarian crisis, unprecedented movements of displaced people and an increase in poverty, violence, extremism and human
24/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
rights abuses. Nevertheless, the big question for us is not to identify the challenges we face. The peoples of this world know very well what they face every day. This great Organization was established to answer the big question: how do we deal with those challenges on the basis of our shared values of the Charter of the United Nations?
Unfortunately, as the years go by, we seem to be returning not only to the same problems, but to the same old failed recipes that fostered those problems in the first place. That is why the biggest challenge we face today is an existential one: whether to continue with the same old recipes of social exclusion, political fragmentation and economic aggression, or to try to reclaim our future step by step, with confidence but also with the ability to learn from our mistakes. Allow me to refer to the efforts of my own country in confronting three specific crises in the past few years.
Like many other countries, Greece was hit hard by the 2008 economic crisis, due to the structural weaknesses of its economy and its high debt and budgetary deficits. Yet the neoliberal recipe we and other European countries were called to implement came at a devastating social cost and contributed to deepening the economic and fiscal crisis rather than curing it. We lost 25 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP), our debt to GDP ratio grew to 180 per cent, unemployment reached 27 per cent and the migration of graduates to European countries accelerated.
We faced a firm commitment on the part of some to the idea that Greece must exit the eurozone, or that the institutional and structural reforms we need must be combined with tough austerity measures and welfare and wage cuts. After many months of negotiation, Greece agreed to a new stabilization programme that includes reforms in our public administration and in the pension and tax systems and gives us the opportunity to stabilize our economy by creating the foundation for a necessary reprofiling of our debt.
Unfortunately, at the same time, it imposes measures further burdening both society and the economy. Those measures should have been avoided. We needed and still need to struggle step by step to claim a growth agenda rather than an austerity agenda, to protect the most vulnerable members of society and distribute tax burdens justly; and to link the development of the economy and the restoration of confidence to the need to restructure our debt.
How familiar does that sound to others in the Assembly? How many times since the 1970s have countries in the developed and, more recently, in the developing world struggled when facing exactly those problems — problems that concern not just their weaknesses, but the recipes they are given to deal with them? We have to realize that we need a global financial and economic system oriented to fostering national growth strategies and our post-2015 development agenda. We have to discuss the issue of debt restructuring in all competent forums, including this one, in connection with developing growth strategies, not austerity strategies.
Another regional European crisis where Greece is at the forefront is the recent unprecedented migration flows. Since the beginning of the year, more than 300,000 people, mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, have entered the country with the goal of transiting to Western European countries. Greece, like all other European countries, was taken aback by that development. Nevertheless, the people of Greece showed their solidarity by providing food and shelter to the refugees. In cooperation with the European Union and other international organizations, we are doing everything we can to manage those flows in an effective and humane way, by improving reception facilities and identification procedures, as well as by setting up hotspots to facilitate relocation.
Nevertheless, for some, the only way to deal with that challenge is to build walls higher, to repel migrants by force, or to ensure that they remain someone else’s responsibility, as far away as possible. We do not believe that the future of Europe or the future of our world can be built with ever-higher walls, or children dying at our doorstep. Neither can we forget that many of our ancestors were refugees and migrants. We cannot allow racism and xenophobia to destroy our common principles.
In the United Nations framework, we have to build the necessary mechanism for resettling people from countries neighbouring Syria, while also supporting those countries directly in hosting refugees and dismantling trafficking networks. That resettlement mechanism, together with the existing relocation mechanism in Europe, will give hope to those people, discouraging them from trusting traffickers. Furthermore, we have to increase support for frontline European States, such as Greece, in their effort to manage those flows.
15-29658 25/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
Greece is also at the centre of a third security crisis, one that causes this refugee crisis. We are at the heart of a triangle of destabilization, with Ukraine to the north and the conflicts in Libya and in the Middle East to the south-west and south-east. Located in that unstable environment, Greece has been striving to bolster regional security. It supports all efforts promoting peace and stability. Nevertheless, again we hear some who insist that we should embark on unilateral initiatives without considering their prospects and consequences, or leave the conflicts to be settled by themselves, without contributing to stabilization or reconstruction.
Yet those are exactly the mistakes that brought us here in the first place. We do not have the luxury to make foreign policy choices without examining in advance what their consequences will be. In Syria we must act decisively in favour of reconciliation and a political solution that will lay the ground for the Syrian- led democratic transition, foreseen in the Geneva Communiqué. In that regard, we support initiatives aimed at engagement with all relevant international and regional actors. In Libya, we fully support the United Nations efforts, and we welcome the successful completion of negotiations and political dialogue last week. Furthermore, we believe that the Middle East peace process is of key importance for the region. A new momentum for a solution must be promoted, with a view to the creation of a State of Palestine on the basis of the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, that coexists peacefully with Israel.
Concerning Ukraine, we support its territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders. We appreciate the efforts of the Normandy Contact Group and the conciliatory role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in avoiding a vicious circle of militarization in the region, And we call on the signatories of the Minsk agreements to implement the agreements in full.
We are also deeply concerned about the rise of jihadism, which must be dealt with decisively and comprehensively.
Beyond the crises I mentioned, Greece attaches particular importance to engagement with its immediate neighbourhood. There also it is important to foster new initiatives rather than remain trapped in the dead-ends of the past. I spoke of the need to avoid constructing walls. And truly it is shameful that for the last 41 years — the same number as my age — Cyprus
has remained divided. Today more than ever, and in light of the instability in our region, it is important that the momentum be grasped for a mutually acceptable, just, viable and comprehensive solution to the Cyprus issue, based on the relevant United Nations resolutions and on Cyprus’s membership in the European Union, to the benefit of all the people of Cyprus — Greek and Turkish Cypriots — as well as all other communities.
In that context, I would like to underline Greece’s full support for the intercommunal talks, held under the leadership of President Anastasiades and the head of the Turkish Cypriot community, Mr. Akıncı. I firmly believe that any real and lasting solution will have to eventually deal with the international issue of security, the cancellation of the anachronistic treaties of alliance and of guarantee and the withdrawal of all foreign troops, including the troops occupying the northern part of this island.
As a regional player keen on promoting security in the region, Greece has been making steady efforts to improve cooperation with Turkey. We have done so through a wide range of initiatives, including the promotion of our dialogue on confidence-building measures. Full respect for good-neighbourly relations and international law by Turkey, as well as a just and viable solution to the Cyprus issue, remain preconditions for the full normalization of Greek-Turkish relations.
In the Western Balkans, we promote robust bilateral relations and a commitment to the region’s European perspective. Greece has stepped up efforts towards the settlement of all differences in the region, among them the issue of the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We have proposed a pragmatic settlement framework aimed at reaching an agreement and an agreed set of confidence-building measures that provide us with an opportunity to further enhance bilateral cooperation and trust.
People all around the globe are striving to achieve a better future for themselves and their children. People in my country are struggling every day, with pride and dignity, to overcome crises and regain hope. Even in their most difficult moments, they are assisting those more in need, those fleeing conflict zones. Even in their most difficult moments, they are asserting their democratic right to choose their own fate. That is a daily example of people insisting, even under the most difficult conditions, on their basic humanity and democratic rights. That example should guide us in taking the necessary steps towards a safer, just and

prosperous world for ourselves and future generations to live in.
"
70,2015,PNG,"On behalf of the Government and the people of Papua New Guinea, I congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session on his election. We also pay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, Foreign Minister of Uganda, for his able leadership as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and for steering the course for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda. Furthermore, we extend our gratitude to the Secretary- General for his unfailing commitment and visionary leadership of the United Nations, thereby ensuring that the spirit of the Charter remains an enduring pillar for our collective well-being as we retool it to meet the emerging challenges and opportunities of the twenty- first century and beyond.
We commend the theme of the general debate, “The United Nations at 70: a new commitment to action”, and pledge our support to the presidency in ensuring the effective implementation of the transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) that was adopted unanimously a few days ago. As Papua New Guinea celebrates its fortieth year of nationhood, we also join the United Nations family this
year in marking the founding of the United Nations 70 years ago. My Government is committed to working in close partnership with all stakeholders to implement the post-2015 development agenda, which in turn must be nationally owned and driven.
We can succeed only when countries truly own and lead their national development plans and strategies, while integrating the 2030 Agenda. Consistent with its 2014 national strategy for responsible sustainable development, Papua New Guinea recognizes that a healthy, well-educated population is the underlying driver for development.
The principle of responsible, sustainable development means that we do not conduct ourselves in a manner that will compromise future generations. The high-level political forum must support national, regional and global efforts with respect to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and avoid issues such as those that undermined the work of the Commission on Sustainable Development. The Government of Papua New Guinea has adopted enabling national policies, strategies and plans to provide an environment conducive to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the SDGs. Those policies cover the areas of population, water and sanitation, hygiene, free basic health services and tuition-free education. The free-education policy has led to the enrolment in schools of an additional 2 million children in the past two years.
Papua New Guinea has laid a strong foundation for development in the past decade. This has resulted in unprecedented economic growth, which reached double digits in 2012. However, the current depression in international commodity prices and stock markets has negatively impacted the country’s economic performance. We are taking steps to ensure that the recent adverse conditions do not jeopardize the positive gains made in the past 10 years. Papua New Guinea is part of the global economy and, as such, seeks a stable, equitable international economic and financial architecture to support our efforts in advancing human development. The challenge for Papua New Guinea is to translate enhanced economic growth and other transformations into improved practical human development outcomes, in order to achieve our National Vision 2050. That should then result in the achievement of the SDGs.
As we gather here today, there are many conflicts worldwide, with millions of people displaced and forced
22/26 15-29876

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24
to leave their homes under risky conditions, in search of safety and security. Threats to peace and security hinder the achievement of the 2030 Agenda. Those security concerns, including transnational crime and international terrorism, if not adequately contained, will have proliferating cross-border effects on global peace, stability and economic prosperity, including for us in the Pacific Islands region. Papua New Guinea echoes the calls on all conflicting parties to amicably discuss and resolve their differences under the mandate of the Charter of the United Nations, with a view to maintaining global peace and security.
Papua New Guinea is proud to contribute to the United Nations and regional peacekeepers in South Sudan and Darfur. We hope to increase our deployment numbers as our economy grows.
The global refugee crisis has reached Papua New Guinea. We have received refugees and asylum seekers since independence. We are currently working closely with the Government of Australia by providing an asylum-seeker processing facility and contributing to finding lasting solutions to the global challenge. We strongly believe that it is high time for the global community to seriously address the root causes of the refugee situation and the forced displacement of people and families.
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons remains a serious threat to national and global peace, security and development. In that light, Papua New Guinea has prioritized policy initiatives and programmes to curb the importation and trading of firearms.
Papua New Guinea reaffirms its commitment to upholding and protecting fundamental human rights. Our national population policy 2015-2024 recognizes that human rights are closely intertwined with sustainable development.
Papua New Guinea welcomes the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. This global mechanism is essential, given the increasing frequency and severity of climate-induced natural disasters, particularly in our Pacific islands region. Recognizing the need for better preparation for timely responses to disasters and crisis situations, the Pacific subregional grouping — the Melanesian Spearhead Group — is in the process of establishing a humanitarian and emergency technical response coordination centre. We welcome technical
and capacity-building assistance from the international community to support our efforts, as provided for under international agreements, including the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway.
The world has changed since the formation of the United Nations 70 years ago. The current United Nations system requires urgent reform, and we support the efforts of the Secretary-General in that regard. On Security Council reform, we welcome the General Assembly’s recent adoption of decision 69/560, on equitable distribution and representation in the Council’s membership. Additionally, Papua New Guinea supports the initiative to review the use of the veto power in the Security Council, particularly during times of grave humanitarian crisis and mass atrocities.
In the regional context, we are fully supportive of the 2014 Pacific Islands Forum reforms, whereby a new regional development road map — the Framework for Pacific Regionalism — was adopted to promote greater regional cooperation, integration and connectivity. Through this Framework, Papua New Guinea committed $100 million for 2014-2018 to its regional outreach programme, to support Pacific SIDS in critical areas of development such as good governance, education, health, capacity-building, climate change, relief assistance and natural disaster reconstruction efforts.
Our assistance to Pacific SIDS exemplifies and promotes the spirit of South-South cooperation, and we encourage others to join us in similar partnerships. In that respect, Papua New Guinea has made modest financial contributions to Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Niue, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, as well as to various regional entities including the Pacific Islands Forum, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme and the Melanesian Spearhead Group, to add value to regional partnerships.
The Pacific region continues to attach critical importance to ensuring the sustainable development, management and conservation of the Pacific Ocean for our peoples’ livelihoods, food security and economic development. In this regard, we welcome SDG 14, on conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources. We call upon development partners to assist us in addressing various challenges related to the oceans, including illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing in our territorial waters.

Climate change poses imminent dangers with wide-ranging implications, including threats not only to human security, survival and development, but also to the entire global ecosystem. Our Climate Change Management Act is possibly the first legislation of its kind in the Pacific islands. It provides for funding arrangements to assist in the adaptation to climate change.
Along with other Pacific island States, Papua New Guinea looks forward to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris and hopes that a new comprehensive and legally binding climate agreement will be adopted to set the schedules for the reduction of carbon emissions from both the developed and developing world. The most imminent threat resulting from sea level rise due to climate change is the forced displacement of populations and complete inundation and loss of sovereign territories, particularly in Pacific small island developing States. We therefore call on the Security Council to deal decisively with the implications of climate change and security issues.
The recent Pacific Island Forum summit in Port Moresby adopted the Pacific Island Forum Leaders Declaration on Climate Change Action. Leaders were deeply concerned about the serious effects and impacts of climate change, particularly on national and regional development and security issues. Among other things, the Pacific island leaders declared that an increase of 1.5°C would severely exacerbate the particular challenges facing the most vulnerable smaller island States of the Pacific and urged that all efforts be made to keep us within the global temperature goal, as noted by the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC at its twentieth session, in its decision 1/CP.20.
The 2015 Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Declaration on Climate Change Action also expresses an expectation that there will be access to financial resources for climate change actions and resilience in vulnerable developing countries; recognition of the special circumstances and vulnerability of SIDS, particularly those in the Pacific, and the least developed countries (LDCs); support for inclusion in the Paris outcome document of loss and damage as a critical and stand-alone element, building on the ongoing work of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage; and finally, recognition of impacts of climate change on women and youth, the
elderly, the disabled, indigenous peoples and other vulnerable and marginalized groups, acknowledging their contributions to effective implementation of the Paris outcome document.
Let us not leave anyone — particularly those of us in SIDS and LDCs — behind, drowning. We must strive to come together in accordance with the rule of law for a better, more secure and prosperous world.
"
70,2015,OMN,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, and your country, the Kingdom of Denmark, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. We trust that your diplomatic experience will greatly impact the success of this session. We are ready to work with you, Sir, and all the delegations of Member States so as to accomplish our goals and objectives, particularly in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the achievement of sustainable development.
We are also pleased to express our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the friendly Republic of Uganda, for his able stewardship of the Assembly at the previous session. I would also like to take this opportunity pay tribute once again to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts to improve the work of the Organization in order to meet the aspirations of all Member States.
This session coincides with the seventieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations. The occasion represents an opportunity to renew our confidence in joint international action through the adoption of positive initiatives that could contribute to
the creation of an international economic order based on justice for all States and nations.
Since the dawn of the Omani renaissance on 23 July 1970, we in the Sultanate of Oman have embraced peace and dialogue as basic principles. That is because we are convinced that dialogue is the most logical foundation upon which all forms of conflict can be resolved. Throughout the history of the United Nations, humankind has sought to strengthen confidence through agreed and conciliatory ideas and the principles of the United Nations Charter, which help to deepen and widen common interests and mutual benefits. We also believe that dialogue is a peaceful means of settling disputes, and its use is preferable to resorting to confrontation and conflict.
From that perspective, my country welcomed the agreement reached between the P5+1 and the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran on the Iranian nuclear programme. Despite the fact that that breakthrough took great effort and a considerable amount of time, it can serve as a model for solving controversial and complicated issues among countries through dialogue, negotiation and the balancing of international interests. We hope that that historic agreement will have a positive impact on regional and international peace and security and pave the way for a new era of relations based on cooperation, respect and mutual trust.
The raising of the flag of the State of Palestine as an observer State at the United Nations, though a symbolic gesture, reminds us of the tragedy of the Palestinian people and their aspirations to attain fulfilment of their legitimate rights. We call on the Palestinians and the Israelis alike to return to the negotiating table and work on achieving the vision of two independent States living side by side, through steps that would secure the interests of both parties, based on the pillars of the Arab Peace Initiative and the relevant United Nations resolutions. We also call upon the United Nations and the parties sponsoring the peace process in the Middle East to make greater efforts to reach an agreement for the settlement of the crisis, instead of merely to managing it.
My country also follows with great concern the developments in the crisis in the brotherly Republic of Yemen, which has resulted in disastrous humanitarian tragedies. While we understand the circumstances that provoked the crisis, we continue to believe that the political parties in Yemen are capable of restoring security and stability to the country. We are deeply
15-29946 3/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
concerned that the continuation of violence in Yemen has enabled several terrorist organizations, including those on United Nations watch lists, to use Yemen as a base for their terrorist activities. That poses a direct threat to the region’s security and stability.
We call upon all political forces in Yemen to support the efforts of the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, to contribute to the restoration of peace and stability in the Republic of Yemen and to enable the achievement of the aspirations of the brotherly Yemeni people to a safe and dignified life. My country also expresses its strong condemnation of the targeting of diplomatic and consular premises in Yemen’s capital, Sana’a. We call on all parties to respect the rules of international law and refrain from any acts that violate their international obligations, particularly those set forth in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963.
As the Syrian crisis has now entered its fifth year, the Syrian people continue to suffer; hundreds of thousands have left their homes and risked their lives in circumstances unprecedented in modern history. We call upon all Syrian parties and neighbouring countries to support the mission of the Secretary- General’s Special Envoy, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, to restore security and stability to that brotherly country and contribute to the eradication of the terrorism that has been able to find a foothold in Syria and currently poses a threat to regional and international security. My country reiterates its firm and uncompromising stance in condemning all forms of terrorism, without regard to their causes and motivations.
While we commend the humanitarian efforts by countries and regional and international organizations to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people, we appeal to the international community to do even more to protect the brotherly Syrian people at home and abroad. In that respect, we would like to emphasize the continuation of the humanitarian programme offered by the Sultanate of Oman to help Syrian refugees.
My country stresses the importance of maintaining the universality of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. That can be achieved only by strengthening the three pillars of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), namely, nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In that context, we call upon the sponsors of
the Treaty to fully implement the resolution of the 1995 NPT Review Conference on making the Middle East a region free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. That would help safeguard the credibility and universality of that important treaty.
Resolution 55/2, containing the Millennium Declaration, is considered an important document, as it sets forth an ambitious international programme to assist countries achieve high levels of economic and social development. However, the weakness of the global economy over the past 20 years has had serious social repercussions, including an increase in number of unemployed, which has crippled the ability of many countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Bearing that in mind, we call upon the international community to put the issues of the economy, trade and the environment at the forefront of the urgent issues that need to be addressed. The first and foremost of those issues is the international energy trade, since it is crucial that the international trade in energy, specifically the price of oil and its by-products, be properly organized.
My country looks forward to the convening of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris. We hope that participating countries can agree on a balanced international programme that takes into account the concerns and interests of all developing and developed countries.
We are facing real challenges that we must tackle resolutely if we are to ensure that we are not hindering development but encouraging it in a way that helps us to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We therefore believe that the next phase of joint international action requires that the members of the international community expand their concept of genuine partnership and shared destiny. We hope that this session succeeds and that the goals of the United Nations will be accomplished.
"
70,2015,MLI,"On behalf of the Malian delegation, I would first like to warmly congratulate the President on his accession to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. There can be no doubt that his election on 15 June not only recognized his qualities as an experienced diplomat but was also a tribute to his country, the Kingdom of Denmark, which has an excellent relationship with my country that is cooperative in every way. I would like to assure him that my delegation is completely at his disposal in his efforts to achieve full success for his mandate.
I would also like to express our great appreciation to his predecessor, our brother Mr. Sam Kutesa of Uganda, for his outstanding and effective conduct of the work of the preceding session. In the same spirit, I would like to pay tribute to Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the eighth Secretary-General, for his dedication and unwavering commitment to peace and security.
Before going any further, I, like others before me, would like to salute the memory of the victims of the disaster in Mina, Saudi Arabia, from Mali and other countries in the Islamic community. In these tragic circumstances, on behalf of the people of Mali, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and wish the injured a speedy recovery.
We sometimes see coincidences in the history of peoples and institutions. One such is the symbolism of today’s date, 28 September 2015, which marks the fifty-fifth anniversary of the admission of my country, Mali, into the United Nations, pursuant to resolution 1491 (XV), adopted by the Assembly at its fifteenth session, and for that I would like to express my profound gratitude to the Republic of Tunisia and to Sri Lanka, known then as Ceylon, under the leadership of Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
Between 28 September 1960 and today, successive Governments of Mali have spared no effort to fashion a better world, free of the spectres of conflict and war, whose main victims are women, children and the elderly. Coming as I do from Mali, I know of what I speak. In its continuing quest for peace, the Government of Mali, under my authority, has always preferred the path of dialogue to the language of arms in the multidimensional crisis that we are in the
process of resolving. In that regard, the Government of Mali has always complied with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the decisions and recommendations of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Non-Aligned Movement.
It was as part of that dynamic that I took the initiative to engage my Government in the inter-Malian negotiations in Algiers, supported by international mediation that included representatives of the United Nations, under the auspices of Algeria. I am happy to be able to commend here the personal commitment of Algeria’s President, our big brother Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika. After eight months of discussion with our brothers in the north who had taken up arms, I am particularly pleased to present the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali. Arriving at the Agreement through the Algiers process has been difficult, but it is done. While not a panacea and not without problems, the Agreement gives us a general framework within which we can work towards a lasting and sustainable peace.
This consensus peace Agreement, which can serve as a general framework for every Malian party in every aspect of life, is the first in Mali’s history. It represents a new social pact for Mali and Malians, and a new collective commitment to peace and concord in our country. The Agreement has just sealed forever the reunion of the children of Mali. It is the result of the will of all the Malian parties and the commitment of all involved to reaching the stage we are now in, that of implementing the Agreement. For us it is a balanced compromise that takes into consideration all our essential and legitimate concerns, including the issues of Mali’s territorial integrity, national sovereignty and balanced development of every region of the country. That is what is most important to us and is what the Agreement grants and guarantees us.
I would also like to express to all those here today my country’s commitment and to give our thanks for everyone’s assistance. Few countries in recent years have been on the receiving end of such assistance as has Mali in this stage of its national reconstruction. That is why we will not drag our feet. We have our Agreement, and we have now created its implementation framework, the Comité de suivi de l’accord, put together immediately after the signing of the Agreement, which has already got down to work. We have taken measures
15-29425 19/34

A/70/PV.15 28/09/2015
to build confidence among all our citizens and to assure them of our unflagging commitment to implementing peace and build a new Mali. Without peace, we cannot succeed. We were elected by the people of Mali, despite the grave crisis we have endured, specifically to rebuild our country.
I would also like to say that the people of Mali hope to be supported in this implementation phase of the Agreement for Peace. Implementing a peace agreement is a delicate business, and it needs support. That is why we have scheduled a conference in Paris on 22 October to raise funds for the development of Mali. God willing, we will hold the conference and, hopefully, many of our friends here today who have helped us so much will come.
For its part, the Government of Mali has developed and submitted to the Comité de suivi a comprehensive action plan for implementing the Agreement and an emergency plan for the interim period. I should stress that the Comité de suivi has warmly welcomed that approach. However, it is worth pointing out that signing the Agreement is not an end in itself but requires that we pool all of our efforts to implement it, and that is a major challenge that we can rise to, God willing. That is why I repeat my call to come to the conference in Paris on 22 October.
The Government of Mali reiterates its call to all signatory parties to the Agreement as well as the international community to pool their efforts and information to expel from the Sahel and Mali’s national territory our common enemy, namely, terrorist groups and narco-jihadists who seek only to satisfy their criminal appetites by means of fear and terror.
I welcome the adoption of Security Council resolution 2227 (2015), which renewed for the third time the mandate of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, whose remarkable work accomplished to date I salute. I assure the Mission of my support and assistance for the success of our shared mission. On the same note, I want to express the gratitude of the Government of Mali for the international mediation led by Algeria, which included the United Nations, the African Union, ECOWAS, the European Union, the OIC, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, the Niger, Nigeria and Chad. I do not think I have left anyone out.
I also welcome the role and the decisive contribution of France in Mali and all the sacrifices made in this
regard. I also welcome the equally important role of the United States of America in the peace process. To all the friendly nations and the international partner organizations that have expressed solidarity vis-à-vis Mali by sending us their children or their experts to defend the values that form the basis of our humanity, I renew here the sincere thanks of the Malian people. I bow reverently — very piously — to the memory of all victims, civilian and military, Malian or foreign, fallen on the field of honour in Mali for the defence of human dignity, freedom and democracy.
I salute and thank UNESCO, under the leadership of our friend Irina Bokova, for the remarkable work accomplished to preserve the cultural heritage in our closed, revered city of Timbuktu. The fate suffered by the mausoleums, which modern-day barbarians consigned to collective memory, is well known. What we saw happen in Palmyra had occurred earlier in Mali, together with the terror that the International Criminal Court (ICC) has begun to address. We welcome the recent decision by the ICC on this new crime.
When representatives of 50 nations signed the Charter of the United Nations in San Francisco on 26 June 1945 and when Charter entered into force on 24 October 1945, many States here today had not yet attained independence. We are pleased that, 70 years later, the United Nations now has 193 Members, all committed to preserving the ideals of San Francisco, based on the three pillars of peace and security, development and human rights. That is why the delegation of the Republic of Mali, which I have the honour to lead, is pleased with the General Assembly’s extremely appropriate decision to make the theme of the general debate “The United Nations at 70 — a new commitment to action”.
This theme, the choice of which is of proven relevance, will undoubtedly permit all world leaders and lovers of peace, freedom and justice to make an objective assessment of the progress the Organization has made and to consider the future with a critical eye trained on the difficulties encountered in the past, particularly in areas where the United Nations and the international community are called upon to make greater efforts to meet current and future challenges.
At this time of reckoning, we welcome the important progress made in implementing the provisions of Chapter VI of the Charter on the pacific settlement of disputes through negotiation, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, all of
20/34 15-29425

28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15
which have resulted in the prevention, management, maintenance and consolidation of peace in the world. We also welcome the significant progress achieved in the processes of decolonization, disarmament and the promotion of human rights. Indeed, we appreciate the true value of building agreements under Chapter VIII of the Charter, in particular between the Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council.
While these successes show the ongoing relevance of certain principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, we must recognize that their implementation has been made possible thanks to the political will of Member States and the effectiveness of the staff of the United Nations system, including peacekeepers, who work tirelessly, under Chapter VII to bring about a better world. I wish to express to all of them the deep gratitude of the Government and the people of Mali.
In a constantly changing world, the United Nations is required to adapt to new challenges. Part of the latest dynamic will be the implementation of post-2015 development agenda, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, which we recently adopted (resolution 70/1).
A perfect example of a country of the Sahel, my country, Mali, has suffered the brunt of the effects of climate change because of the fragility of its natural ecosystem. The accretion of sand, the drying up of the Niger River, and the degradation of the soil and vegetation cover with unsuspected consequences are prime illustrations of what we have had to confront. Therefore, the Government and the people of Mali strongly hope that the conclusions of twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December, will lead to the conclusion of a legally binding agreement for the preservation of what remains of our environment.
In addition to this major challenge, there is the need to promote global economic governance and the financing of development. The results of the third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa in July 2015, offer hope in terms of mobilizing the international community to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, consistent with the Monterrey Consensus of 2002 and the Doha Declaration of 2008.
As a landlocked developing country and among the least developed countries, Mali welcomes debt relief
for heavily indebted poor countries and commends the countries that have achieved or even exceeded the target threshold of setting aside 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product for public aid. That is indeed to be welcomed. In this regard, I reaffirm from this rostrum the recognition of my Government of all the generous donors who, in May 2013 in Brussels, were willing to commit to the economic recovery of Mali, through pledges totalling €3.5 billion. I would also like to take this opportunity to call on countries that have not yet done so to keep their commitments with a view to the effective mobilization of the pledged sums, because sometimes the distance between the cup and the lip is great.
With respect to the sources of innovative financing, the Government of Mali supports and strongly encourages the UNITLIFE initiative based on the simple principle of assigning a tiny part of the immense wealth created by the use and exploitation of extractive resources in Africa to the fight against malnutrition, so that the globalization of solidarity responds to the globalization of the economy. Through this initiative, the Government of Mali plans to collect a percentage of the revenues from mining, especially gold, for the purposes of investing the funds in the fight against malnutrition in our county, because that will free up opportunities for tomorrow. Malnutrition affects our most vulnerable groups, including the one that will bear the future — our young people — with all the evils that it can cause, in particular cretinism, which no one should wish to have, just when we need to have qualified, fit-for-purpose human resources.
One of the greatest challenges in the world today concerns international migration, a phenomenon whose alarming growth can be attributed to poverty, natural disasters, man-made catastrophe and, I am sorry to say, the cynicism of organized criminals, because criminality certainly exists. The evidence lies in the tens of thousands who are willing to lose their lives through illegal migration in the sands of the desert and the depths of the ocean, as we are seeing today in the Mediterranean.
The comprehensive approach that the delegation of Mali proposes depends on intensifying the dialogue among countries of origin, transit and destination in order to find appropriate solutions capable of connecting the requirements of security, development, respect for human dignity and solidarity, which are in fact a single package. If we achieve this, migration will take place in
15-29425 21/34

A/70/PV.15 28/09/2015
a humane and orderly fashion, benefiting migrants and the countries of origin and destination.
With respect to security, the United Nations now needs to strengthen its tools and mechanisms with a view to creating a genuine response to the new threats of violent terrorism, drug-trafficking and related crimes. Despite the inroads we have made in the area of peace and security, it is regrettable that the international arena continues to to be characterized by the increasing violence perpetrated or masterminded by terrorist groups and narco-jihadists such as Ansar Dine, the Mouvement pour l’unicité et le jihad en Afrique de l’Ouest, Al-Mourabitoun, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Al-Qaida, Al-Shabaab, and Boko Haram, which is now known as the Islamic State in Western Africa.
It is clearly urgent to bridge the gap between security challenges and the United Nations peacekeeping doctrine. We should not forget that this doctrine was designed 60 years ago. I wish from this rostrum to reaffirm Mali’s active support for any initiative to reform the peacekeeping architecture by incorporating that new reality, because no country today can ignore the fact that terrorism has become a threat to international peace and security.
Mali supports all initiatives for peace in the Middle East, especially any initiative that would enable the people of the region, especially the people of Palestine, to finally enjoy lasting and just peace through the two- State solution, which was adopted long ago and should finally be realized.
The Government of Mali also welcomes the restoration of normal diplomatic between Cuba and the United States of America. I commend the efforts, courage and political realism of President Barack Obama and President Raúl Castro Ruz, as well as of Pope Francis. Pope Francis is a man of peace and a man of heart, as he showed last Friday when he addressed the nations of the world from this very rostrum (see A/70/PV.3). He played a very important role in the normalization of relations between Cuba and the United States, and I commend him for that.
Clearly, our Organization has its work cut out for it. If it did not exist, it would surely have to be created.
Reform of the Security Council is another major topic of discussion. Security Council reform will
certainly be one of the most cross-cutting goals of our seventieth session. Mali supports the African Common Position, as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. We will continue to consult with other regional groups in order to forge the requisite political will to correct the historical injustice to which the continent of Africa continues to be subjected by virtue of its lack of representation as a permanent member and its underrepresentation as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. That is not normal and not right in the case of such an important continent — a continent of the future, as the whole world is well aware.
United Nations reform should also include global economic governance in order to make the international financial institutions better able to assist the nations of the South to address the challenges of underdevelopment. In that regard, I urgently call on Member States, regional groups and the international community to tirelessly pursue the constructive dialogue that has been under way since 2009 so that United Nations reform can finally be achieved. Indeed, the amendments to Articles 23, 27, 61 and 109 of the Charter of the United Nations, which entered into force between 1965 and 1968, are sufficient proof that reform of the United Nations is far from being a Pandora’s box to be feared.
We must therefore embark on reform with boldness and good will. Indeed, reform will allow the decision-making bodies of the Organization to reflect its geographical balance and to improve working conditions, including the relationship between the Security Council and the General Assembly. A reformed United Nations would gain credibility in the eyes of international public opinion and its decisions would have a greater chance of being accepted and implemented.
To conclude, I reiterate the full commitment of the people of Mali to the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations, especially the preservation of future generations from the scourge of war."
70,2015,PLW,"On behalf of President Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., President of the Republic of Palau, I have the honour to make the following remarks before the General Assembly at its seventieth session.
At the outset, Palau would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to lead our work during the seventieth session. We pledge our support for the work ahead. May we also take the opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his sterling leadership during the sixty-ninth session.
We meet here today in perilously challenging, yet still hopeful, times. The principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are more critical to our common future than ever before. We must not only reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, but also redouble our efforts to uphold those rights. Our collective determination to promote social progress and better standards of living must be matched by our on-the-ground partnerships to fight poverty, protect the most vulnerable among us and protect the one planet we call home.
So while the challenges — violence and war, poverty and disease, rising seas and wildfires as well as droughts caused by climate change — are enormous, so too is the resolve that I share with all here today to make good on our commitment to transforming our world through the urgent and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).
I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General, the co-facilitators and the thousands of people whose dedicated work made the Sustainable Development Goals in the 2030 Agenda a strong set of imperatives for transformational change that all of our peoples so urgently need to preserve our cultures, our economies and our environment and to ensure a sustainable and prosperous future for our children.
Let me also briefly express my President’s sorrow at the plight of the countless refugees who are seeking havens of peace and prosperity for themselves and for their families as they search for refuge and protection away from their motherlands, which have been torn by strife that was sparked and worsened by internal conflict and/or environmental degradation and climate change.
The theme of the general debate at the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, “The United Nations at 70: a new commitment to action”, is very appropriate for this year’s high-level event, the United Nations Summit for the adoption of the new post- 2015 development agenda. It took place just before the
24/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
general debate and adopted resolution 70/1, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, containing the Sustainable Development Goals.
Just prior to the Summit, His Holiness Pope Francis addressed the General Assembly (see A/70/PV.3), reiterating the theme of his papal encyclical, Laudato si’, wherein he criticized the careless use of our planet’s resources leading to environmental degradation and global warming. Let his commentaries serve as an inspiration to us all that will change hearts, minds and actions for a better future that will focus the world’s attention on the most vulnerable among us and on our Mother Earth.
My friends, we can only hope that a generation from now, this session of the General Assembly will be remembered as the defining event when the nations of the world decided, with the greatest resolve, to reverse the tide of the unchecked development and exploitation of our planet and redouble their efforts to end poverty and protect the most vulnerable among us and truly committed to transformative action.
Fifteen years ago, 189 nations and 23 international organizations committed to moving forward with the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Goals served as the framework for a new global commitment to reducing extreme poverty, improving health, enhancing environmental sustainability and addressing gender equality. We now know that progress towards achieving these Goals has been impressive but uneven. Our work to augment these Goals and adopt a new set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals reflects a very clear recognition that the results of the MDGs would have been more impressive had they addressed the underlying causes of poverty and environmental degradation, and had Goal 8, on partnerships, been better realized.
Through 15 years of experience, we now recognize that it is only through international cooperation and partnership with a wide variety of stakeholders that we can scale up the urgent action needed to realize the full potential of sustainable development for our people and for the oceans, forests and coastal areas that sustain our cultures and livelihoods. I am hopeful that now, in 2015, we will all embrace the overarching goal represented by the new Sustainable Development Goals, that is, our commitment to revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development.
The third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa in July, was the first test of the degree of commitment on the part of the developed countries to endowing the new sustainable development agenda with the means needed to meet the new proposed level of ambition. Unfortunately, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda merely reiterated, by and large, the commitments made to the outgoing agenda of the Millennium Development Goals and failed to bridge the gap between grand speech-making and down-to- earth expanded financial commitments.
A more ambitious and reinvigorated global partnership is clearly required. The annual report of the MDG Gap Task Force, including the recently released 2015 report, highlighted several shortfalls in international efforts to achieve the MDGs and provided sobering reminders of the need to substantially step up efforts to meet long-standing international commitments.
Over four and a half decades ago, the international community committed to transferring 0.7 per cent of the gross national income of the rich countries to the poorer countries in the form of official development assistance. To date, the rich nations of the world have generally fallen short of that commitment. In the coming decades, affordable and equitable access to technology will be ever more critical if we are to attain the designated levels of human progress and sustainable development in many areas, including enhancing food security, improving health, including mental health and well-being, and preventing non-communicable diseases. Technology will be the bedrock for aggressive action in climate-change mitigation and adaptation, which remain urgent.
Let me reiterate an important point. If our collective will to implement the 2030 Agenda is sincere, then it is essential to greatly enhance the means and mechanisms of implementation on a much greater scale than those recommended in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. That is the only way to achieve the promise of a more inclusive and sustainable world free from hunger and where poverty is eradicated. Let me say it again. That will be achieved only through expanded, genuine and durable partnerships.
Fortunately, my country has a history of strong partnerships. The United States continues to support Palau in its development and movement toward economic independence. We continue to be strong friends, and
15-29946 25/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
we recognize the unique relationship that we share. We look forward to completing our Compact of Free Association agreement with the United States, which reflects that close and special relationship. We wish to express our special gratitude to the United States and our many other global partners for their support of Goal 14, on oceans, and for the ongoing support towards the preservation of our largest global resource through the set-aside of 10 per cent of our global oceans as marine protected areas. Finally, we thank the United States for its continued and increased assistance to Palau’s expanded marine surveillance and enforcement efforts. That is critical if we are to successfully protect the proposed new Palau National Marine Sanctuary.
Palau would also like to acknowledge the great friendship that it has with Japan and the very significant economic support that we have received from Japan over the years. We also wish to express our sincere gratitude for Japan’s generous support and enhanced public and private assistance to our marine surveillance and enforcement efforts. We continue to express our support for the expansion and reform of the Security Council and for Japan’s permanent membership in the Council.
Palau would also like to thank the Republic of China on Taiwan for its friendship and economic support in assisting Palau to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Palau also wishes to recognize Taiwan’s commitment to lowering carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2050, compared to 2005 levels. We urge the United Nations system to involve Taiwan in the process of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Additionally, we advocate in favour of Taiwan’s participation in the relevant international environmental mechanisms, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Taiwan possesses technical capacities in many areas that can be shared with the world. It should therefore also participate in other international meetings, mechanisms and frameworks such as the World Health Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, among others.
The success and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals will rest, in great part, on the strength of partnerships, which means inclusion rather than exclusion. Taiwan has been a valuable partner to Palau in achieving our MDGs, and we look forward
to our continued partnership with that country as we embark upon the great challenge of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
We would like to express our special gratitude to India for its recent efforts to expand relations with the Pacific Community and to enhance regional cooperation aimed at achieving mutual goals of environmental recovery and economic development. Palau reiterates its support for the reform of the Security Council so as to allow the Council to reflect more closely the issues of today’s world, including the security needs and concerns of the Asia-Pacific region. In that respect, expanding the permanent membership category to include India would be welcome.
Finally, we would like also to recognize the very broad list of partners across the globe that make our efforts towards a sustainable future possible, including the Governments of Australia and New Zealand and the European Union, private organizations, non-governmental organizations and civil society.
With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we have reaffirmed the commitment enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations to fundamental human rights. Inherent in that commitment is an obligation to provide appropriate support for the realization of that commitment. As my President often says, at the end of the day the success of the 2030 Agenda will depend on the strength of the partnerships we develop.
It is now time for the world community to develop those partnerships and, through them, to commit to a much expanded and more accessible financing, technology and human-resource capacity. We must now match our collective determination to promote social progress and better standards of living with on-the-ground partnerships to fight poverty, protect the most vulnerable among us and protect the one planet that we call home.
"
70,2015,LCA,"As I address this historic seventieth session of the General Assembly, I join in the chorus of congratulations to the President on assuming the high honour and Office of President of the General Assembly. Please permit me to take this opportunity to wish him a successful tenure, which I am sure will be guaranteed by his experience as Speaker of the Parliament of Denmark.
It has been 70 years since this great vessel of peace took flight following the atomic destruction of the Second World War. At that time, people throughout the planet were of one mind that the pursuit of peace was the supreme objective. For 70 years we have grappled with our mission in the midst of war and conflict and sometimes we have even questioned our effectiveness.
For 70 years we have been coming to the General Assembly to deliver statements of glorious intention, only to be disappointed by inaction or adverse decisions. After 70 years the time has come to confront our collective conscience and reconcile our words with our actions. As we subject ourselves and the global Organization to new levels of critical examination we must answer the question: are we still on course to securing a world of peace or are we evading the urgent
26/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
course of duty which calls upon us to act with wisdom, humility and love for humankind?
We must also focus on what we have achieved and the work that we need to do, now and in the future. As we engage in this process of introspection and reflection, we must seize the opportunity for rededication and regeneration for the United Nations to continue addressing the increasingly complex issues of human survival.
The President has assumed office at a time of tremendous trial for many people throughout the world. Today many of our Middle Eastern brothers and sisters in Iraq, Libya, Syria and elsewhere find their lives transformed by graphic experiences of disturbance, personal trauma and, in some instances, much physical and mental pain. That is a human tragedy of unthinkable proportions, and the people of Saint Lucia and other small countries look on in near disbelief at the huge exodus of people from those previously prosperous countries.
Suddenly, the leaders and peoples of the European countries to which those migrants on the move have sought refuge find themselves gripped by surprise and concern as they search to find the correct reaction to this humanitarian crisis. We can well understand the dilemma faced by receiving countries, which have to balance their particular national interests against their wider global responsibility. They know that the more new immigrants they accept, the more they will have to accept as others desperate to escape those situations of suffering and trauma flock to friendlier fraternal nations.
We note that this huge migration flow is towards Europe, some of whose countries border or face the Middle East zone. Although we are geographically far away from the crisis, the human suffering burns our collective Caribbean heart. And even as we see the inevitability of Europe’s responsibility to bear the brunt of this tragedy, we recognize the long history of the interplay between Europe and the Middle East.
As we see and hear some in Europe express concern about the magnitude of the challenge, we want to encourage and assure them that the right thing can and must be done. Smaller and poorer nations have demonstrated a humanity and generosity that has made a big difference whenever and wherever they assisted.
In the Caribbean we offer the example of Cuba, which despite being saddled with a United States economic embargo for more than 50 years has been able to provide scholarships to train thousands of professionals from the Caribbean and Latin America every year. In addition, Cuba’s support in combating various medical epidemics throughout the world, including the recent Ebola crisis in Africa, has been exemplary and legendary. Therefore Europe, despite the magnitude of the challenge, as a group of powerful countries can respond effectively within the framework of its integrated whole and be comforted and inspired by the example of Cuba.
As a global community our interests cannot be served in the morbid scenario of conflict and war. It is in that context that Saint Lucia extends commendation to both the United States Administration and the Government of Iran for working out a diplomatic solution that will manage the nuclear threat in the region for the next 15 years. That is certainly in keeping with the peacebuilding mission of the United Nations. This approach will not only lead to a general lessening of tension but may set the stage for the West and the Middle East to work out a rational and convincing strategy to tackle the root causes of conflict in that area, thereby re-establishing peace and tranquillity in that part of the world.
In that connection, Saint Lucia appeals for a similar approach to the continuing Israeli/Palestinian conflict, one that will result in the resolution of that longstanding issue. In our seventieth year, we must assert the supremacy of international law and diplomacy. Resolution 181, of 29 November 1947, calls for the establishment of both the State of Israel and that of Palestine. My country reiterates its call for the recognition of the statehood of Palestine and its full membership of the Organization.
Clearly, a powerful byproduct of conflict and war is the displacement of people — physically, socially and economically. Nonetheless, Saint Lucia and other small States expect that present events will reinforce the notion that we now live in one world where your troubles are mine and my troubles are yours, and that there will be a greater concern to have problems resolved through genuine diplomatic engagement rather than through the force of power.
Countries like my own are acutely aware that the problems of others far away throughout the world can
15-29822 27/29

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
easily wash on to our shores. We are very mindful, therefore, that even when we do not feel directly impacted there is the very real possibility that the consequences may spill over into our region. We have often experienced that through the volatile prices of oil and petroleum products. It has also been spurred by political turmoil and financial disturbances in far off regions but which often have a substantial impact upon our own plans for development and economic progress. The theatre of war is also present in our region.
From an economic perspective, small States like Saint Lucia are literally terrorized by the constant attacks of the rich and powerful on any economic advances by the poor and powerless, which place our future in persistent peril. How can we be expected to be stable and secure if our vulnerabilities as small island developing States are constantly ignored and overlooked? How is our war on poverty supposed to succeed and be sustained if at every turn it is systematically undermined by the regressive imposition of policies by the international community, whether in the form of illogical economic graduation, insensitive erosion of trade preferences or inexplicable black listing of our financial jurisdictions?
This geographic and economic insecurity has become the central source of domestic instability. To increase the specific gravity of our economic problems, from an environmental standpoint small States like Saint Lucia face growing insecurity as climate change unleashes increasingly deadly and destructive disasters upon us. We are now all aware of the recent devastation of Dominica by Tropical Storm Erika, which caused damage amounting to almost 100 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP). As I speak now, Joaquin continues its decimating march across the economic and environmental fabric of the Bahamas. These two most recent examples, only weeks apart, are vivid testimony to the ferocity of the threats that confront us.
In addition, small States like my own find ourselves today trapped in a situation where the erosion of trade preferences and a decline in official development assistance and foreign direct investment have caused us to engage in increased borrowing to meet our current social and economic obligations resulting in high debt to GDP ratios. That has narrowed the room for fiscal policy flexibility and fiscal manoeuvring. This is further compounded by the increased security costs of responding to the negative impacts of the illicit
trade in small arms and illegal narcotics, as well as reconstruction costs following natural disasters.
The new global partnership for sustainable economic and social development provides a platform from which to tackle human security in all its facets. We firmly support the international community consistently working to minimize the causes of global and regional insecurity.
In that vein, 2015 provides a once-in-a-generation opportunity to set a transformational global agenda for sustainable development. The quartet of global agreements forged towards that end — on disaster risk reduction, financing for development, the post- 2015 development agenda and the new climate change agreement yet to be finalized — are intended to usher in a new era of sustainable development for all. The adoption of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals suggests that we have progressed our understanding of the profound challenges that face developing countries. However, the economic, social and environmental security of small island developing States like my own rests in the effective implementation of these agreements.
Small countries like Saint Lucia can hardly withstand externally induced insecurity. We require for our development a context of regional and international harmony, which is dependent on linkages far from our immediate environments. So there is substantial concern that small States with limited material or diplomatic outreach do not have access to arrangements that allow them to speedily draw support from outside to inhibit or minimize environmental insecurity.
The major countries of the globe, and indeed the members of the Security Council, would no doubt be sensitive to the issues of insecurity. But what small countries have always known, and larger Powers are now beginning to recognize, is that harmful events in particular sections of the globe have the potential to affect and draw in all of us as members of today’s integrated global system.
Saint Lucia maintains its position that expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership of the Security Council is imperative to better reflect the contemporary world realities and achieve a more accountable, representative, transparent — and more important— relevant Security Council. We applaud what we have achieved during the past year by moving the process now to text-based
28/29 15-29822

negotiations, and look forward to the realization of that process.
In Saint Lucia, and in the other members of the Western Hemisphere, there is a general sense of relief and welcome at the diplomatic reconciliation that has been taking place between the United States and the Republic of Cuba. The Government of Saint Lucia believes that this initiative opens the way to a full-scale reconciliation of hemispheric relations. It removes unnecessary impediments to our efforts at regional and hemispheric cooperation. It consolidates the channels that are necessary for pursuing viable paths of regional economic integration, and it allows small countries like Saint Lucia to utilize the scale of the regional platform to initiate plans and processes that can be mutually beneficial in the Caribbean region and in the hemisphere as a whole.
Furthermore, it is another indication of the removal of situations and stratagems that serve only to create sources of insecurity. We are firmly of the view that countries in our hemisphere committed to this perspective now have an opportunity, on the basis of the initiative taken by Pope Francis and by the President of the United States of America, to promote the path of peaceful resolution of disputes in full awareness of the fact that national or regional conflicts are inhibitors to persistent economic growth and therefore social stability.
The normalization of relations within our hemisphere is also an indication that old conflicts and disputes kept frigid by the era of the Cold War, are giving way to new avenues of cooperation and collaboration among countries. In addition, the post-world-war period has begun to give way to new arrangements or efforts at reconciliation that permit peaceful relations in various parts of the world.
The Government of Saint Lucia, which has official relations with the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan, notes the continuing interchange between that State and the People’s Republic of China, which is defined in particular by the economic relations in
which they are mutually involved. We believe that as we retain the status quo of accrediting recognition to Taiwan, it is not for us but for themselves to indicate the appropriate template in the relations between the two countries.
As I prepare to bring my presentation to its logical conclusion, I want to return to a reflective mode on the 70 years of the United Nations. There have been problems, of course, but there have also been successes. In the words of the late President John Fitzgerald Kennedy “Let us not curse the remaining dark. Let us continue to gather the light.”
There will continue to be challenges and difficult issues that test the resolve of members, as well as those cited by many academics that are important to our international relations — for example, the resolution of national identity and self-determination issues; the increasing importance of non-State actors; great Power involvement in the third world; the role of religion in international politics; global militarization; and the perceived impotence of international law and international organizations such as the United Nations in dealing with very complicated forms of violent and non-violent conflict resolution.
But we must continue to advance the principles of reasoned discussion, dialogue and discourse, and the unswerving pursuit of peace. In the 31 years between 1914 and 1945, the world experienced two world wars, but in the 70 years since the end of the Second World War the United Nations has kept the world away from widespread war.
Let us work, hope and pray that we remain true to our peaceful character and that, even in the midst of provocation, we seek to keep the world safe, projecting an orientation of enforcing peaceful relations and shedding no innocent blood. Therefore, from Saint Lucia to the President I convey once again our warmest congratulations as he guides our proceedings over the next year.
"
70,2015,FRA,"Our Organization, the United Nations, is celebrating its seventieth anniversary. Immense progress has been made since it was established as an institution entrusted with the task of maintaining peace, which it has managed to do so on many an occasion. Yet, 70 years later dramas and tragedies, conflicts and wars continue to unfold, and the world must yet once again rise up to significant challenges. Among those of today is the flight of hundreds of thousands — even millions — of refugees from the Middle East and Africa, seeking protection or simply to save their lives. Terrorism strikes at civilian populations and no country is immune from this scourge. There are also conflicts, such as that in
the Middle East, that have remain unresolved for years and years, and that we all know could intensify at any moment.
In the meantime, there are disasters: tsunamis, earthquakes, islands on the verge of disappearing, coastlines washed away, and glaciers melting. That is the reality of climate change.
Faced with such challenges, we must all must shoulder our responsibilities at our respective levels. France, in many domains, has never refused its cooperation. France wished to host the Climate Change Conference, no doubt because we were aware of that terrible failure at Copenhagen and felt that this time we needed to make a good decision, one that can be taken only by the entire international community.
So in Paris, we must ask ourselves one question: is humankind capable of taking the decision to preserve life on the planet? Yes, that single question places us at a level that no one could ever imagine in our generation. Some will say, “But that can happen later, maybe at another conference”. I assure the Assembly here and I will say it quite plainly: if it does not happen in Paris, it will be too late for the world.
Matters have progressed well in recent months, and very strong declarations have been made by precisely those most responsible for global warming — the United States and China, which have made commitments that contribute to changing the current situation. Many calls have come from all continents, stressing the gravity and urgency of the situation and providing detailed testimony on what global warming is now, today. There are some countries that so far have been reluctant — here I am thinking of developing countries — and have asked themselves whether it is really useful to impose restrictions on themselves when the most developed countries have been free of such rules and obligations.
If asked today for a prognosis, and I often am, I will say that nothing has been settled in regard to winning an accord in Paris — nothing. But at the same time, everything remains possible. I see three conditions that must be met for us to be able to say that the Paris Conference was truly successful, worthy of us and of what was entrusted to us when we were asked to host the Conference.
The first condition is to be able to conclude a universal agreement applicable to all, one that is binding and differentiated so that everyone can do their own part, and not more. To date, 90 countries — half
of those sitting in the United Nations — have submitted their national contribution, which represents 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions — already a considerable figure. That means that half of the world has not yet responded. I therefore invite them to do so and to do so quickly so that we can determine as of now what, given the contributions from every State, we can assure the world will be the limit on global warming.
The second condition that will signify our success or failure is to be able to ensure that our resolution, our action, is long-lasting. The Paris accord must not be an end or a conclusion, but rather a starting point, the beginning of a process. Through incorporating a review mechanism into the agreement, we will be able to regularly review, periodically measure and even revise every five years our national contributions. That is what will allow us to be sure that at the end of the century, well beyond our time, the planet will not havewarmed by more than 2°C.
The third condition that will determine failure or success is developed countries making financial commitments. I am aware that already in Copenhagen the figure of $100 billion was announced to ensure the financing of energy transition, adaptation and technology transfer. We must collect $100 billion by 2020, but it must be said today so as to ensure that emerging countries, developing countries, can feel confident that they will be aided and supported so that this technological leap, the sharing of technology, will come about.
Yes, one hundred billion dollars. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is responsible for providing an initial estimate, to be presented at the Lima meeting. I wish here to thank the President of Peru for continuing the work he undertook at the twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The OECD will provide the initial estimate, as we have not reached $100 billion yet. So we have two months before the Paris Conference to continue to mobilize the World Bank, major development banks, financial institutions, States and private stakeholders so that we can reach $100 billion. Everyone should set an example. France abides by the rule that when serving as the host country; we must perform better than our guests, or at least as well as them.
I am announcing here today that France’s annual climate funding, which is €3 billion today, will be more than €5 billion in 2020. That increase in aid will
not be merely through loans, but also in the form of grants, because it is with grants — funds transferred directly and that will not be reimbursed — that we can powerfully promote the adaptation of developing countries to the effects of climate change.
In brief, if we are in a position to meet those three requirements — that is, a universal agreement, one that can be revised and will be revised every 5 years, and funding sufficient to cover everything that we will have to cover in emerging needs and future technology — then in Paris in two months we will be able to say we have risen to the challenge; not just a rendez-vous with history, but with the future.
It is good that the international community is able to look to the future and to say what sort of world we want. We did it with respect to the Sustainable Development Goals, and we must do it for climate issues. But what is expected of the United Nations is not simply to ensure — though this is already considerable — that the world will be liveable at the end of the century, but that it is liveable today, when conflicts and wars confront us with tragedies that in 1945, when the United Nations system was founded, nobody imagined we would ever see again.
Today, it is Syria that once again calls on us to mobilize and to intervene, as many speakers have already stated. Everyone considers that this is a tragedy striking the Syrian population. Everyone has said that we must find a solution. Let us look for it together. But first, we should assess what has not been done.
Three years ago, when I stood at this rostrum to address the General Assembly (see A/67/PV.6), there had already been 30,000 victims of the Syrian tragedy. There are now 250,000, and 12,000 children have died, victims of the Bashar Al-Assad regime. The Syrian tragedy began with a revolution led by those who wanted to challenge the dictatorship of Bashar Al-Assad. At that time, there were no terrorists, there were no fundamentalist groups — there was a dictator who was massacring a people. And the refugees whom we are discussing today, the refugees in the camps, the displaced, 8 million of them — this mass of women, men and children — have not just fled a war. For more than three years they have been fleeing from the regime of Bashar Al-Assad. And still today that same regime is raining bombs on innocent civilians.
But it is not because there is a terrorist group that itself massacres, kills, rapes, destroys — including
destruction of the common heritage of humankind — that some form of pardon, of amnesty, should necessarily be accorded to the regime that created this situation, as if the existence of a terrorist group that commits the worst kinds of evil acts could furnish the regime with a way to share in what is good. No, all those women, men and children are victims of this tragedy, which is generated by the alliance between terrorism and dictatorship. No solution can be found outside of a political process.
France, which, due to its history and also its links that bind it to that part of the world, intends to shoulder its responsibilities. It has already done so recently, including through armed action, through force. France wants to work with everyone; it does not exclude any country — neighbouring countries, which are most affected, the Gulf countries, but also Iran, the permanent members of the Security Council, as well as Europeans. We want to work with everyone, with everyone who wants to work with us.
There is talk of a coalition. This broad coalition is possible; it is even desirable and necessary in order to put an end to what is happening in Syria. But this coalition must have a clear basis or it will never see the light of day. The basis was provided in Geneva more than three years ago. And what did the Geneva agreement say? It specified a transitional Government with full powers, including members of the present Government and the opposition, formed on the basis of mutual consent. That is the basis; let us use it to move forward.
But I can see, in the context of this ongoing adversity, that some are making every diplomatic effort to incorporate Bashar Al-Assad in that process. But one cannot make the victims and the executioner work together. Al-Assad is at the origin of the problem; he cannot be part of the solution. We have to put an end to the suffering of the Syrian people, but we must also look beyond the political transition that has to be sought, the broad coalition that has to be formed, this condition that has to be laid down, to a new Government capable of uniting all those who have fought, but without the dictator.
We also have to be thinking about all the refugees. Until now, those refugees have been in neighbouring countries, but there too, the international community turned a blind eye because it was far away. Today those refugees, who can endure no more, are starting a long march. Yesterday, I recalled in the Assembly (see A/70/ PV.11) that 80 per cent of the world’s refugees — refugees
because of wars, conflicts, climate, poverty — are in the South. Solidarity with the South is coming from the South. Frequently, it is the most deprived who welcome the poorest. There comes a time when the refugees start to walk, and they can no longer be stopped. If we want to avoid what we have seen — tragedies, crossings that endanger the lives of passengers — if we want to prevent smugglers and criminals from using despair to further enrich the coffers of terrorism, then we must act.
Europe has hosted refugees coming not only from Syria, but also from Iraq, Eritrea and the Sudan. That was our duty, because Europe is based on values and principles, and the right to asylum is part of this common foundation that unites all the European countries, and which must continue uniting them. Otherwise, it is not the kind of Europe that we wanted.
But while Europe should discharge its duty, the world must help refugees. What have we learned those past days and weeks? That the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), due to lack of funds, no longer has the resources to ensure the necessary support and assistance to the populations in question. What have we learned? That the World Food Programme no longer has the means to provide all the refugees basic necessities and sufficient food. What have we learned? That in some neighbouring countries, refugees could not work.
This is the start of the cycle one would have imagined. If we want to reverse the flows, if we want to keep refugees as close as possible to their home countries, then we must fund UNHCR more, we must help neighbouring countries — Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey — but also countries in Africa, transit countries, countries where there is no migration. We need a major plan now, because tragedy is calling to act and to avert other tragedies. In that context, too, France is doing what it can, and must do what it should. And concerning the World Food Programme, France has decided to immediately increase by €100 million its support for United Nations agencies that are helping countries neighbouring Syria.
I want to end my speech by saying that the legitimacy of an Organization such as the United Nations rests on its credibility. If the United Nations does not have the capacity to resolve conflicts that have been going on for far too long, if the United Nations cannot resolve tragedies or ease the situation of civilian populations, then our helplessness will condemn us. If we want our
Organization — which is celebrating its seventieth anniversary — to have a future worthy of that which the founders imagined, we cannot avoid reform of the United Nations.
France calls for the enlargement of the Security Council. France calls for a different representation in the Security Council. France calls for continents to clearly bear responsibility for the world in the framework of the Security Council. France wants the permanent members of the Security Council to no longer resort to the right of veto in cases of mass atrocities. How can we tolerate that the United Nations, even today, remains paralysed when the worst is unfolding? There again, let us lead by example. I pledge here today that France will never use its right of veto in matters involving mass atrocities. The right of veto as it was introduced when the United Nations was founded was not the right to block; it was the right to act. We have to act. We can act. We have been showing that we can for 70 years. Here, today, we can act to settle the tragedies of today and to save the planet tomorrow. Let us act."
70,2015,BWA,"On behalf of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Botswana, Lieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama, allow me at the very outset to join other delegations in extending our heartiest congratulations to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. His election bears witness to the excellent credentials he brings to the office, which should greatly support the execution
of his mandate during this historic year on the United Nations calendar. We wish to assure him of Botswana’s unequivocal support throughout his term of office.
My delegation and I also wish to take this opportunity to recognize, with appreciation, his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, whose leadership and purposeful endeavours as President of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session were significantly evident in international efforts to address the global challenges confronting the world today. The high-level events he convened in that regard demonstrated his genuine commitment to sustainable development, to peace and security and to human rights and human dignity.
We are confident that the President’s efforts will further and firmly guide the general membership of the Organization onto a path that ensures the full and effective implementation of the historic post-2015 development agenda that world leaders adopted only a few short days ago.
I would be remiss not to seize this opportunity also to commend the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whose passion and dedication have been, and continue to be, instrumental to the work of the Organization.
The year 2015 marks an extraordinarily momentous year in the history of humankind. It is not only the seventieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations but also the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, the twentieth anniversary of the World Summit on Social Development, the
twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, and the fifteenth anniversary of the Millennium Summit, to mention but a few. That list of the global milestones is by no means exhaustive, but it demonstrates the resolute and enduring commitment of the United Nations to championing the cause of humankind.
The significance of this year impels us to pause and recall the purpose, ideals and founding principles upon which the United Nations was established. It is imperative that we reflect on the history of this eminent Organization and that we take account of what we, the international community, have achieved and can still achieve to safeguard the aspirations and integrity of the founders of the United Nations and to uphold the absolute primacy and veracity of the Charter. Furthermore, this year offers an opportunity for us to admit our failures and to draw attention to the areas where we have fallen short of fulfilling our individual and collective responsibility to deliver on all three anchors of human development: peace and security, development, and human rights.
The President’s choice of a theme for this year’s general debate, “The United Nations at 70 — a new commitment to action”, is therefore fitting, because it provides a pertinent context for our deliberation and reflection at this critical juncture in our lifetimes. Fifteen years ago, at the Millennium Summit of 2000, the largest gathering of world leaders in history adopted the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), which, inter alia, espoused the need for a people-centred framework for global development. That framework gave birth to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs were a landmark set of eight time-bound Goals aimed at addressing extreme poverty and social inequalities. For the first time, there was a clearly codified global agenda focusing nations around the world on priority areas for meeting the needs of the world’s poorest people and liberating them from the dehumanizing conditions of abject poverty. The Secretary-General’s final report on the MDGs, The Millennium Development Goals Report 2015, shows that significant progress has been made in realizing those Goals.
Those notable achievements notwithstanding, the sombre truth is that progress has largely been uneven across and within countries and regions. We continue to see multitudes — especially the poorest, vulnerable and marginalized in our societies — subjected to
unacceptable living conditions. Social exclusions and inequalities still present a significant challenge in most countries, with women and girls and the youth bearing the heaviest weight of those circumstances. The situation varies from one nation to another owing to their different national realities and capacities, requiring more focused and targeted interventions to effectively address the issues and ensure the sustainability of the developments achieved.
In Botswana, we are proud of the tremendous strides we have made in the implementation of the MDGs, particularly given the enormous resource and capacity constraints we faced, and continue to face, as we implement our development programmes and prepare to domesticate the new agenda. Poverty eradication, gender equality, the empowerment of women, girls and youth, job creation and equal access to health and other social services remain high on our national agenda. However, we march on with steadfast determination to ensure that every opportunity is seized, every effort is galvanized and every resource is employed to ensure the inherent dignity and fundamental freedoms of all the citizens of Botswana. That includes paying due attention to the needs of the aged and to people with disabilities. In that regard, the Botswana Government is currently in the final stages of developing the country’s National Vision 2030 and National Development Plan 11 in order to ensure firm alignment and complementarity between national aspirations and the building blocks to deliver them.
As dusk descends on the MDGs, the Government of Botswana has enthusiastically begun to prepare for the dawn of the new global development framework. Botswana therefore welcomes the highly anticipated adoption of the profoundly ambitious and transformative Sustainable Development Goals set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). which represent the culmination of more than two years of exceptionally intensive, broad and exhaustive negotiations. The Agenda represents a global vision for the sustained prosperity of humankind and the living planet, in which universal peace and security form the foundation for sustainable development across all nations.
We look forward to the effective implementation of the integrated and indivisible 17 Goals and 169 targets arrived at through an all-inclusive intergovernmental process, as mandated by the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development

in 2012. The Botswana Government embarks on this new course with increased optimism that we shall indeed realize the future that we all want.
In December, the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will convene in Paris to adopt a universal, legally binding agreement on climate change. The importance and urgency of this cannot be overemphasized. Climate change, if left unchecked, is arguably the greatest environmental challenge the world is facing, with potentially catastrophic consequences for our planet and future generations. We continue to witness a dangerous rise in sea levels, melting glaciers, a severe decline in agricultural output, changing weather patterns and health challenges caused by the changing climate conditions.
Climate change also presents a serious security threat, for it displaces millions of people and condemns an even greater number to sub-par living conditions. We extend our condolences to all those who have lost loved ones or who have experienced the destruction of property caused by natural disasters. Developing countries are the hardest hit, because they have limited capacities to respond to such effects and therefore require substantial assistance in developing climate-smart technology in order to reduce their vulnerability and to transition to low-carbon growth paths.
In the pursuit of global development that leaves no one behind, the Botswana delegation believes that particular focus should be given to countries in special situations and to the specific support they require to build their economies. In November 2014, the landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) met in Vienna to adopt the Vienna Programme of Action on Landlocked Developing Countries, which identifies six priority areas, including infrastructure development and maintenance, international trade and trade facilitation, regional integration and cooperation, and structural economic transformation. Botswana, like other LLDCs, will require a substantial augmentation of its capacity to implement any of those areas. That also holds true for middle-income countries, a category to which Botswana belongs. Figures show that 75 per cent of the world’s poorest populations live in middle-income countries.
The clarion call is therefore to explore the mechanisms by which such countries can be assisted in order to address entrenched and widespread poverty. The scale of the required assistance goes well beyond
the obvious need for infrastructure development, strengthening of institutions, access to technology, skills development and the development of social protection floors, inter alia. It is critically important to extend financing for development in order to address the specific needs and challenges of individual middle-income countries instead of employing a one-size-fits-all policy framework. Failure in that regard would be detrimental to the development trajectory of middle-income countries, with a real possibility that they could relapse to least developed country status.
Discussions have commenced in various United Nations platforms on how the Organization should transform itself to be better structured and better equipped to effectively and efficiently carry out its mandate and better serve the best interests of its Member States. Botswana believes that chief among the scores of considerations should be the coordination between and among the different United Nations agencies for stronger system-wide coherence that extends to improved cooperation with regional and subregional organizations. That, we believe, would go a long way towards enhancing international efforts to address the myriad challenges to development and to durable peace and security.
We cannot speak about development or about peace and security without considering the increasingly disturbing phenomenon of migration. The flow of international migrants has continued to grow exponentially since the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, which was held in New York in October 2013. Conflict, political instability and poverty are the main push factors for migration from developing to developed countries, as evidenced by the thousands who continue to cross the Mediterranean to Europe in search of economic opportunities. The grave conditions to which migrants are exposed, along with the unprecedented levels of humanitarian crises to which their movements contribute, are cause for great concern.
It is wrong to blame any single European country for its immigration policy, since each country has to assess its own ability to accommodate such influxes. Nor should Europe be blamed for the tragic drownings at sea, which are the fault of migrants’ countries of origin.
Botswana believes that the issue of migration warrants the urgent attention of the international community, with a view to developing a comprehensive
15-29664 3/25

A/70/PV.23 01/10/2015
and lasting solution. The imposition of quotas to make it mandatory for countries to accept migrants or refugees is not the best solution. Instead, consideration should be given to rewarding and supporting the countries that accept migrants or refugees by setting up a special fund under the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Europe, or preferably the entire international community, should contribute annually to such a fund, based on an assessment of each country’s economic status and whether it is hosting refugees. If anything should be mandatory, it should be that approach. In summary, the more refugees a country takes, the bigger its reward or support and the lower its contribution to the fund.
We welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative to convene the first-ever World Humanitarian Summit next year. It should not only enhance existing and new efforts to address the issue of migration, but should also ensure comprehensive, coherent and cohesive approaches for responding to the critically urgent issue of the global humanitarian architecture.
Botswana remains gravely concerned about the serious threats to international peace and security in many parts of the world, which arguably present the greatest challenge to human development. We are witnessing an alarming rise in instability, insecurity and violent conflicts which are causing untold devastation and human suffering. The unremitting loss of innocent lives and the escalation in humanitarian crises have reached tragic levels, making it imperative for the international community to take urgent and decisive action. We take this opportunity to commend all humanitarian and human rights organizations for the good work they do on behalf of humankind.
The growing involvement of non-State actors and radical extremists in most conflict situations is deeply troubling. The activities of such entities introduce additional layers of difficulty to the processes for the management and resolution of conflicts. Terrorism, including the emergence of abductions as one of its many forms, further increases the complexity of the response to conflict in areas of unrest.
In a world in which borders are porous and nations are increasingly interdependent, threats to security in any region have consequences for all. The only difference is in the degree of impact. In Africa, the situations in Somalia, Libya and South Sudan, to mention but a few, are a current preoccupation and a cause of deep concern for the continent. However, the
African Union, through its regional mechanisms and international support, is actively engaged in efforts to resolve the conflicts. Botswana remains fully supportive of those ongoing efforts. We hope that lasting solutions can be found before there is any further loss of innocent lives and before instability becomes entrenched in those societies.
In other parts of the world, we remain deeply concerned about the situation in the Middle East. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has remained unresolved for several decades, without any real promise of an end in sight. Botswana continues to lend its unequivocal support to the two-State solution, and we join the call for constructive dialogue by the parties involved.
Of particular concern in the Middle East are the political crisis in Yemen and the protracted war in Syria. The latter especially has wreaked unprecedented havoc on a people, to an extent not seen since the Second World War. Botswana is profoundly troubled that the Security Council nonetheless seems paralysed by the hard divisions among its members that prevent it from upholding its responsibilities under Chapter V of the Charter of the United Nations and from taking decisive action against the Syrian Government. Despite the carnage and property destruction of unspeakable proportions that have raged in that country since 2011, some Council members still obstruct initiatives intended to end the war and alleviate the desperate plight of the poor Syrian people.
Horrified by the torment visited with appalling impunity upon the Syrian people by their own Government, Botswana joined 58 concerned members of the international community in 2013 to petition the Security Council to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court. We deeply regret that action on that matter continues to be frustrated by divisions within the Council.
In the light of such challenges, Botswana continues to firmly support the initiative of France calling for the permanent members of the Council to refrain from using their veto power in situations involving mass atrocities. The United Nations, which promotes democracy around the globe, should lead by example. The Security Council is not an example of democracy when permanent membership is limited to five countries, which have a veto. There should be no permanent members and no veto at all. The practice of might making right is actually wrong.

Generally speaking, States have the primary responsibility to ensure the protection of their people. In reality, however, some States, such as Syria, are manifestly failing to exercise that responsibility. Instead, they violate international humanitarian law with shameful impunity. Clearly, that should trigger the application of measures under pillars two and three of the responsibility to protect — yet nothing is happening. Might it be time to make the responsibility to protect a formal agenda item for debate by the General Assembly? Perhaps such a debate could provide sufficient impetus for the Security Council to carry the full mantle of its mandate, including by improving its relationship with the International Criminal Court in order to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of the perpetrators of crimes against humanity.
Botswana’s commitment to a strong and effective international justice system remains resolute. Our belief in the International Criminal Court as the only standing international criminal tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity is unwavering. The Botswana Government regrets that non-cooperation by some States parties to the Rome Statute still plagues the Court, creating leeway for continued impunity and escape from accountability for crimes against humanity. We therefore urge all parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to stand fully behind the Court. Cooperation is vital to for the assurance of the Court’s integrity and effective functioning.
My delegation and I are hopeful that, as we commemorate the 70 years of the United Nations, we can have unanimous agreement that judicial accountability, inclusive governance and the protection and promotion of human rights are essential elements for peaceful societies. That should not be seen as the preserve of the International Criminal Court or of the Security Council alone, but rather as a shared responsibility and norm of the global community.
Finally, the sooner the world is rid of the feeble leadership of Sepp Blatter at the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, the better. Corruption, poor governance and a leader who has gone well beyond his sell-by date make that organization almost a mirror image of a failed State. Good governance should not apply to politics alone, but to all institutions, especially international organizations.
Let me conclude by reaffirming Botswana’s commitment to and abiding faith in the purposes and founding principles of the United Nations. We
are strongly committed to a world that nurtures and sustains all life within the natural limits of the living planet, leaving absolutely no one behind. Botswana is truly optimistic in its belief that, with genuine political will and concerted collective effort, such a world can be achieved.

70,2015,ECU,"We passionately support the proposal of our dear colleague and friend, President Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera of Costa Rica, that the next Secretary-General should be a woman. Our region is home to such exemplary women as Michelle Bachelet, Cristina Fernández, Dilma Rousseff, María Emma Mejía Vélez, Alicia Bárcena Ibarra and others.
It is nothing short of heroic for members of the Assembly to be sitting here when there were 18 speakers yesterday morning and 16 in the afternoon, for a total of 34, and we are two hours behind. I thank United Nations staff for working beyond the call of duty, but I think it is time for us to change our methodology, because this does not make much sense. This is the third meeting I have attended. It is 9.30 p.m. and I am speaker number 34. If I am unable to move hearts in three minutes then I am going to move chairs, because people are just going to get up and leave. So I thank everyone for being here. Things could have been worse. Evo Morales Ayma could have been next. I offer him my fond greetings.
The United Nations was born on 24 October 1945 from the ashes of the Second World War to maintain international peace and security. After the suffering of the Holocaust, we thought that peace meant only the absence of war, but in the twenty-first century, 70 years later, peace should above all mean presence — the presence of justice, the presence of dignity, the presence of development. As Gandhi said, “Poverty is the worst form of violence.” The Community of Latin American and Caribbean States has proclaimed our region a continent of peace, but the offensive opulence of a few coexisting with the most intolerable poverty is a
daily assault on human dignity. Peace without justice is nothing more than pacification.
The 164 million people living in poverty in Latin America, of whom 68 million live in extreme poverty, are still waiting for justice, freedom and real democracy — not democracy reduced to holding periodic elections. Overcoming poverty is the greatest moral imperative for our planet, because today, for the first time in the history of humankind, poverty is the fruit not of scarcity of resources or natural factors but of unjust, exclusionary systems that are the product of twisted power structures. As far back as two centuries ago, the liberal French philosopher Frédéric Bastiat said as much when he denounced the fact that
“When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men in a society, over the course of time they create for themselves a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it.”
Let those who want to steal such sublime concepts as freedom understand that there can be no freedom without justice. And that is not all. In regions with the kind of inequality that exists in Latin America, only by seeking justice will we achieve true freedom. Therefore, we must not settle for minimalist goals, as we did with the Millennium Development Goals. A perspective based on bare minimums legitimizes our current reality, which places the beneficiary in a position of inferiority with respect to others and makes no attempt to remedy the distances or power relations between individuals and societies.
As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said this morning, “our aim is not just to keep people alive, but to give them a life” (see A/70/PV.13) — a dignified, full life with conditions equal to those enjoyed by every other human being. We believe that the 17 Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) come closer to that aspiration. We are setting shared Goals not only for life’s for minimums but social maximums — the sumak kawsay or well-being of our ancestral peoples, which represents a way of living with dignity, satisfying basic needs but in harmony with oneself, with one’s fellow human beings and with different cultures, as well as with nature.
However, as we said yesterday in this same Hall (see A/70/PV.10), the absence in the 2030 Agenda of a specific goal on freedom of movement is a highly regrettable omission. If, on the one hand, we promote the free circulation of goods in search of maximum


profit, while, on the other hand, we criminalize the free movement of persons in search of decent work, we have an immoral paradox that is simply intolerable and unsustainable from an ethical point of view. It is one of the biggest contradictions of neoliberal globalization, which seeks not to create global societies but merely global markets and exists only to benefit capital and not human beings. The solution is not more borders but solidarity and humanity, as well as the creation of conditions for prosperity and peace that remove the incentive for migration.
But there is great news. The Sustainable Development Goals, as their name indicates, place a major focus on caring for the planet. Generally speaking, there have been improvements in the efficiency of productive process, including a reduction in the intensity of global energy. In other words, the quantity of energy required for one unit of production registered a 1.2 per cent drop between 1971 and 2009. But despite technological advances and the dematerialization of the economy, there is ever greater consumption of global energy. Emissions have multiplied by a factor of 3.6 in 50 years, which translates into an annual average growth of 2.6 per cent. If that trend continues, in 28 years current emissions will have doubled. The evidence suggests that energy consumption and the generation of emissions are directly proportionate to income levels, which allows consumption to trump efficiency. The inhabitant of a wealthy country produces 38 times more carbon emissions than someone who lives in a poor country, all of which leads to the principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities.
Of course, there are also environmental effects linked to poverty, such as soil erosion and the lack of proper solid waste treatment, inter alia. Another problem is that the gap in energy efficiency between rich and poor countries remains abysmal and continues to grow over time, having increased by a factor of 4 to 5 between 1971 and 2010. Overcoming such gaps depends on access to knowledge, science and technology. Here, too, there is a huge disparity between rich and poor countries. Rich countries file 1,360,000 patents every year, while all the poor countries combined file only 9,170 patents.
Global inequities are reflected not only in the distribution of emissions, but also in the impact of global warming and climate change. Countries like Ecuador contribute less than 1 per cent of total carbon emissions, yet they suffer the effects of climate change.
For example, the only penguin that lives directly on the equator — spheniscus mendiculus, commonly known as the Galapagos penguin — is endangered due to the warming of surface marine waters. It is therefore vital to move towards a universal declaration on the rights of nature. The primary universal right of nature should be for it to continue to exist, but it should also be able to continue to provide our societies with the necessary sustenance to enable them continue to live according to sumak kawsay. That should be a core idea for avoiding certain forms of fundamentalism. The human being is not the only important being in nature, although he remains the most important.
Nevertheless, in spite of those common but differentiated responsibilities and the role played by access to knowledge, science and technology, paradoxically, there is now a new unjust international division of labour. Rich countries generate knowledge that they privatize, and many poor or middle-income countries produce environmental goods that are consumed for free. Knowledge in general is a good that enjoys free access — in other words, exclusion is technically impossible or very costly. To avoid free access, to privatize that good, institutional barriers are raised, namely, intellectual property rights.
The countries of the Amazon Basin also produce free-access goods, in this case environmental goods that regulate the global climate and without which life on the planet would worsen considerably. Despite that, the big global polluters pay nothing for consuming those environmental goods and services. Sometimes it is thought that the generation of environmental goods has no cost. The reality is that it can be very costly, not in terms of direct costs but in terms that what we are renouncing to continue those environmental goods: the opportunity cost.
By the way, today many demand that we should not exploit the oil in the Amazon, without citing any moral grounds for that assertion. But that involves a huge cost in terms of non-received income, and for every passing day it means a child is unable to go to school, a community goes without drinking water or people are dying due to perfectly avoidable illnesses, true pathologies of misery. If we were compensated for the consumption of environmental goods, we would no longer need financing for development.
Conservation is another fundamental idea for any debate on sustainability. In poor countries — or in countries with poor people — conservation would


not be possible if it did not generate clear, direct improvements in the standards of living of the population. As Pope Francis said in his encyclical Laudato si’, a true ecological approach always becomes a social approach. Access to science and technology is vital for poor countries in their struggle against climate change and poverty. As Paraguay’s President, Horacio Manuel Cartes Jara, said moments ago, it is vital to declare technologies that mitigate climate change and their respective effects as global public goods and to guarantee their free access.
The new international division of labour is a complete paradox. The goods of free access should have no rival in terms of consumption; they should have no marginal cost if they are consumed by an additional person. As a result, when more people use that good, the better. That is normally the characteristic of knowledge, science and technology. As George Bernard Shaw once said very rightly, if you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples, then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.
Contrariwise, when a good becomes scarce or is destroyed little by little as it is consumed, as is the case with environmental goods, that is when the consumption should be restricted to avoid what Garrett Hardin called the tragedy of the commons. Why is not the obvious being done? Indeed, why is the complete opposite being done? It is not a technical problem, but a political one. The unjust new international division of labour is nothing other than the distorted logic of privatizing the benefits and socializing the losses. Nothing justifies that approach, just power.
Just imagine for a moment that the situation was reversed: the generators of environmental goods and services were the rich countries, and the poor or middle-income countries were the polluters. Is there any doubt that by now they would not have invaded us to demand from us “fair compensation”? This is an impressive difference, but the problem of climate change only be controlled with simply more justice, in this case environmental justice. Unfortunately, as Thrasymachus said more than 2,000 years ago in his dialogue with Socrates, justice is nothing other than the advantage of the stronger.
At the end of 2015 we will meet in Paris for the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. If we fail at that meeting and do not reach binding agreements to protect the only planet that we have, our civilization could start to be buried. But if we gain a victory we will celebrate twenty-second conference with an environmental manifesto that was first written in 1225 by Saint Francis of Assisi, who expressed gratitude for Brother Wind, for the air, the sky, the clouds, the serene heavens and all time.
Ecuador looks on with hope at the restoration of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States of America. We hope that that process leads to the lifting of the embargo and the closing of the base at Guantánamo. It will not be a concession of any power, rather it will be a triumph of justice and dignity of the Cuban people. I was saddened to hear President Obama say that he proposed ending 50 years of embargo not because it was a violation of international law, of the rights of the Cuban people, of human rights, but because it had not functioned. There is no concession on that: what we are talking about is the justice and dignity of Cuban people after 50 years of heroic resistance.
Our peoples will never again accept trusteeship, interference or intervention. Seared into our memory are the abuses and violence of the past, even though we are asked to forget them and to look only to the future.
Ecuador supports Argentina in its sovereign right to the Malvinas Islands, a disgraceful and completely unacceptable vestige of colonialism in the twentieth century.
We recognize the State of Palestine. It should be a State Member of the Organization, a fully fledged Member within its 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
We welcome the recent agreements reached between the Colombian Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. Ecuador hopes for peace for Colombia, and we support them in that endeavour.
Ecuador also expresses solidarity with the Syrian people, the victim of a conflict that has destroyed families, goods and people. Certain Powers ignored the principle of non-interference in foreign affairs and have only exacerbated the violence. We hope that peace will be restored for the Syrian people, and we reiterate that only they can decide on their own future.
Ecuador profoundly values its relationship with Africa and will 

America Summit in May 2016, to which all the countries of the two regions have been invited. In October 2016 we will be hosting the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, which is held only every 20 years. A new urban agenda will be drafted at that meeting, and we firmly believe in the right to inclusive cities with sustainable urban growth.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to condemn once again before the world an environmental disaster that was 85 times worse than the British Petroleum spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, and 18 times worse than the Exxon Valdez spill off the coast of Alaska in 1989. I am referring to the contamination left behind by the Texaco oil company, which maintained operations in the Ecuadorian Amazon until 1992 and was bought by the multinational oil company Chevron in 2001. Chevron, the third-largest company in the United States, was sued approximately 20 years ago by indigenous communities of the Amazon who had been affected by the pollution. It is a strictly a private civil case, Amazon Defence Coalition vs. Chevron-Texaco.
Chevron spent the previous decade fighting to keep the case from being tried in New York, where the company has its corporate headquarters, preferring to have it adjudicated where the offence was allegedly committed, in the province of Sucumbios in Ecuador. Nevertheless, as Chevron lost the case and was ordered to pay a large sum, it has spent 10 years destroying the reputation of the same courts that it had enthusiastically defended when it thought that it could buy them off, while spending hundreds of millions of dollars in a global campaign to discredit Ecuador.
Transnational corporations must cease their abuses against the States and peoples of the South. Ecuador calls upon Member States to participate in drafting a binding treaty to sanction transnational corporations when they violate human rights or pollute the environment.
We invite those present to visit Ecuador and put their hands into the hundreds of pools left by Texaco, so that they can feel for themselves the oil waste that was left behind, 20 years after the oil company left our country. That is the dirty hand of Chevron.
Faced with Chevron-Texaco’s arrogance, its billions of dollars and the infamy of this corrupt and corrupting company, Ecuador will fight back with the most lethal of any weapon ever invented: the truth.
"
70,2015,COL,"I would like to thank our Ambassador Maria Emma Mejía Vélez for giving me the floor. What a source of great pride it is for us that a Colombian woman is presiding over this meeting at this historic moment, when the General Assembly is considering the topic “The United
Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”, which is the road along which Colombia is travelling, now more successfully than ever before.
I am therefore honoured to come to this Assembly to share some news which is also historic. Today, I proclaim to the entire world that one of the more than 20 armed conflicts taking place across the globe, which are causing so much pain, poverty and suffering, that of my country, Colombia, is finally nearing a genuine solution. We will put an end to the longest and most recent armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere. Achieving peace — in Colombia or in any part of the world — is a responsibility that nobody must shirk.
As Pope Francis said so well a few days ago in the Congress of the United States of America,
“When countries which have been at odds resume the path of dialogue — a dialogue which may have been interrupted for the most legitimate of reasons — new opportunities open up for all. This has required, and requires, courage and daring, which is not the same as irresponsibility.”
In Colombia we have tried to work with the courage, the audacity and also the sense of responsibility of which the Holy Father spoke, and we are beginning to see the fruits of our efforts. We have had more than 50 years of internal warfare in a country destined for progress and happiness, and we are determined to put an end to that conflict. Peace is a difficult goal to attain, but not an impossible one. Peace is something more than the fruit of a political, social or economic process. Peace, more than anything, is a great process of collective cultural transformation that begins with an individual spiritual change, and it requires that all individuals — each within himself or herself— open their minds, hearts and souls to reconciliation.
Why do I say that today I come to this Assembly with greater optimism than ever before? Well, it is because less than a week ago in Havana, after almost three years of negotiations in which we made progress on most of the items on the agreed agenda, we reached an agreement on what was perhaps the major obstacle to peace. We reached an agreement on the most difficult element of any peace process — a system of transitional justice that ensures that there is no impunity for the most serious crimes committed during the conflict. In this agreement, which respects the norms and principles of international law and our own Constitution, we put the greatest emphasis on the right of victims to justice
30/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
and on truth, reparations and the non-resumption of the conflict, placing them at the centre of the solution to an armed conflict. And we are reaching our goal: the maximum degree of justice compatible with the attainment of peace.
It is also the first time in the history of conflicts in the world that a Government and an illegal armed group — in a peace agreement, not as the result of something that was imposed later on — are creating a system of accountability in a domestic court for international crimes and other serious crimes. We are setting a precedent that could serve as a model for other armed conflicts in the world. The progress made is so important and significant that it has enabled us to take two additional steps, which is the best news that I could convey to this great forum of nations. We have agreed to a deadline for signing the final agreement that would put an end to our armed conflict. It will be, at the very latest, 23 March 2016, in less than six months from now. On that date at the very latest, we shall bid a final farewell to the last and longest war not just in Colombia, but in the entire Western Hemisphere. In addition, we have also agreed that the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) will begin to lay down its weapons no later than 60 days following the signing of the final agreement. That means that next year, when I return to this Assembly, I will do so as President of a Colombia that is at peace and has achieved reconciliation.
Our talks with the FARC guerrilla forces offer a glimmer of hope in a world overshadowed by war, violence and terrorism. This is also an opportunity to thank the international community, on behalf of 48 million Colombians, for its support for our peace efforts and for its willingness to assist us in the post- conflict stage. A peaceful Colombia will be a positive factor for the world in several distinct but interrelated areas, such as combating climate change and illegal drugs, security and eradicating extreme poverty.
Our country is proud to be the most biodiverse country in the world in relation to its size. However, we are also one of the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. That is why we insist on the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals. At the end of my term in office in 2018, I hope to have left behind protected areas in Colombia of approximately 20 million hectares, accounting for almost one-fifth of our landmass. We fully support the twenty-first session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is to be held at the end of this year in Paris, where we will commit to assisting in the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
We are also addressing the problem of illegal drug crops with a comprehensive strategy that we have proposed to the rest of the world. At the Summit of the Americas, held in Cartagena, Colombia, in 2012, I raised the need for an objective assessment of the outcome of the so-called war on drugs declared here more than 40 years ago, which has been so costly in human lives and resources. The study was conducted and submitted by the Organization of American States two years ago. Now, we are preparing for the special session of the General Assembly on this issue to take place seven months from now. We continue to advocate a new global strategy based on scientific evidence that puts greater emphasis on health, education and tackling the social roots of this phenomenon and seeks to minimize the negative effects of drugs through the use of smarter, more effective and more humane strategies.
In Colombia, we have gone even further. Last week, I presented a comprehensive crop-substitution plan based on that multifaceted approach. Not only will we attack the mafias, whom we will pursue relentlessly, but we will also provide social and economic opportunities for farmers, ensure that the State and the justice system are ever-present, prevent drug use and treat it as a public health issue. If we end the conflict, the guerrilla forces that have been a negative factor in drug-trafficking will become, once they lay down their weapons, an ally in combating it. It will be extraordinarily symbolic when those who once protected these illicit crops will help us to eradicate them. In that way, Colombia wins and the entire world wins. We will begin to free ourselves from coca and, at the same time, to preserve and save millions of hectares of tropical forest. As the Pope so eloquently said in this very Hall four days ago, “war is the negation of all rights and a dramatic assault on the environment” (A/70/PV.3, p. 5).
A peaceful Colombia will also be a safer Colombia because the enormous energy and effort that today are dedicated to dealing with this domestic conflict will be focused on improving security and on fighting crime in the cities and villages of my country. Of course, it will be a Colombia with more opportunities for everyone where we will continue to reduce poverty and create jobs, as we have been doing at a rate that has made us the leader in Latin America in terms of social progress,
15-29431 31/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
in recent years. Achieving peace will enable us to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, which are now enshrined in Colombian law and which we adopted in 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).
I now invite all Colombians, without exception, and all citizens of the world to pave the way for peace. The most worthwhile legacy we could leave to our children and to future generations is peace. Nothing could be more important or more urgent because peace is the supreme good of any society. It is the most sacred good and the very reason for the existence of the United Nations. Today, I am delighted to announce the good news that, in fewer than six months, bells will toll in Colombia to announce that the time for peace has come. I hope that clocks around the world will be synchronized with our own to show the same time — a time for peace, a time for humankind.
"
70,2015,BLZ,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and to assure you of Belize’s steadfast support and cooperation. I deem it both fortuitous and fitting that I am accorded the privilege of addressing the Assembly on the occasion of the International Day of Non-Violence.
The theme of this session, “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead to peace, security and human rights”, provokes the question of whether the United Nations, as presently constituted, is up to the task of providing the world community with the protection that it will so genuinely need in the coming years and expects to obtain. While the events that gave rise to the founding of the United Nations seventy years ago are in many respects similar to some of the events we see today, it can legitimately be argued that the world of 1945 was neither confronted with, nor could it contemplate a phenomenon as potentially intractable and catastrophic as climate change. Does it therefore follow that the United Nations is not imbued with the resilience to deal satisfactorily or adequately with that most ominous and dreaded phenomenon?
Thanks to the information age and the attendant communication revolution, the ubiquitous media, both mass and social, incessantly publish disquieting global events widely and instantaneously. The events accentuated by the media are, for the most part, those that speak to the multifarious threats, misfortunes and disasters being experienced on a daily basis by humankind. Those threats have their roots in human-
made causes. The accelerated phenomenon of climate change — giving rise to the inexorable melting of the glaciers, the rising and warming of the oceans and seas, the spawning of super typhoons, hurricanes, tornadoes and floods, droughts, desertification, and the indiscriminate igniting of conflagrations of gigantic proportions - is increasingly attributed to anthropogenic interference with the climate system.
The senseless violence and excesses of terrorists, religious extremists, rogue soldiers, police and security personnel, human and drug traffickers, and regimes that brutally, mercilessly and wantonly slaughter their own citizens and citizens of other countries who in their view pose a clear and present danger to them or to their vital interests — all these constitute human-made threats to the world’s population.
Of all those threats, however, the one that poses the greatest existential threat to our entire planet and all living things thereon is climate change. Eminent scientists opine and predict that the damage that will be done to the world’s marine life and ecosystems caused by, for example, melting glaciers and rising sea temperatures alone are incalculable and irremediable. They predict that there will be a similar impact on the world’s flora and fauna and terrestrial ecosystems from large-scale and indiscriminate deforestation and desertification. One obvious consequence, among others, of such occurrences could be a severe curtailment in the world’s vital food supply and the advent of the spectre of massive starvation worldwide. Such occurrences would unquestionably have a negative impact on all of humanity, for we all inhabit the same planet and share the same core needs, adequate food supply being only one of them.
Even as the United Nations endeavours to deal with the dire consequences of climate change, it still must dutifully serve the aspirations of our peoples to enhance their economic and social development. Although globally we can claim some success in poverty eradication, the current unprecedented, desperate and perilous flight of hundreds of thousands of people from the perennially impoverished South to more affluent regions is irrefutable evidence of the most urgent need to do more for the poor and the powerless.
It is axiomatic that in times of deep personal crisis, such as when someone is diagnosed with a terminal illness, one does not stop to count the cost of finding a cure. On the contrary, strenuous efforts are immediately initiated in search of one, even if that
15-29816 33/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
entails the exhaustion of one’s life savings. Given the clear and present existential threat posed by climate change, it is imperative that that threat be treated with no less urgency and gravity than that with which a diagnosis of a terminal illness is treated. And we must do so in tandem with our ongoing quests to vest our people with hope, opportunities and a chance for the future that they deserve.
To that end, our world community must be prepared to deploy whatever resources that may be required without counting the costs. It would be most unwise for the wealthy nations — whose historic responsibility it is to furnish those necessary resources without this proof — to regard contributions made to meet these challenges as simply an exercise in philanthropy or altruism. Nothing could be further from the truth. Such contributions are vital investments in the survival of planet Earth and of all living things therein.
Some countries are evidently in greater and more immediate danger than others from the effects of climate change at this time. What is happening in the Bahamas as we speak and what happened in Dominica and in still earlier in Vanuatu are constant and incontestable reminders of the particular vulnerability of small island developing States (SIDS) and low-lying coastal States, like my own country, Belize. My Government expresses its deep solidarity with our fellow SIDS and assures the Assembly of our fullest support for them. Today, they are on the front lines; tomorrow it will be us. For no country will escape the devastating impacts of climate change, which does not defer to size, borders or wealth, or lack thereof.
The lessons of history are salutary. The tragic sinking of the mighty Titanic reminds us that whereas those passengers berthed in the lower decks were the first to perish as that giant ship made its perilous descent toward the dark depths of the Atlantic on that fateful day of 10 April 1912, ultimately all passengers on that ill-fated ship who had not been rescued in life rafts perished by drowning, including those berthed on the top-most deck. We cannot afford to forget for one moment that all of us human beings are merely passengers on planet Earth, sailing ceaselessly in the celestial firmament.
Belize is ever mindful that our community of nations, not unlike the proverbial chain that is only as strong as its weakest link, is only as strong as the weakest of its members. Small and weak though they may be, nations like my own form an integral part of
humankind’s food chain and security ecosystem. Any impairment of that food chain or security ecosystem potentially imperils the security of humankind globally.
In its 70-year history, the United Nations has undeniably made notable inroads to combat climate change and promote sustainable development. It has galvanized attention to climate change and adopted a Framework Convention to fashion a global response to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions without jeopardizing global development. The United Nations has marshalled financial, scientific and technological support for countries in need of it and, with the adoption of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), signaled a global transformation for planet, people and prosperity.
But the jury is still out on the United Nations record of achievements. Notwithstanding a global commitment to tackle climate change, our efforts have been less than ambitious, and achieving a successor global emission reduction regime hangs in the balance, not least because finance and technology are conspicuously wanting. Worse yet, the failure of the world’s Powers to agree to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels will certainly condemn small island developing States and low-lying coastal States.
Our misses in peace and security are no less grave, with the vulnerable paying the price of political expediency. Through our awesome power of communication the world is stricken with the unanswered cries of men, women and children suffering from indiscriminate acts perpetrated in Syria, Palestine, Israel, Nigeria, Ukraine and beyond.
This condition brings me back to the question posed at the beginning of my statement regarding the capacity of the United Nations to address the most pressing global challenges. Belize entertains no doubt that the power, wealth and knowledge that lie within the collective membership of the United Nations make it capable of achieving stupendous feats. But we must first commit to working together and with all stakeholders — large and small, public and private. Unity is strength. The might of the United Nations rests in its universality and the endurable values enshrined in its Charter. Belize readily shoulders its responsibilities as a member of this community of nations.
We are committed to doing everything in our power that will promote the containment, if not the
34/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
reversal, of climate change. We have joined with our brothers and sisters of the small island and low-lying developing States in a pioneering initiative — the Small Island Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative, which Belize proudly hosts — to foster our transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies. We also commit to pushing for a robust and ambitious regime in Paris that will have all of us working in lockstep to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions and safeguard the planet and the sustainable development of our people.
Likewise, we stand ready to provide every support to United Nation initiatives that will bring the warring factions in Syria, and in Israel and Palestine, to the table to find peaceful solutions to their differences. We are committed to combating terrorism, and we unreservedly condemn the atrocities perpetrated against women and girls in Nigeria by Boko Haram. We express our solidarity with the Nigerian Government on its efforts to dismantle that criminal gang and bring its members to justice.
Belize supports the ongoing initiatives to reform the United Nations to make it more representative and better able to maintain peace and resolve conflicts. We continue to call for the United Nations to engage with Taiwan, whose 23 million people stand ready to contribute, especially through United Nations specialized agencies, to resolving the world’s problems and who have every expectation that their interests should be heard and represented.
We welcome the unanimous support for the Security Council decision to terminate seven resolutions that inflicted sanctions on Iran upon receipt by the Council of a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Belize also welcomes the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, and we urge the United States to now proceed expeditiously to ending the very damaging embargo against Cuba and to return Guantanamo Bay to the Cuban Government.
We call upon powerful arms-producing nations to refrain from selling arms and weapons to those who use them to oppress others, and to warlords in war-torn countries.
Belize has always taken peace, security and respect for human rights very seriously. Our Constitution is modelled on the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in which the protection of fundamental rights
and freedoms is enshrined. The Belize Government assiduously respects the rule of law.
Belize also endeavours to be a good global citizen. Our laws have evolved to reflect international norms and standards, covering areas from human rights to finance, creating enabling environments that promote and protect the fundamental freedoms of our people, and fostering socially responsible investment in our country. Our National Assembly has recently enacted a new and robust Banking Act and has improved regulations for our Ship Registry to bring them in line with global efforts, including those of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, so as to enhance transparency and strengthen our legislative framework.
Our Government has focused very heavily on improving the lives of ordinary Belizeans. We are investing millions of dollars in improving infrastructure countrywide, including the construction and refurbishment of schools, sporting facilities, hospitals and roads. We are investing heavily in road safety to reduce injuries and deaths associated with traffic accidents. Access to public health services has been expanded throughout the country. We have made it easier for Belizeans to access affordable credit by ensuring an unprecedented reduction in interest rates through the establishment of our very own National Bank of Belize. Unemployment has been significantly reduced, by 10 per cent, while at the same time we have been able to keep the inflation rate among the lowest in our region.
Belize believes fervently in integration and in peaceful coexistence. To that end, we are also doing our part to ensure that peace and security prevail in our part of the world. Together with all Latin American and Caribbean countries, we have jointly designated our region as a zone of peace. Alongside the Caribbean Community, we stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Haiti as they deal with the human rights impasse with their sister nation, the Dominican Republic. We also stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Guyana and Venezuela as they work towards an amicable solution to their territorial dispute.
Earlier this year, we signed a protocol to the Special Agreement between Belize and Guatemala, to submit Guatemala’s territorial insular and maritime claim to our country to the International Court of Justice. We expect that will facilitate and speed up the process to finally and definitively put an end to the unfounded

claims that have plagued us and our region for far too long.
"
70,2015,MMR,"First of all, I should like to join previous speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I am confident that your able leadership and diplomatic skills will steer our deliberations to a successful conclusion. I assure you of my delegation’s full support and cooperation.
I should also like to commend the outstanding work of your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, at the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly.
This year marks the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. This historic occasion affords us the opportunity to reflect on and look back at the achievements of the world Organization. The United Nations was founded to safeguard international peace and security in order to save succeeding generations
15-29822 11/29

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
from the scourge of war. The Organization deserves the highest credit for its achievement in preventing the outbreak of another world war of the kind that has plagued us twice in the past. On the other hand, it is confronted with regional conflicts, a rising tide of non-traditional threats and violent extremism. We need to do more to address these challenges, collectively.
There are also achievements in bringing a better life to all. Lifting millions out of poverty, sending millions more children to school, combating deadly diseases, and promoting gender equality and human rights are remarkable milestones in the United Nations journey. The unanimous adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) last week has added to the long list of its achievements.
Still, daunting challenges remain. The colonial legacy with its inherited divisions influences today’s conflicts across the world, depriving many of economic and social development. The rising threats of terrorism and acts of violent extremism need to be addressed decisively. Climate change and environmental degradation are undermining the development and lives of the poor. Inequalities are widening, pushing the poor further behind. The time is now opportune to do soul-searching on the future of the Organization and to strengthen our collective resolve to address the challenges of our time, particularly to advance its priorities, capacity and reform.
Today’s new and emerging challenges are increasingly calling the effectiveness and efficiency of the Organization into question. While the cardinal principles of the Charter of the United Nations remain valid today, the world Organization, which was founded seven decades ago, needs to be reformed in conformity with today’s changing realities and the drastic growth in membership. We believe that the Security Council also has to be reformed to make it more representative, efficient and transparent and to strengthen its capacity to better discharge its responsibilities to maintain international peace and security, as entrusted by the Charter.
As part of the United Nations reform, we set up the Human Rights Council in 2006 to redress the shortcomings of its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights. Yet, human rights issues are increasingly politicized and exploited. The principles of universality, objectivity and non-selectivity are at stake. Myanmar firmly believes that the universal periodic review is the
forum where promotion and protection of human rights can best be addressed with objectivity and impartiality on an equal footing.
The most significant milestone contribution Myanmar has made to the United Nations was providing the Organization with a Secretary-General. He served the Organization from 1961 to 1971 at a difficult time of ideological contention, mistrust and security tensions among nations. He played an important role in enhancing security and expanding the Organization’s work on economic and social development in poor countries. The United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Environment Programme were also initiated. U Thant believed that the United Nations needed to meet the needs and hopes of people everywhere. That vision is more relevant than ever to the work of the Organization and should guide us beyond the United Nations at 70.
During the tenure of the present Government, Myanmar has moved to raise its profile in the field of disarmament. We started with the signing of the Additional Protocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency in September 2013. That was followed by Myanmar’s ratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction in December 2014 and of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.
These actions demonstrate Myanmar’s dedicated commitment to the cause of disarmament. Every year Myanmar introduces a resolution on nuclear disarmament that is adopted with the support of a great majority of Member States. The resolution reflects our firm conviction that our world will be more secure and safer without nuclear weapons. As the main sponsor of the resolution, once again we invite all Member States to continue to support the resolution this year.
Peacekeeping has been one of the most effective tools available to the United Nations to assist countries struggling on their difficult path from conflict to peace. Today, the nature of conflicts is changing and becomes increasingly complex. We therefore welcome the Secretary-General’s timely efforts reviewing United Nations peace operations. At the same time, it is of paramount importance not to weaken the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter as well as the
12/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
cardinal principles of traditional peacekeeping of the United Nations.
Fifteen years ago, we gathered here and committed ourselves to fight against poverty. We set ambitious Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and targets. While we have lifted more than 1 billion people out of extreme poverty, some 800 million people are still excessively poor. Myanmar has made notable progress in poverty and hunger reduction, eliminating gender disparity in basic education, reducing the child mortality rate, improving maternal health and advancing a global partnership for development. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development this year will take over the unfinished business of the MDGs. Political commitment, enhanced partnership, the strengthening of capacity and the provision of adequate means of implementation will be keys to success in realizing ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Unilateral economic sanctions imposed on developing countries have a negative impact on their efforts on behalf of their people. They will also hinder the realization of the SDGs. We therefore call for the early lifting of such measures.
The world is experiencing shifting patterns of rainfall and snowfall, rising temperatures and heavy rainstorms. While we envisage a sustainable and resilient planet, scientific agencies agree that human activities are contributing to climate change. This is the time to translate commitments into action and not to argue. It is crucial that the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference reach a meaningful and universal climate change agreement keeping global warming below 2°C. It must also include obligations to provide the least developed countries with adequate and additional financial and technological resources to help address the impacts of climate change.
Migration definitely is not a new phenomenon. Myanmar shares the concerns expressed by many in this Hall about the migratiants in Europe and Asia. Saving lives on the journey, better legal migration policies, creating better opportunities at home and the suppression of people smuggling and trafficking networks are essential to addressing illegal migration everywhere. We strongly believe that economic migration and human trafficking must be urgently addressed in a comprehensive manner.
Let me turn to the state of affairs in my home country, Myanmar. Democratic reforms started in 2011.
The Government is now consolidating firm foundations for democracy. The reforms have widened the democratic space, advanced economic performance and narrowed differences with the non-State armed groups. A new political culture of dialogue has taken root as Myanmar opened its doors to different political forces since the early days of the reforms. Amnesties were granted on several occasions allowing former prisoners to take part in nation-building endeavours. Activists, media people, entrepreneurs and academicians living abroad have returned home. They are working hand in hand with the Government for the common goal of a peaceful and prosperous Myanmar. Unavoidably, there are still challenges typical of a young democracy, but we believe they are not insurmountable.
Economic sector reform has proven successful. Myanmar maintains an average growth rate of 8 per cent gross domestic product in a four-year time frame. Myanmar is aiming at graduating from the least developed countries (LDCs) group at an early date. That is feasible if we can maintain this average annual growth rate over the coming years. The framework for economic and social reforms launched in 2013 for sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction is a solid platform for our LDC graduation ambition. One International Monetary Fund evaluation is that economic prospects of Myanmar remain strong.
Myanmar is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country where freedom of religion is guaranteed in its State Constitution. The houses of worship of different faiths stand side by side across the country where different communities share the same neighbourhood. The situation in Rakhine state has changed. The Government has managed not only to prevent any new violence but has also started to promote a culture of peace through interfaith dialogue and talks among communities and their leaders. Peace and stability has been restored.
As I speak, more than 20 different aid organizations are providing humanitarian and other assistance in Rakhine state. We thank the regional and international partners for their kind assistance to humanitarian, resettlement, reintegration and development needs. The Interfaith Friendship Group in Myanmar has a nationwide set-up and is composed of representatives of all faiths. The Group holds monthly meetings and conveys messages of peace and harmony to the public. They also make religious site visits and provide assistance to the needy as necessary. Various civil
15-29822 13/29

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
society organizations are also playing their part in bridging different communities.
Peace is a prerequisite for national reconciliation and a cornerstone for building a new democratic society in Myanmar. Democracy will not flourish in the absence of peace. Without peace, economic development will not be sustained. In this strong conviction, President Thein Sein extended an olive branch to armed groups shortly after taking office with the aim of building sustainable and lasting peace in Myanmar.
Negotiations have been going on to determine the timing and modality for the signing of a nationwide ceasefire agreement. The Government, for its part, is fully prepared and patiently waiting for signature. We are hoping to sign the nationwide ceasefire agreement in the very near future. We will then continue discussions over the framework for a political dialogue. We appreciate the interest in and support of the international community for our peace process.
The promotion and protection of human rights have always been high on our agenda. Recent reforms in Myanmar have contributed to our people’s ability to better enjoy fundamental human rights and freedoms. The Myanmar National Human Rights Commission, first established in 2011, was reconstituted in line with the Paris Principles following the enactment of the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission Law in 2014.
Widening the space for people to express their views and opinions has been one of the most visible developments in Myanmar. Greater media freedom has been granted throughout the country by abolishing press censorship and permitting the publication of daily newspapers and weekly journals. Myanmar has also made significant progress in expanding the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.
Our signing of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in July 2015 and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict on 28 September was clear testimony to rising human rights standards in Myanmar.
Myanmar suffered a devastating natural disaster in late July and August in the wake of Cyclone Komen. The damage inflicted by floods and landslides from torrential rains this year is more intense and widespread than that of cyclone Nargis seven years ago.
We appreciate the kind assistance given to the affected people by friendly countries near and far, the United Nations and the international community.
This year, 2015, is vital for Myanmar as we will hold general elections on 8 November. The forthcoming elections will be transparent, free and fair. As such, the Government is working together with local stakeholders and international partners.
Over the past four and a half years, we have been able to enhance peace, stability and the rule of law and socioeconomic development in the country. Some may not be content with the pace of our reform process. However, it is undeniable that we have been able to create better political and socio-economic conditions, foster national reconciliation through a culture of dialogue, and expand space for civil societies in nation-building.
In closing, it is important to highlight that Myanmar’s democratic reform process is gaining momentum and moving in the right direction. The international community should continue its support to Myanmar in an objective and constructive manner. We shall remain fully committed and relentless in our efforts for peace, democracy and inclusive socio- economic development for the people of Myanmar.
"
70,2015,COG,"His Excellency Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the Republic of the Congo, has bestowed on me the great honour of representing him at the Assembly. On his behalf and on behalf of the delegation accompanying me, I would like to take this solemn opportunity to sincerely congratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I also pay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, for his leadership. I recognize Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon’s tireless commitment in guiding the affairs of the Organization, and I renew the indestructible support of my country, the Republic of the Congo, for his constant efforts to bring about a world characterized by peace, freedom, democracy and development for all.
In creating the United Nations, the founding fathers did not intend just to preserve future generations from the scourge of war, but also — and this is stated in the San Francisco Charter — to promote social progress and better standards of life for the multitude.
In the past 70 years tremendous human progress, with spectacular scientific and technological advances in various areas, has opened up unexpected opportunities
for humankind. People everywhere have become thirsty for democracy and freedom. Many Bastilles have been stormed and the walls of totalitarianism have crumbled. There are many countries like mine that, since the beginning of the 1960s, have been able to enjoy their inalienable right to self-determination, shrugging off the yoke of colonialism and joining the large family of the free, right here in the concert of nations. The emergence of new Powers, a historic development of which we are privileged witnesses, has birthed a multipolar world. Since then, international cooperation has experienced a tremendous expansion through activities in varied areas.
Over the past 70 years, humankind has not experienced tragedy on the scale of that of the Second World War. This long period of peace since 1945 — quite similar to that which began following the famous Congress of Vienna in 1815, two centuries ago, and which lasted until the start of the First World War — is owed largely to the United Nations, the Organization that has often served as a catalyst and central forum for harmonizing the efforts of peace loving nations. When we draw up the balance sheet of the last 70 years, it can be said that the United Nations has more than kept its promise and given proof, if proof were needed, of how much it is needed and how relevant it is to history.
My country, the Republic of the Congo, welcomes the resumption of relations between Cuba and the United States. We believe that this easing of relations between the two countries goes in the direction of history. My country’s Government fervently hopes that this courageous and thoughtful process will lead fairly quickly to the lifting of the economic embargo that has had a stranglehold on the Cuban people for far too long. We call on that generous humanism that the American people have demonstrated in crucial periods of history, such as during the Second World War.
My country, the Republic of the Congo, welcomes the recent conclusion of the Iranian nuclear agreement because it represents a further step towards a world free of destructive arsenals, indeed towards a world of peace.
Along with this inarguable progress, we cannot ignore the weaknesses that have often characterized the actions of our Organization and that sometimes have reduced its ability to influence the course of events. We still have not managed to ward off the spectre of war or all forms of armed conflict — conflicts often fuelled by non-State actors, by nebulous networks that
38/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
feed terrorism, by widely dispersed small groups that take religious proselytise to extremes, by reckless drug cartels or by pirates of misery who plunder the waterways.
Climate change and its dangerous repercussions for the environment, endemic poverty, migration crises, inequalities between States and within States, to stick with iconic and contemporary examples, are today real threats to the stability of States and world peace. Central Africa, the region that I hail from, has not been spared by these plagues, in view of the attacks by the Lord’s Resistance Army and the unspeakable atrocities committed in Nigeria, the Niger, Cameroon and Chad by the sadly infamous sect called Boko Haram. Given the gravity of this new genre of terrorist threat, the States of the region have recognized the need to oppose it with a common response, which is why we in the Economic Community of Central African States have mobilized to fight that irredentist, terrorist and sectarian organization. To this worrying picture we might add the ongoing tensions in Mali and South Sudan, which continue despite the signing of several peace agreements.
With respect to the Central African Republic, His Excellency Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, as is well known, is steadfastly leading the international mediation in the crisis that this brotherly country has been facing for many years. The national reconciliation forum held in Bangui in May resulted in findings that demonstrate the willingness of Central Africans to turn the page on the recurrent crises that have marked the history of their country.
However, their legitimate aspiration for peace remains subject to the successful conclusion of the electoral process, for which the support of the international community as a whole remains necessary if we want to see that country achieve the transition, token of lasting stability, before 31 December. Unfortunately, the painful events of recent days, which have been punctuated with unheard-of violence, could jeopardize all the efforts to help the country recover lasting peace and stability. The serious incidents that shook Bangui recently and the recurrence of intercommunal violence can only reinforce the widely shared impression that the transition process as it stands today remains fragile. That is why our commitment to that country is so highly sought after.
In this decisive phase of the transition process, President Denis Sassou Nguesso, international mediator
of the crisis, is dedicated more deeply than ever to his mission. With the support of all partners, he will spare no effort to meet the Central African Republic’s innumerable challenges, almost all of which can be characterized as a high priority or an emergency.
I would like to pay tribute to the international community for the ongoing commitment of the International Contact Group, and also salute the tireless efforts of all the peacekeeping forces deployed in Central African Republic since the beginning of the crisis, first in the framework of the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic, then under the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic, then under Operation Sangaris, and finally under the European Union-led peacekeeping force. At the same time, I wish to salute the memory of all the brave soldiers who have sacrificed their lives for the sake of peace and international solidarity.
Peace and stability, both at the national and international levels, as we know well, cannot be effective without a minimum of economic development that benefits the greatest number of people, especially in developing countries. As we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of our Organization, the adoption a few days ago of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) is in all respects a decisive step in building the brighter future we want for our planet, for our people, for posterity.
By establishing an effective strategy for funding and planning for sustainable development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, adopted in July at the third International Conference on Financing for Development, puts us squarely on track for cooperation for development for all. The Republic of the Congo completely aligns itself with this viewpoint and hopes to see significant progress in the implementation of that comprehensive new programme.
My country is among those that have a national strategy for sustainable development, which is an essential instrument for strategic planning. It is also one of those countries where the practice of democracy is being consolidated and strengthened every day, in particular through a continuous process of regular citizen consultations between opposition and majority parties, with a view to peaceful elections.
With the peace and stability it enjoys, and aware that sport contributes to the promotion of education, health,
15-29816 39/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
development and peace, our Government successfully organized, from 4 to 19 July 2015, the eleventh All- Africa Games, of which our capital Brazzaville is the historic birthplace.
At the 2005 World Summit our senior leaders clearly expressed their decision to see the United Nations reformed, starting with its spearhead, the Security Council. That decision demonstrates the steadfast collective will to put our Organization in a new historic perspective. We firmly believe that the United Nations vitally needs greater transparency, justice, equality and internal democracy, while strictly respecting the sovereign equality the dignity of each State. By defining and adopting a common position in the framework of the Ezulwini Consensus, Africa has clearly shown the way for the necessary reform that it resolutely calls for.
The Republic of the Congo here solemnly renews its commitment to the United Nations, in the footsteps of the founding fathers and in accordance with the Preamble of the Charter. On behalf of the Republic of the Congo, I exhort the community of nations gathered here to consolidate its efforts more than ever to definitively make manifest the noble ideals of freedom and equality, justice and peace, solidarity among peoples and human generosity.
"
70,2015,JOR,"It is an honour to stand before the General Assembly. I am here representing Jordan as a God-fearing and God-loving human being. I am here as a father who wants his children, like all others, to live in a compassionate and more peaceful world.
Such a future is under serious threat from the khawarij, the outlaws of Islam, who operate globally today. They target religious differences, hoping to kill cooperation and compassion among the billions of people of all faiths and communities, who live side by side in our many countries. Those outlaw gangs use suspicion and ignorance to expand their own power. And worse still is the free hand they grant themselves to distort the word of God in order to justify the most atrocious of crimes.
All of us here are united by our conviction that those forces must be defeated. But before we ask how to achieve that objective, let us ask the following. What if they were not defeated? What would our world look like? Can we tolerate a future where mass murder, public beheadings, kidnapping and slavery are common practices? Where the persecution of communities is the law? Where humankind’s cultural treasures that have
been preserved for thousands of years are systematically destroyed?
I have called this crisis a third world war, and I believe we must respond with equal intensity. That means global collective action on all fronts. But let us make no mistake; the more important war is the one we wage on the battlegrounds of the heart, the soul and the mind. And, in this fight, all countries and all people must come together.
Jordan has been proud to work with Member States and their countries to spearhead global initiatives for tolerance and dialogue. That has been reflected in the Amman Message and A Common Word, and, four years ago, we helped to initiate the World Interfaith Harmony Week, an annual United Nations event to focus all people, especially young people, on the essentials of tolerance and coexistence. Those efforts must continue, and the United Nations has a central role. But all of us, as individuals and as leaders, must help build the road ahead. Let me suggest seven essential steps.
First, let us get back to basics and to the essence and shared spirit of our respective faiths and creeds. It seems to me that we can sometimes lose sight of the larger picture. What separates human beings is minuscule, compared to what we hold in common: deep values of love, peace, justice and compassion.

“And My mercy embraces all things.” (The Holy Koran, VII:156)

Secondly, let us change our tone. On my travels not long ago, I saw a roadside sign that said, “Fear God”. A few miles down the road, was another, saying the same thing, then another and then a final one, saying, “... Or you will go to Hell”, and I asked myself when and how did fear and intimidation creep so insidiously into our conversations, when there is so much more to be said about the love of God. Most people may think they have nothing to do with the hate expressed by extremists. But our world is also threatened when violence, fear and anger dominate our discourse, whether in school lessons, weekly sermons or international affairs.
Thirdly, let us act upon our beliefs. And here, I mean more than praying, fasting or zakat — giving alms. I mean integrating our values into every part of our daily lives and every hour of every day. By loving our neighbour, showing respect to those different from
us and being kind to our own children, each one of us can do something to reflect the spirit of our Creator.
Fourthly, let us amplify the voice of moderation. It is one of the greatest ironies of our time that extremist voices use advanced media to propagate ignorant ideas. We must not let our screens, airwaves, broadband and social media be monopolized by those who pose the greatest danger to our world. We too must populate our media and, more important, the minds of our young people, with the purity and power of moderation.
Fifthly, let us recognize deceit. When we examine the motives of those outlaws, the khawarij, and, indeed, the motives of extremists on all sides, we find hunger for power, control of people, of money and of land. They use religion as a mask. Is there a worse crime than twisting God’s word to promote one’s own interests? Is there a more despicable act than feeding on the vulnerable and innocent, to recruit them to one’s ranks? In the global Muslim community — 1.7 billion good men and women, one quarter of humankind — today’s outlaw gangs are nothing but a drop in the ocean. But a drop of venom can poison a well. We must protect the purity of our faith from worldly contamination. As Muslims, this is our fight, as it is our duty.
Sixthly, by all means, let us be intolerant of intolerance. Extremists rely on the apathy of moderates. But moderation does not mean accepting those who trample on others and rejecting all those who differ. Today’s global fight is not between peoples, communities or religions. It is between all moderates of all faiths against all extremists, in all religions. Leaders of every country, every belief and every neighbourhood need to take a clear and public stand against intolerance of any kind. That includes respecting all places where God is worshipped, whether mosque, church, synagogue or temple.
And nothing can be more important and can have more impact in framing this respect and coexistence than Jerusalem. The Hashemite custodianship of Jerusalem’s Islamic and Christian holy sites is a sacred duty, and we join Muslims and Christians everywhere in rejecting threats to the holy places and the Arab character of that Holy City.
Lastly, there is hyperconnectivity. In our era, connectivity defines how we live and interact in our work, our communities, our schools and our lives. Only a few years ago, we were introduced to the Internet of computers; now, we talk about the Internet
of things. But over them all must be the Internet of humankind — a hyperconnection, bringing us together in collective consciousness and common cause. By gathering here today, we acknowledge that the power of working together far exceeds any individual effort. Our great General Assembly must address urgent world issues: sustainable and inclusive development that can deliver more opportunities, especially to young people, and peaceful, political solutions to regional crises.
It is the world’s obligation to find solutions and provide relief for the millions of refugees in my region. Today, we are still facing huge shortfalls, cuts and threats to vital United Nations programmes and agencies, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food Programme.
Today, we are haunted by the images of thousands of refugees on the shores and borders of Europe, seeking hope, far away from their homeland. In Jordan, we have been faced with that challenge since the beginning of the Syrian crisis. Today, Syrian refugees alone constitute 20 per cent of my country’s population.
We have been relieving the international community of a significant part of the burden of that humanitarian disaster since the beginning. Support to our country has been a small fraction of the cost we have endured. It is high time for the international community to act collectively in facing this unprecedented humanitarian crisis and to provide support to countries such as Jordan and Lebanon, which have been carrying the brunt of that burden over the past four years.
In all these areas, we must act, and act collectively, for the future of our world. And connectivity is key. The values we share — equality, compassion and hope — need to be connected to everything we do. And we must keep ourselves connected to each other, for the good of all. These bonds are the power and promise of our United Nations. Here, together, we can and must create the future our people need — a safer, stronger world of coexistence, inclusion, shared prosperity and peace. Seven steps can bring us closer to our destination. God willing, our countries and peoples will achieve those seven steps and many more."
70,2015,FSM,"From this rostrum, many great leaders of nations have spoken with great eloquence and conviction on matters of great import to their own nation in particular and also to other nations in general. And in this Hall, we speak with the confident hope that what we say here will not only be heard, but that it will give relevance to our efforts and make a positive difference.
Today, I stand before the Assembly as the President of a small Pacific island country to reinforce our commitment to save the difference that we represent, while participating in the noble attempt to bring nations together and speak on subjects of mutual concern and benefit to all. Some who saw my remarks for this morning tell me that they are generic and expound no particular issue of controversy that might generate murmurs in the Hall. They may be right. But that is only because most of them do not live by the sea, at sea level and surrounded by the great Pacific Ocean, where we listen to the sound of the waves relentlessly pounding on our islands, getting dangerously closer with every successive wave.
I will speak first on the much-debated issue of climate change and its causes and effects on many small island States including my own, Micronesia, but I will not go into details, because that is where the Devil is said to be king. I speak as an islander who has walked the shores of many atoll islands in the Pacific. Where there once were sandy beaches and coconut trees, now there are none. I am told that that will continue. As islanders, we wonder why that is happening. Parents today show their children where their island used to extend in relation to the reefs offshore.
While we wait in fear for the predicted and inevitable sea-level rise, other effects of global warming, like stronger ocean currents and more frequent typhoons, continue to wash away shorelines and topple trees, not waiting for the sea to rise and drown the island. People who live on these islands hear that some of the causes of sea-level rise have been identified, that much debate has gone into validating these causes, and that there is now a general understanding and agreement on its causes. They have also heard that there is a way to slow down and eventually save what is left of their islands. That is good news to them and, with the simplicity of islanders, they think — we think — this will be done sooner rather than later. This is their hope. Our hope is in the hands of Member States. I want to believe that many of us are here today to give this hope a chance.
15-29658 9/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
I am encouraged that our ongoing discussions on climate change, and the ones that will take place later, will usher in a more serious tone and be conducted more speedily, and that the matter has captured the interest of Member States. We are thankful for that. It gives us hope, as we look forward to the meeting in Paris. We have set our hopes on Paris as the venue for the final stretch of dialogue on how we close the gap of disagreement over the level of emissions allowed by our friends, the industrialized States Members of the United Nations. We must become more cohesive in our actions to reach a useful agreement that would help mitigate the threat of sinking islands and prevent the potential genocide of oceanic peoples and their cultures.
The next topic I would like to address is that of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). What do the Federated States of Micronesia, the Montreal Protocol and HFCs have in common? In 1995, the Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia passed a bill that approved the country’s accession to the Montreal Protocol. In 2009, the Federated States of Micronesia made the first proposal for an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down HFCs, which are powerful greenhouse gases, as everyone knows. The Federated States of Micronesia took the lead among developing countries to promote the phase-down as a complementary climate change action. Thanks to island countries, the solidarity of our African nation friends and the endorsement of the European Union, over 100 countries have called for these products, HFCs, to be phased down. Now the parties to the Protocol are finally converging towards an agreement on a mandate to negotiate an HFC phase-down. The Federated States of Micronesia will continue to work with other supporters and with all parties until an amendment to phase down HFCs is adopted. I ask the Assembly to join me in this effort.
I note, with great joy, that President Obama is putting his weight behind this move. This is like manna from heaven. Just last week, President Obama and President Xi agreed on “stepping up their work to phase down super-polluting” HFCs. With President Obama’s help, we now see that China, India and Brazil have indicated their support for the HFC amendment. Nonetheless, their indication of support alone is not enough. They must do something about that indication. May President Obama be blessed many times for his leadership in this particular area. How true that the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. The benevolence of good leaders raises the hope of islanders that people still care. This is important to the
Pacific peoples. They take great comfort in the thought that they are no longer alone in their crusade in this area. I recall that Pope Francis did not forget to remind us of the golden rule — do unto others as you would they do unto you.
Our second strategy on climate change is quite simple. We are going to Paris, and we are going to support the issues that are raised in order to gain ground on the topic of climate-change mitigation. In Micronesia, we have a challenge called the Micronesian Challenge. Micronesia is a sprinkling of islands that span an ocean area that is larger than the continent of the United States and larger than the European Union. It is made up of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, the territory of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas and my own Federated States of Micronesia. These entities have established what is now the Micronesian Challenge. It is a bold undertaking by small island countries to save our planet. We are agreeing to set aside 30 per cent of near-shore marine areas and 20 per cent of terrestrial areas as our dedicated contribution to the efforts of the people of this Earth to save the planet. We invite those who care and can to join us in this effort to contribute to the well-being of our planet.
When in the General Assembly Hall, I cannot help but feel a greater sense of security and of empowerment. In that regard, I would like to touch on the subject of peace and freedom — peace as an aftermath of hostilities, not just of armed conflict, but hostilities of silence, tolerance and apathy. When we speak of peace, you and I will always remember the absence of it. For the people of Micronesia, the first four decades of the past century will always be remembered as a period of armed conflict — a conflict in which Micronesians had no interest and no part. Those of us from Micronesia and our neighbouring Pacific islands who suffered similarly have our deep subscription to peace engraved in our hearts and inscribed in our governing constitutions. We believe that peace should be universal and embraced by all of us who have decided to be Members of the United Nations.
While we accept that universal peace may be a distant goal, it must be sought vigorously and with determined haste. When I speak of the precious issue of peace, I am often reminded of a statement by a man whose nation had just come out of war and which expressed his dream for lasting peace. President Wilson said of the League of Nations that
10/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
“a general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike ... An evident principle runs through the whole program I have outlined. It is the principle of justice to all people and nationalities, and their right to live on equal terms of liberty and safety with one another, whether they be strong or weak”.
Today, we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. Some nations celebrate the anniversary of an end to war. While those of us who call the Pacific our home rejoice in the silence of guns, we are not happy that, elsewhere, innocent people continue to fear for their lives and lose precious property, and are forced to confront the ugly face of apathy. Today, many nations have risen from the debris of war to become dominant economic Powers in the world. Many have been generous and supportive to those who have been plundered.
While many postwar territories and possessions have since attained a negotiated political freedom and independence, they still see the shadow of foreign flags fluttering over their lands and their affairs. Some are still labouring to improve their status as nations, while others still await the awakening of the United Nations in hopes that it will heed their plea for political autonomy and the honour of flying a flag of independence. As for our friends who fought against each other in armed conflicts, we ask them to stand together with us today and let us resolve to remember war as a painful conflict of the past. Some things are hard to forget, and the pains of war may be one of them.
For the sake of a peaceful tomorrow, however, let us forgive. Together let us promote friendship, partnership, and cooperation as our collective strength for the future. We have enough common enemies today, enemies that have no respect for culture, boundaries, religion or social status. They are climate change, sea-level rise, poverty, hunger and famine, illiteracy, incurable diseases, domestic violence, genocide and human trafficking, economic imbalance and apathy. Those are our challenges today. We must bind together our efforts to address them. I ask that we divert the energy of our anger over things past to dealing with these challenges in order to achieve a better tomorrow. Let us resolve to work together, more effectively, to overcome these issues, which have been produced by
man’s own doing. Let us take strength and wisdom from our past and apply it for the good of humankind. Let us forgive, for that is the strength we have as the United Nations. Let us create a spirit of unity to enable us to find the necessary strength for our united nations to work well together. Let us celebrate that unity today.
"
70,2015,CHN,"Just 70 years ago, an earlier generation fought heroically and secured victory in an anti-fascist war, thereby ending a dark chapter in the annals of human history. That victory was hard won. Seventy years ago, humankind, acting with vision and foresight, established the United Nations. That universal and most representative and authoritative international Organization has carried humankind’s hope for a new future and ushered in a new 
era of cooperation. It was a pioneering initiative never undertaken before. Seventy years ago, that generation pooled their wisdom to adopt the Charter of the United Nations, laying the cornerstone for the contemporary international order and establishing the fundamental principles of contemporary international relations. It was an achievement of profound impact.
On 3 September, the Chinese people, together with other peoples of the world, solemnly commemorated the seventieth anniversary of the Chinese people’s war of resistance against Japanese aggression and fascism in the Second World War. In the main theatre in the East, China made a national sacrifice, suffering over 35 million casualties in its fight against the main troops of Japanese militarism. China not only saved itself and its people from subjugation, but also gave strong support to the forces fighting aggression in the European and Pacific theatres, thereby making a historic contribution to the victory in that anti-fascist world war.
History is like a mirror. Only by drawing on the lessons of history can the world avoid repeating past calamities. We should review history with respect and in full conscience. The past cannot be changed, but the future can be shaped. Bearing history in mind is not to perpetuate hatred. Rather, it is necessary so that humankind does not forget history’s lessons. Remembering history does not mean being obsessed with the past; rather, in doing so, we aim to create a better future and pass the torch of peace from generation to generation.
The United Nations has survived the test of time. Over the past seven decades, it has witnessed the efforts of all countries to uphold peace, build homelands and pursue cooperation. Having reached a historic new starting point, the United Nations needs to address the central issue of how to better promote world peace and development in the twenty-first century. The world is experiencing a historic process of accelerated evolution. The sunshine of peace, development and progress will be powerful enough to penetrate the clouds of war, poverty and backwardness. The movement towards a multipolar world and the rise of emerging markets and developing countries have become an irreversible historical trend. Economic globalization with the advent of the information age has unleashed and greatly boosted social productive forces that have both created unprecedented development opportunities and given rise to new threats and challenges that we must squarely face.
As an ancient Chinese goes, “Our greatest ideal is to create a world truly shared by all”. Peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom are the common values of humankind and the lofty goals of the United Nations. Yet those goals are far from having been achieved, and we must continue our endeavours to meet them. In today’s world, all countries are interdependent and share a common future. We should renew our commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, so as to fashion a new kind of international relations with win-win cooperation at its core and to create an international community that realizes a shared positive future for all of humankind. To achieve that goal, we need to make the following efforts.
We should build partnerships in which countries treat each other as equals, engage in mutual consultation and show mutual understanding. The principle of sovereign equality underpins the Charter of the United Nations. The future of the world must be shaped by all countries. All countries are equals. Those who are big, strong and rich should not bully the small, weak and poor. The principle of sovereignty not only means that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries are inviolable and that their internal affairs are not subject to interference. It also means that the right of all countries to independently choose social systems and development paths should be upheld and that the endeavours of all countries to promote economic and social development and to improve their people’s lives should be respected.
We should be committed to multilateralism and reject unilateralism. We should adopt a new vision of seeking win-win outcomes for all and reject the outdated mindset that one’s gain means the other’s loss or that the winner takes all. Consultation is an important form of democracy, and it should also become an important means of exercising contemporary international governance. We should resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultation. We should forge a global partnership at both the international and regional levels, and embrace a new approach to State-to-State relations, one that features dialogue rather than confrontation and seeks partnership rather than alliance.
Major countries should follow the principles of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation in handling their relations. Big countries should treat small countries as equals and take the right
approach to justice and interests by putting justice before interests.
We should create a security architecture featuring fairness, justice, joint contributions and shared benefits. In an age of economic globalization, the security of all countries is interlinked and has a mutual impact. No country can maintain absolute security by its own efforts alone, and no country can achieve stability on the basis of other countries’ instability. The law of the jungle leaves the weak at the mercy of the strong; that is not the way for countries to conduct their relations. Those who adopt the high-handed approach of using force will find that they are only lifting a rock to drop it on their own feet.
We should abandon the Cold War mentality in all its manifestations and foster a new vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We should give full play to the central role of the United Nations and its Security Council in ending conflict and keeping peace, and adopt the dual approach of seeking peaceful solutions to disputes and taking the actions required to turn hostility into amity.
We should advance international cooperation in both the economic and social fields and take a holistic approach to addressing traditional and non-traditional security threats, so as to prevent conflicts from breaking out in the first place.
We should promote open, innovative and inclusive development that benefits all. The 2008 international financial crisis taught us that allowing capital to blindly pursue profit can only create a crisis and that global prosperity cannot be built on the shaky foundation of a market without moral constraints. The growing gap between rich and poor is both unsustainable and unfair. It is important for us to use both the invisible hand and the visible hand to create synergy between market forces and Government function and strive to achieve both efficiency and fairness.
Development is meaningful only when it is inclusive and sustainable. Achieve this goal requires openness, mutual assistance and win-win cooperation. In today’s world, close to 800 million people still live in extreme poverty; nearly 6 million children die before the age of 5 each year; and nearly 60 million children are unable to go to school. The just-concluded United Nations sustainable development Summit adopted the post-2015 development Agenda (resolution 70/1). We must translate our commitments into action and work
together to ensure a bright future in which everyone is free from want, has access to development and lives with dignity.
We should increase inter-civilization exchanges so as to promote harmony, inclusiveness and respect for differences. The world is simply more colourful as a result of its cultural diversity. Diversity breeds exchanges, exchanges create integration, and integration makes progress possible. In their interactions, civilizations must accept their differences. Only through mutual respect, mutual learning and harmonious coexistence can the world maintain its diversity and thrive. Each civilization reflects the unique vision and contribution of its people, and no civilization is superior to any other. Different civilizations should have dialogue and exchanges instead of trying to exclude or replace one another. The history of humankind is a process of active exchanges, interactions and integration among different civilizations. We should respect all civilizations and treat one another as equals. We should draw inspiration from one another to boost the creative development of human civilization.
We should build an ecosystem that puts Mother Nature and green development first. Humankind may utilize nature and even try to transform it, but we are, after all, a part of it. We should care for nature and not place ourselves above it. We should reconcile industrial development with nature and pursue harmony between man and nature to achieve the sustainable development of the world and the all-round development of humankind.
To build a sound ecology is vital for humankind’s future. All members of the international community should work together to build a sound global eco-environment. We should respect nature, follow nature’s ways and protect nature. We should firmly pursue green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable development. China will shoulder its share of responsibility and continue to play its part in this common endeavour. We also urge developed countries to fulfil their historical responsibilities, honour their emission-reduction commitments and help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change.
The more than 1.3 billion Chinese people are endeavouring to realize the Chinese dream of great national renewal. The dream of the Chinese people is closely connected with the dreams of the other peoples of the world. We cannot realize the Chinese dream without a peaceful international environment, a stable
international order and the understanding, support and help of the rest of the world. The realization of the Chinese dream will bring more opportunities to other countries and contribute to global peace and development.
China will continue to participate in building world peace. We are committed to peaceful development. No matter how the international landscape may evolve and how strong China may become, China will never seek hegemony or expansion or to establish a sphere of influence. We will continue to contribute to global development and to pursue common development and the win-win strategy of opening up. We are ready to share our development experience and opportunities with other countries, and we invite other countries to board China’s express train of development, so that all of us will achieve common development.
China will continue to uphold the international order. We will stay committed to the path of peaceful development through cooperation. China was the first country to put its signature on the Charter of the United Nations. We will continue to uphold the international order and system, underpinned by the purposes and principles of the Charter. China will continue to stand together with other developing countries. We firmly support the greater representation and voice of developing countries, especially African countries, in the international governance system. In voting at the United Nations, China will always side with the developing countries.
I take this opportunity to announce China’s decision to establish a 10-year, $1 billion peace and development fund to support the work of the United Nations, advance multilateral cooperation and promote world peace and development. I also wish to announce that China will join the new United Nations peacekeeping capabilities readiness system and has therefore decided to take the lead in setting up a permanent formed peacekeeping police force and a standby peacekeeping force of 8,000 troops. I also wish to announce that China will provide a total of $100 million of free military assistance to the African Union over the next five years to support the establishment of the African Standby Force and the development of the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crisis.
As the United Nations enters a new decade, let us unite even more closely to forge a new partnership of win-win cooperation and a community of shared future for humankind. Let the vision of beating our swords
into ploughshares and building a war-free world with lasting peace take root in our hearts. Let the aspirations for development, prosperity, fairness and justice spread throughout the world."
70,2015,NLD,"It is a privilege to address the General Assembly on behalf of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a Kingdom made up of four autonomous countries — the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao and Saint Maarten — rooted in both Europe and the Caribbean.
In 1945, the Charter of the United Nations was signed by representatives of 51 countries. Today, 70 years later, there are three times as many people on the Earth and four times as many Member States, with all the complexities that that entails. And yet, as an international Organization, the United Nations stands proud. In those 70 years, the world has seen great upheavals and shifts in the balance of power. Technological advances have changed our daily lives faster and more dramatically than ever before, and yet, the United Nations endures. We have seen clashes of interests, bitter conflicts and human tragedies, which, indeed, persist today. As we speak, the lives of millions are still dominated by fear, oppression and want. And yet, the United Nations lives on as a legitimate platform for international dialogue where countries can always come together, no matter how great their differences.
The United Nations is more than simply a platform. It is an Organization whose activities help to shape and improve our world. Thanks in part to the United Nations, extreme poverty has been halved, child mortality has been halved, 2.3 billion people have gained access to drinking water, diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis have been beaten back, and peace operations in many areas have brought violent conflicts under control. That is all because of the
work of millions of courageous people in the Member States and the untiring efforts of the staff of the United Nations and its organs, both here in New York and all over the world. So I would like to say to the United Nations: congratulations! I thank it for 70 years of battling against cynicism and fatalism.
For the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the United Nations is and will remain the primary global Organization for peace, justice and development. That is why the Kingdom is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2017-2018 term.
Of course, the world is far from perfect. It is still filled with terrible injustice and human suffering. But we have also made great progress. What would today’s world look like without the United Nations? There can be no doubt that we would be worse off. The Kingdom of the Netherlands feels a close bond with the fundamentals of the United Nations, as laid down in the Charter of the United Nations. We understand the value of diversity and dialogue. This goes hand in hand with the conviction that multilateral cooperation can help us move forward and make the world stronger.
We owe our freedom to other countries. Seventy years ago our allies made enormous sacrifices in liberating the Netherlands. They enabled us to rise again and become a prosperous Kingdom. We will never forget the importance of international solidarity. The world will always be able to count on the Netherlands as a partner for peace, justice and development.
Yet, just as we remain deeply committed, we also believe in being critical when necessary. It is good, on this seventieth anniversary, for the United Nations to look openly and honestly at the results of its efforts, to look at the goals that have not been achieved and at the long and winding path that lies ahead. Our Kingdom is gravely concerned about the lawlessness, terror and contempt for basic human rights that are gaining ground in some areas. Millions of desperate people have been displaced and forced to flee the violence. They are the innocent victims of intolerance and of despicable conduct on the part of tyrants they cannot constrain. Many refugees have been in a desperate situation for too long. The positive effects of years of work on sustainable development are at risk, and this affects us all. We cannot look the other way.
We are all deeply touched by the tragic images of families who have had to leave everything behind in their search for a safe haven. All the world’s nations
must show solidarity in the face of the refugee crisis. The Kingdom of the Netherlands has again increased its contribution to humanitarian assistance, making it one of the largest donors in the world. We call on other nations to follow suit and give additional support to the United Nations, so that it can provide food and shelter to all those who have been forced to flee and give them a chance to rebuild their lives.
It is crucial that we make our joint efforts on peace and security more efficient and effective. The review by the High-level Independent Panel on United Nations Peace Operations is a helpful tool in that regard.
Since the United Nations was founded, the Kingdom of the Netherlands has participated in 63 United Nations or United Nations-mandated missions in more than 30 countries. Those missions have involved more than 125,000 Dutch military and civilian personnel. Earlier this year, I visited the Dutch men and women who are part of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. The situation there clearly illustrates how complex the problems in conflict areas often are. You cannot build lasting peace by military means alone. A political solution has to be found. It is equally important to strengthen the institutions that safeguard respect for the rule of law and to remove the underlying causes of conflict.
The lack of decent prospects or equal opportunities drives many young people into the arms of ruthless terrorist organizations. Discrimination and exclusion are the root of much evil in the world. That is why we need a three-dimensional approach: a combination of defence, development and diplomacy, of which the Netherlands has many years of experience. For example, we have made it a top priority to stimulate job creation in Africa and to assist young African entrepreneurs, and we are increasing our support for programmes to promote stability in fragile States.
The Kingdom of the Netherlands is proud to be home to the International Court of Justice, the only principal organ of the United Nations located outside New York. The Hague is the place where global peace, justice and security are defended by a range of international organizations, including the International Criminal Court and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
A key feature of a legal order is the absence of impunity. Violence must never be allowed to prevail. Lawlessness must never become the norm. Anyone
who strives for justice will find our Kingdom on their side. Injustice hurts like an open wound. Hundreds of families from 10 countries, including Malaysia, Australia and the Netherlands, still grieve every day for the loved ones they lost in the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 air disaster. They await the results of Security Council resolution 2166 (2014). That resolution is very clear: it demands that those responsible for this incident be held to account and that all States cooperate fully with efforts to establish accountability. The Dutch Government will work tirelessly, together with all the countries and organizations concerned, until justice is done with regard to this tragedy.
Peace, justice and development are closely linked. They are a trinity, as tied to each other as the blades on a windmill. To achieve lasting progress, all three are essential. So our Kingdom welcomes the Sustainable Development Goals, which will focus the efforts of the international community over the next 15 years. And we will put our hearts and souls into helping ensure their success.
There is still not enough focus on the positive role that women can play. Even in the harshest and most hopeless circumstances, women often have the strength to go on and to find practical ways to improve the lives of their families and communities. Promoting equal rights and opportunities for women is actually sustainable development in action. Any organization that wants to remain relevant must adapt to new times and circumstances. It is especially important for institutions that stand for shared values and continuity to critically examine their own performance and to ask themselves: “Are our working methods still appropriate?” Without such self-reflection they risk the gradual erosion of their relevance and effectiveness.
For the United Nations and the Security Council this has, after 70 years, become an urgent issue. The Security Council needs to be able to act more boldly in the face of large-scale atrocities. Greater restraint in the use of vetoes would help. We warmly welcome France’s initiative in that regard. The Council’s legitimacy is also under pressure. If part of the global population feels insufficiently represented by it, the Security Council cannot properly fulfil its primary role as a global body for safeguarding peace and security and for resolving conflicts. Africa, in particular, is underrepresented, but the voices of other regions and countries are not being heard enough either. This needs to change.
The Kingdom of the Netherlands believes in the power of empathy and dialogue. It is not always the loudest voices that speak the deepest truths. In fact, it is often the small Member States that show us the way forward. One example is the longtime plea by small island States for a far more active global approach to climate change and marine pollution. They feel the urgency like no other. Fortunately — finally — more and more large countries are developing concrete action plans.
The Kingdom of the Netherlands knows how crucial this is. Three of our countries — Aruba, Curaçao and Saint Maarten — are small island States, and three other Caribbean islands are special municipalities of the Netherlands. With its centuries of water-management experience, the Netherlands is one of the best-protected deltas in the world, investing billions to help mitigate the effects of climate change. That is why we intend to make sure our voice is heard at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris later this year, and we will continue pressing for cleaner oceans.
Our guiding principle is simple — consider the interests of all countries, large and small. Forget might is right. We believe right is might. This also forms the basis of our candidacy for a seat on the Security Council for the 2017-2018 term. We are passionate about serving the entire international community at the United Nations level as a partner for peace, justice and development.
For my wife and me, this has a very personal significance. For seven years I had the honour of being the Chair of the Secretary-General’s Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation. My wife remains his Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development. Two years ago, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke at the centennial celebrations of the Peace Palace in The Hague. He said, “Here in The Hague, you help sustain and expand the rule of law. You bring the rule of law to life.” We took those warm words not merely as a great compliment, but also as an inspirational challenge, a solemn task, which we aim to continue fulfilling, together with all Member States in The Hague, in New York and all over the world."
70,2015,KWT,"At the outset, on behalf of the Government and the people of Kuwait, I extend our sincere congratulations to the President of the General Assembly and his country, the Kingdom of Denmark, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. We
44/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
believe that his vast experience in political affairs will enable him to conduct the deliberations of this session wisely and ably. We wish him success in that endeavour.
We also note the successful manner with which his predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, conducted the deliberations during the previous session. In that regard, I also would like to pay tribute to the tremendous efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in leading the Organization in accordance with his vision and ideas based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security, while simultaneously striving to achieve the Charter’s goals in a sustainable manner by confronting the manifold risks and challenges that are engulfing the world.
Once again, we express our most sincere condolences and heartfelt sympathy to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in connection with the stampede that resulted in numerous deaths and injuries at Mina during the Haj. While we pray to Allah, the Almighty, to accept the victims in His Grace and grant them eternal peace, and solace and fortitude to their bereaved families, we also pray for the speedy recovery of the injured. We appreciate and are grateful for the enormous human and material assets that the King, his Government and people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia make available every year to organize and facilitate the Haj and to provide every comfort to the pilgrims.
This year, the international community is celebrating 70 years of service by this great leading world Organization, during which it has worked to create a world in which humankind can enjoy peace and security during a period marked by exceptional circumstances — a period when the political, economic, social and humanitarian challenges in the world have increased. During that time, the United Nations has continued to provide its service in accordance with the aims and objectives of its Charter in order to surmount those growing challenges and confront them by creative means. Those undertakings have to a great extent become history to be taught to future generations in order to demonstrate the importance and inevitability of international cooperation and the capacity of the United Nations system to continue its boundless giving to the peoples and countries of the world.
Perhaps one of the most outstanding milestones on the path to the success of the United Nations is embodied in the adoption of the post-2015 development
goals in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (resolution 70/1), which can be considered to be an extension of the international community’s efforts based on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs have, by and large, achieved their purposes, and the United Nations has surpassed its goals in facing up to the challenges that it is confronted with, and has proceeded to implement comprehensive, radical solutions in the areas of human development and individual rights. That includes the goal of totally eliminating poverty in its multiple forms, ensuring that all human beings enjoy equal rights in dignity and access to education and health care, as well as ensuring political participation, gender equality, youth empowerment and addressing the ongoing environmental degradation.
In that regard, the State of Kuwait affirm its effective participation in the international partnership to fully implement the Sustainable Development Goals over the next 15 years. That is based on Kuwait’s firm belief in the Charter of the United Nations and on Kuwait’s support for the Organization. Kuwait will continue its funding in appreciation of the certificate of appreciation presented by the Secretary-General to Sheikh Al Sabah, the Amir of the State of Kuwait, as a humanitarian leader. That award is tantamount to a medal of honour for the leadership displayed by the Government and the people of Kuwait in saving the lives of millions of people. Indeed, Kuwait occupies first place in the provision of humanitarian assistance globally as a proportion of its gross national income, the highest percentage provided by a donor State, according to the Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2014.
Furthermore, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development continues its leading role in providing development assistance to developing countries, without any regard for geographical location, religious belief or nationality. Since its establishment, in 1961, more than 100 countries in all parts of the globe have benefited from the Fund’s projects, which total $18 billion. Over the next 15 years, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development will continue to provide loans and create development programmes within its operational programmes, which are based on its own resources, including $15 billion to meet the needs and requirements of sustainable development.
Undoubtedly, it is important for the international community to work to consolidate and promote the existence of peaceful societies that are based on

justice and are free from all manifestations of violence and radicalism. That confirms the principle that no sustainable development can take place without security, and no security can exist without sustainable development.
There has been a proliferation of conflicts and civil wars in our world today, accompanied by the emergence of violence and the dangers of radicalism and terrorism, with their multiple causes and employing diverse means in a number of countries, particularly in the region of the Middle East. It is civilians who make up the majority of the victims. The international community must stand up to those challenges, which threaten international peace and security; it must address their causes and dry up the resources that fuel them.
The Republic of Yemen and its brotherly people face serious challenges owing to the intransigence of the Houthi militias and their insistence on breaching their commitments and on threatening the security and stability of our region and our countries. That situation requires strong action to support the legitimate Government of Yemen and to achieve peace and stability in our region. We would like to emphasize the need to commit to the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative, comply with the outcome of the National Reconciliation Conference and respond to the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen in that regard. The State of Kuwait has not ignored the humanitarian needs of the Yemeni people. Kuwait announced, upon instructions from His Highness Sheikh Al-Sabah, the donation of $100 million to meet the needs of Yemen.
In Syria, as that disaster enters its fifth year, the scope of humanitarian suffering is exacerbating the multiple other parameters of the crisis. The number of dead and injured are rising, and the number of refugees and internally displaced persons continues to increase. The flow of Syrian migrants and refugees to Europe attests to the magnitude of the crisis. We have warned against the dire consequences of the situation on Syria, the Syrian people, their neighbours and the entire world. In view of the aforementioned, the State of Kuwait reiterates its firm and principled position, namely, that the solution to that disaster can be achieved only through peaceful, political means, as opposed to other means, whose price would be paid by our brothers in Syria. In that regard, we welcome the endeavours of the United Nations and those of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria, Mr. Staffan de Mistura,
which seek to mobilize efforts to implement the Geneva communiqué (S/2012/522, annex), issued in 2012, aimed at establishing a transitional Government that is fully functional, and at maintaining the territorial integrity of Syria, preserving the coherence of Syrian society and meeting the needs for dignity of the Syrian people.
Within the framework of supporting international efforts to alleviate the humanitarian suffering in Syria, since 2013 the State of Kuwait has hosted three successive international donor conferences to lend support to efforts to improve the situation in that country. The pledges made at those three conferences amounted to approximately $7.15 billion, of which the State of Kuwait contributed $1.3 billion. The bulk of the money pledged has been delivered to the United Nations specialized agencies and other international, governmental and non-governmental organizations in the humanitarian affairs field. The remainder of those contributions has been distributed through local charitable institutions working in the humanitarian and development fields.
With regard to the situation in Libya, we are closely following the agreement announced in the Moroccan city of Skhirat by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya, aimed at forming a national consensus Government that would put an end to the fighting. We look forward to a positive response to that initiative from our brothers in Libya, so that they can stop the bloodshed, preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their homeland and restore security and stability throughout Libya.
Our region faces exceptionally delicate dangers that threaten its security and stability. They stem from terrorist and violent groups that commit, supposedly in the name of Islam, criminal acts rejected by all religions. The brutal crimes committed by the so-called Daesh/Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant have spread death and destruction, particularly in Iraq and Syria, and are a threat to international peace and security. A much-needed international coalition has been formed to tackle those terrorists. The State of Kuwait took part in the establishment of the coalition by providing logistical support. The practices of that terrorist organization have extended to the State of Kuwait. Daesh committed a cowardly terrorist act, targeting a mosque during the holy month of Ramadan, which killed and injured a number of our citizens. The national unity and cohesion between the people and the leadership of Kuwait made those who wished Kuwait ill miss their mark, thereby

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
reaffirming a long, honourable national history that has witnessed floods of sacrifices for the sake of the unity and stability of the State of Kuwait.
In the humanitarian field, the State of Kuwait has also responded to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. Kuwait announced the donation of $200 million to assist our Iraqi brothers in alleviating the suffering caused by the brutal practices of the Daesh terrorist group. Work is ongoing to disburse that donation, in cooperation with the competent parties in Iraq and international organizations. We reaffirm our support for all the measures taken by the Iraqi Government to preserve the security, stability and territorial integrity of Iraq. In that regard, the State of Kuwait reiterates its firm and principled position rejecting all forms of terrorism, extremism and intolerance, irrespective of their causes or motives and whatever their sources or the identity of their perpetrators. Kuwait stresses that promoting a culture of tolerance and coexistence among peoples and nations is among the top priorities in the approach that it follows in its internal and external policies. Such policies are anchored in the tolerant Islamic sharia law and in the importance Kuwait attaches to maintaining the links between development, security and human rights, as it works to develop a global strategy to combat terrorism and achieve international peace and security.
The international and regional efforts that seek to lay the foundation for peace in the Middle East face many impediments as a result of Israel’s intransigence. Israel continues its illicit expansionist policies by building illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian territory and by detaining thousands of Palestinians in its prisons and detention centres. Its repeated acts of aggression, including the attack on Gaza during the past year, has left in its wake unprecedented destruction and loss of life and property. That is in addition to its continued imposition of an illegal and inhumane siege on Gaza, and the escalation of its attacks on the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque and Muslims there. Those attacks are in violation of all humanitarian standards, international laws and the relevant Security Council resolutions. That makes it incumbent upon the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, to carry out their responsibilities and continue to put pressure on and compel Israel, at all levels, to accept the resolutions of international legitimacy, grant the Palestinian people their legitimate political rights, and recognize their independent status and sovereignty over their territory,
with East Jerusalem as their capital, in accordance with the borders of 4 June 1967 and in line with the principle of land for peace, the Quartet’s road map and the Arab Peace Initiative.
In the same regional framework, the State of Kuwait welcomes Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), which endorsed the comprehensive agreement on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action concluded between the five permanent members of the Security Council, plus Germany, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The agreement was the result of diplomatic efforts over a number of years aimed at addressing the Iranian nuclear situation. The State of Kuwait hopes that the Islamic Republic of Iran will continue to cooperate and fully implement the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and adhere to its responsibilities under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the relevant Security Council resolutions. In addition, Kuwait hopes that Iran will respond to the efforts of the countries of the region to lay the foundations of good neighbourly relations based on cooperation, mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs, and that it will end its occupation of the three Emirati islands, all of which will contribute to reducing tensions and to security and stability in the region.
In that context, we call upon Israel to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and to subject all of its nuclear facilities to the inspection and supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in compliance with the resolution adopted at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, which called for the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the adherence of the State of Kuwait to the multilateral international system, as well as to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. I would like to underscore our belief in the importance and necessity of exerting all efforts to ensure the continuity and generosity of our great Organization through the fulfilment of all States’ obligations and responsibilities, as pledged in international conventions and conferences. That will, in turn, contribute to finding just and fair solutions to global threats and challenges, while according due attention to the higher goal of maintaining international peace and security.

70,2015,MRT,"It is an honour for me to deliver the statement of the President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, and to speak on his behalf.
“It gives me pleasure, on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, to extend to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft our warm congratulations and best wishes on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I am fully confident that his statesmanship, skills and long- standing experience is our best guarantee of success at this session.
“I should also like to express profound thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his great and tireless efforts in the service of international peace
and security and for his promotion of dialogue as an optimum means for addressing current global issues.
“Today, we meet 70 years after the establishment of our great Organization, and those seven decades have been spent in unabated pursuit of the noble goals for which it was founded. We should congratulate ourselves on the achievements of this eventful history, without overlooking the tremendous challenges facing the world in the areas of peace, security and sustainable development. It is our hope that the post-2015 development agenda will effectively address all those challenges. Moreover, we should all work within the framework of the United Nations system to alleviate the burden of foreign debt under which many countries suffer, which impedes their economic growth and jeopardizes their stability and social peace.
“We in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania work tirelessly for the welfare for our people through a range of development projects undertaken by the State, in cooperation with the private sector and our development partners. Over the past few years, our country has obtained remarkable results that have had a positive impact on Mauritanians’ standard of living. Unemployment has been curtailed, and we have widened the base for accessing and improving basic services so as to achieve concrete economic growth. In the area of promoting the rule of law, the Government of Mauritania has worked to strengthen the judiciary system and promote its independence so as to ensure that transparency prevails throughout public affairs.
“In recognition of the organic nexus between security and development, my country has made security and development top national priorities and is working to build a modern republican army equipped with every means to ensure the country’s territorial integrity. We have implemented a multitude of projects in the most impoverished regions and provided welfare for vulnerable groups. This policy has had a positive impact on the security of our homeland and its citizens and bolstered the pillars of social peace.
“Our security development approach does not stop there; we have also worked to promote the culture of dialogue and peaceful debate with all those who go astray by misinterpreting and misunderstanding the purposes of our Islamic religion and have fallen
15-29595 21/23

A/70/PV.18 29/09/2015
into extremism and fundamentalism. They have therefore been engaged by our clergy, under the supervision of the Government — an approach that has yielded concrete results. In order to raise awareness of the benefits of that dialogue, we hosted an international seminar under the theme “Culture of peace and moderation” in order to tackle extremism. The Mauritanian experiment is a good example to follow.
“Our region, the African Sahel, has been exposed over the past few years to a proliferation of networks of organized crime. Drugs, weapons and human beings are trafficked and smuggled through waves of illicit migration and hostage-taking; extremist organizations have also adopted terrorism as a profession and thereby endanger security throughout the region.
“In order to address and face these challenges, Mauritania has worked with its brotherly States of Chad, the Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso to establish the group of five Sahel States with a view to designing a development and security framework as a platform for coordinating the resources of member countries in order to promote security and stability and to work to achieve sustainable development, as envisioned in the post-2015 agenda. In this regard, we appreciate the appointment of a Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sahel, entrusted with dealing with regional issues. That augurs well for good cooperation among the group of five Sahel States and the international community in countering terrorism and organized crime and drafting rules for sound and effective sustainable development.
“Recognizing the importance of maintaining international peace and security, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania has taken the initiative to coordinate with the United Nations by participating in its peacekeeping operations. We contributed a unit of national guards that is deployed in the city of Bouaké in the sister State of Côte d’Ivoire. We are also preparing to dispatch an infantry battalion of 450 troops and a national gendarmes unit of 140 officers in order to contribute to establishing peace in the Central African Republic. That is our response to the call of duty towards our brotherly African countries in support of peace and security in our continent.
“The Islamic Republic of Mauritania is following with grave concern the serious developments in sisterly Yemen. In this regard, we support Operation Restoring Hope and the tremendous efforts undertaken by the Arab coalition led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to restore the legitimate system of Government to sisterly Yemen, represented by brother President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour and his Government, and to implement all relevant Security Council resolutions. We hope that the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen to solidify peace and security in this sisterly country will be crowned with success.
“On the other hand, the ongoing war and massive destruction, killing and displacement of millions in Syria require us all to support every effort to bring the Syrian parties together at the negotiating table in order to find a political solution to that war, which has been raging far too long. This solution, we hope, will save Syria from further destruction and maintain its territorial integrity.
“In the same vein, we call on our brothers in Libya to agree to a political solution culminating in the formation of a national Government that would organize fair and transparent elections to put an end to the internecine hostilities that have torn Libya asunder and made it a sanctuary for extremist organizations. We trust that the patriotic spirit of the Libyan people and its leaders will move them in that direction so that a State can be established under the rule of law and the Libyan people can enjoy peace and security.
“The Arab-Israeli conflict remains a source of animosity and a threat to international peace and security in a region that is very sensitive and vital to the entire world. Despite the multitude of United Nations resolutions and negotiations that have dragged on for decades, the two parties have failed to reach a formula for a final resolution that would guarantee the rights of the Palestinian people in an independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We condemn settlement activity and unilateral actions that impede the peace process. We also condemn the unjust siege imposed on the Gaza strip, with all its dire consequences for the brotherly Palestinian people.

“Our continent of Africa faces a multitude of challenges in the economic and security spheres. The many development programmes that have been implemented with our development partners have not achieved the envisaged goals, though some measure of success has been registered. Problems relating to poverty, disease and malnutrition persist and deplete many resources of African countries.
“The outbreak and spread of the Ebola virus disease in some West African countries highlighted the severe shortcomings in the area of fighting epidemics and disease. Despite the fortitude demonstrated by those countries and the generous assistance of African countries and the international community, which stopped the spread of the disease, there is a pressing need to establish a well-developed and integrated health-care system that would protect citizens from diseases and lethal epidemics. There are also many flashpoints of conflict that impede the development of the continent and strain its resources. Despite all these challenges, many African countries succeeded in achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals and are now resolved to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).
“Africa, with its enormous economic resources and its demographic weight, deserves to enjoy a permanent seat on the Security Council. From this rostrum, we demand that this reform be undertaken as expeditiously as possible.
“Perhaps the most viable path to achieving peace and security is to promote the culture of peace and the values of tolerance among nations, peoples and civilizations and to uphold justice for all. Leaving issues unresolved for a long time without any prospect of a solution, as well as the widening gap between the poor and the rich and the imbalance in global economic structures, have contributed to increased tension and the spread of the phenomenon of extremism and terrorism.
“We in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania reject all forms of terrorism, while firmly abiding by tolerant Islamic values that renounce violence, extremism and excess. Islamic values call for tolerance and brotherhood, and it is our belief that it is the duty of the international community to find an effective means to halt the tide of terrorism at its roots and dry up its sources.
“The pledges undertaken by the international community at the birth of the Organization will not be fully met unless and until a minimum level of justice in the production and distribution of wealth is achieved. Furthermore, we will not come full circle in delivering on the noble aspirations for which the United Nations was founded without creating conditions in which human beings can live in dignity, freedom and equality. By those means, we could achieve the noble goals for which the United Nations was established.”
"
70,2015,BFA,"It is my honour to address the Assembly as President of the Transition of Burkina Faso. I wish to convey my warmest and most sincere appreciation to the General Assembly and to congratulate the President on his election to preside over the Assembly at its seventieth session. I should also like to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his clear-sighted guidance of the work of the sixty-ninth session.
Since the transition that I am leading resulted from a popular uprising in October 2014, which said “no” to the arbitrariness, nepotism and injustice of an undemocratic regime, I have come here to promote liberty and democracy. Here, before the Assembly, I have come to extol the virtue of liberty, true liberty, the liberty that the French revolutionaries of 1789 dreamed about and an ideal that so many human beings today still aspire to. I want to call for liberty, plain and simple. As I was deprived of liberty for a time, I know how precious it is. I have come here to pay tribute to democracy, which today has become a universal canon — except in Burkina Faso, where praetorians of another age were trying to row against the tide of history and attempted to seize our democracy in order to serve their sordid ambitions.
Thanks to the international community, which is the defender of those values I just mentioned, I speak here freely before Member States. That was unthinkable only two weeks ago, when I was jailed during the military uprising. On 16 September, my country, Burkina Faso, was the victim of a heinous coup d’état perpetrated by officers bought by vengeful politicians. Moreover, that happened just before the launch of our electoral campaign. The wishes of the people of Burkina Faso were not taken into account. The national and spontaneous response of the people was impressive. They tried to block the path that those adventurers were attempting to take. Regrettably, that led to a tragic loss of life and many wounded. On that occasion, the people of Burkina Faso, and its youth in particular, showed an unprecedented level of patriotism.
15-29816 11/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
The international community also promptly came forward to unanimously condemn the coup and support the transition. From this rostrum, I wish to thank all the countries, without exception, and the international organizations, civil society organizations and journalists from around world that came together so quickly to frustrate the coup d’état, thereby enabling a return to normalcy and legitimacy. The people of Burkina Faso have asked me to speak to the Assembly, to the nations of peace, and to convey our deep appreciation to Member States. We ask them to continue to support our efforts to implant genuine democracy in Burkina Faso through the holding of free and transparent elections, which we will be organizing shortly.
I have spoken at length about my country, but now I wish to address some major concerns on the international scene.
First, the global economic situation continues to develop unfavourably and thus makes demands of us, particularly with regard to our common commitment to eradicate poverty, especially in developing countries. It is completely obvious that we are far from having successfully risen to the challenge of fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals, although several Member States have made significant progress. We must thus redouble our efforts and take robust action in order to improve the living conditions of our populations. “A new commitment to action” — the theme we have chosen for our session calls on us to act quickly to attain tangible results through programmes that are ambitious and, above all, pragmatic.
We should note, in that context, that the Addis Ababa Action Agenda adopted at the third International Conference on Financing for Development lays the groundwork for the effective implementation of the post-2015 development agenda that we have recently adopted (see resolution 70/1). We welcome the holding of that Conference, and we hope that the consensus forged around a new generation of Sustainable Development Goals will bring about social and economic well-being for our populations.
Climate change, a key parameter of development, merits particular attention. That is why the the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December, is so important. The environment pact that should result from that event should enable us to strengthen the protection of our planet against
climate disasters and environmental aggression arising from the abuses of a consumer society.
In 70 years of its existence, the United Nations has unflaggingly endeavoured to work for a world of peace, a world that is safe. Burkina Faso reaffirms its determination to resolutely support peacekeeping efforts around the world. We are already actively participating in peacekeeping operations, in our sister Republic of Mali, for example, where the mission is twofold: to ensure security in the country and to combat terrorism. We contribute to the international community’s efforts to combat terrorism and violent extremism, as the eradication of those phenomena requires a global coalition.
On the issue of disarmament, we must continue our efforts to strengthen confidence among our States. Such confidence facilitated the conclusion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action of 14 July 2015 on the Iran nuclear issue, which reassured the international community with regard to its legitimate fears concerning nuclear proliferation.
We encourage the States Members of the United Nations likewise to move towards a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
With regard to Western Sahara, my country, which has always encouraged a negotiated political solution, reaffirms its endorsement the initiative of the Kingdom of Morocco promoting a status of autonomy for the Sahara region, as a credible and realistic alternative in the conclusion of that dispute.
With regard to the American sanctions imposed on Cuba, Burkina Faso favours its total lifting. We also welcome the recent positive developments between Cuba and the United States of America, which augur well for a definitive normalization of bilateral relations between the two countries.
A full Member of our Organization, Burkina Faso endorses the reforms aimed at streamlining the functioning of the United Nations. On Security Council reform, we reiterate our full support for the African position, which is based on the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.
Always respectful of the ideals of the United Nations, which are based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, dialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes, we welcome and encourage a rapprochement
12/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan.
Before concluding, I wish to convey my appreciation for the international solidarity shown in eradicating the Ebola virus. We must not relax our vigilance. We must intensify international cooperation to maintain those results and ensure that the countries severely affected by that disease can recover. The virtues of international solidarity and dialogue among nations must continue to inspire the United Nations so that together we can meet the challenges of our time.
In the tremendous task before us of building an international society that is more democratic and humane, Burkina Faso can always be found in the front ranks. Burkina Faso wishes to reiterate its good will and deeply thank the Assembly, yet again.
"
70,2015,NPL,"I bring with me the warm greetings of the people and Government of Nepal and their best wishes for the success of the seventieth anniversary of the world body.
I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the seventieth session. With his proven experience and skill, we are confident that he will guide our deliberations to a fruitful conclusion. My delegation wishes to place on record its sincere gratitude to the President of the Assembly at the sixty-ninth session, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa of Uganda, for successfully guiding the business of the preceding session, particularly in the run-up to the United Nations Summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, which adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) last week. Our tribute is also due to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his outstanding service to the Organization in these challenging times.
The theme of the session, “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”, appropriately reflects our innate and collective desire for peace, security and human rights. These are the issues that continue to constitute the focus of our national priorities, regional initiatives and international engagement.
I am pleased to share with the Assembly that, after about eight years of rigorous democratic exercise conducted in an inclusive, transparent and participatory manner, Nepal promulgated an inclusive democratic Constitution 10 days ago, on 20 September. The promulgation of the Constitution endorsed by over 90 per cent of the 601 members of the Constituent Assembly marks the logical conclusion of the peace process, as well as the end of the protracted political transition in the country. It has institutionalized the federal democratic republican system of governance in Nepal.
The Constitution exemplifies the victory of peace and non-violence, as inspired by the teachings of Lord Buddha. It reflects the best of democratic principles, norms and values, as befits a country of vast diversity that has known centuries of social harmony and tolerance. The Constitution opens up new avenues of empowerment, progress and well-being for all disadvantaged groups, including women, Tharus, Madhesis, indigenous people, Muslims and dalits, with a resolve to create an egalitarian society by ending all discrimination. It guarantees 33-per-cent representation by women in the national Parliament. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our neighbours, friends and well-wishers in the international community
for their continued support and good wishes during the course of our historic political transformation.
Nepal is fully committed to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We firmly believe that the United Nations at 70 remains a strong pillar of the international system, as well as the institution of hope and trust. Both the continuing determination of the peoples and the means for attaining the ends envisaged at the time of its inception continue to be an inspiration.
The purposes and principles of the United Nations constitute the solid foundation of international relations. However, a review of the past seven decades of the United Nations also reveals that much more remains to be done on many fronts, despite several far-reaching achievements to its credit. The United Nations continues to confront numerous challenges in the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as in the effective employment of international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples.
We therefore feel that there is a need for a stronger United Nations that is capable of delivering results based on wider respect for and observance of the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and non-interference, as well as of preserving the universal values of peace, justice, equality, freedom and human dignity.
The reforms of the United Nations are needed to strengthen and revitalize its work so that it may better respond to the increasingly complex and profound challenges. The reforms should promote good- neighbourly relations and should contribute to smarter maintenance of international peace and security. The reforms should encourage stricter adherence to the principles and purposes of the Charter. They should serve to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples and to enhance the dignity of the peoples in a just international order. These are the kind of reforms we advocate, support and aspire to. The reforms should encourage those who can do so to contribute more to the cause of peace and progress. The reforms should instil hope and confidence in those who are marginalized and extend support to those who confront difficult circumstances.
Nepal has been consistently contributing to United Nations peacekeeping for about six decades now.
15-29876 5/26

A/70/PV.24 01/10/2015
More than 120,000 of our peacekeepers have served so far with outstanding professionalism in more than 40 different missions around the globe, and 70 have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. As one of the leading troop-contributing countries, Nepal remains steadfast in its commitment to maintaining international peace and security.
Loss of life and injury incurred in the line of duty must be minimized. A strong sense of safety and security enhances the confidence and efficiency of the peacekeepers. Moreover, leadership opportunities should be made available to the member countries commensurate with their contributions. This would make the best use of their experience and would enhance efficiency and inspire commitment. Given its long-standing contribution and experience, both in the field and at Headquarters, Nepal has the ability to make a contribution in senior-level leadership positions in the United Nations peace architecture and is willing to do so.
Nepal fully aligns itself with the United Nations and the international community in dealing with all threats to peace and security. Terrorism is the biggest threat to peace, security and development. It is shocking to see the emergence of various terrorist groups, some of which espouse violent extremism and religious fundamentalism, in different parts of the globe. We unequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. As terrorism is a multifaceted problem, its solution demands greater unity, solidarity and the concerted collaboration of nations to address its root causes. This is best done under the auspices of the United Nations, and we are in favour of concluding a comprehensive convention on international terrorism at an early date.
Nepal stands for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction and against the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons. It wishes to see the world without weapons and would like all resources spent on armaments to be urgently diverted to the cause of development in the interests of meeting the pressing needs of the people.
We consider both the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba and the nuclear deal with Iran to be important indications of forward- looking approaches with positive implications for international peace and security.
We support the call for a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and an end to the conflicts in the region. We recognize the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to an independent State based on United Nations resolutions. We recognize the right of every nation in the region to live in peace within secure and recognized international boundaries.
Since their categorization in 1971, the least developed countries (LDCs) have grown in number from 25 to 48. However, only four countries have so far been able to graduate from this status. The rest continue to struggle for development and prosperity. Their struggle has been unfairly long and has also been at the cost of the dignity of their people. An enhanced level of partnership and collaboration is key to addressing the challenges they face. We welcome the Addis Ababa Action Agenda adopted in July. Its implementation will be critical for the success of the new Agenda. We look forward to a meaningful review of the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action in 2016.
Similarly, there is a strong need for effective implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action to make a difference in the lives of about 450 million people living in landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). The world needs to ensure unhindered access to the sea by the LLDCs, without restriction on the free movement of people and goods. We stress that the freedom of transit of LLDCs should not be constrained under any circumstances or on any pretext, and that nothing should disrupt the flow of goods and services. The freedom of transit of LLDCs must be fully and unconditionally adhered to by all transit countries.
As a country with many of the highest peaks in the world, as well as fragile mountain ecosystems, Nepal is aware of the hardships faced by the mountainous countries. An enhanced level of international collaboration is essential to conserve and promote the mountain ecosystems for the benefit of all.
Climate change has emerged as one of the greatest development challenges confronting us. For the least developed countries, like Nepal, it increases the cost of development and also causes disproportionate impacts on them. There is an urgent need to translate commitments into concrete actions based on the accepted principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective capabilities. The achievement of a binding international instrument in Paris later this year is a must.

Human rights, equality and human dignity constitute an integral part of the United Nations objectives. We believe in an integrated approach to democracy, development and human rights, and we firmly hold the view that democracy is indispensable for development, as well as for the enjoyment of political, cultural and social rights and the right to development. We underline that the principles of universality, objectivity and non-selectivity must be strictly adhered to. The new Constitution promulgated in our country guarantees the fundamental rights of our citizens. Its ambitious scope has broadened the rights of women, children, the elderly and differently abled persons and of marginalized communities.
The issue of refugees is intricately linked with peace, security and human rights and therefore must be addressed with the seriousness and priority it deserves. Migration has emerged as a megatrend. Migrant workers today represent a significant proportion of the mobile population. In view of the greater vulnerabilities of such people, due recognition and priority should be given to the protection of their rights and dignity.
We in Nepal were overwhelmed by the unprecedented scale of the expression of solidarity and cooperation from the international community in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes that struck Nepal in April and May. I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to our neighbours, India and China, fellow members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, and all those friends and well-wishers who so promptly extended their humanitarian support and expressed solidarity with us in difficult moments and made us feel that we were not alone. We consider the global outpouring of support and solidarity to be astonishing but significant evidence of the vast scope and potential of the spirit of the United Nations. Nepal looks to continued support and solidarity in the phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.
The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on the historic occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations has generated optimism for a better future across the world. To be truly transformative, the Sustainable Development Goals must embrace everyone and must be implemented in their entirety with the required resources. To this end, guaranteed means of implementation, encompassing finance, technology transfer, capacity and partnership, are critical. Many of the development issues that many
countries face, particularly the most vulnerable ones, deserve more serious attention if we are to strengthen the cause of peace and security.
We want the United Nations and the international community to turn their immediate attention to the issues of growing inequality and dwindling resources and to the existential threat of global warming. Poverty remains a powerful threat to peace, security and human rights. It is a minefield, compounding the woes and sufferings of society. Let us not forget that it is the poor who are constantly exposed to violence, corruption, extortion and the malpractices of the powerful.
I would like to conclude with what Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, the first elected Prime Minister of Nepal, told the General Assembly at the fifteenth session,
“As we look at the world, we find that the economic disparity between countries, as between the rich and the poor people within the nation, is the source of much friction and tension” (A/PV.878, para. 232).
Economic disparity continues to stare at us all, as it did then. Let us commit ourselves to creating a sustainable, equitable and inclusive development in larger freedom to address this problem.
I am confident that the spirit of the United Nations will continue to prevail for the benefit of humankind in the days to come.
"
70,2015,WSM,"Last Friday ushered in a new era in our search for an innovative plan of action for people and the planet. The significant milestone event was the adoption by the United Nations of the new set of Sustainable Development Goals as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).
Our 17 Sustainable Development Goals are inspirational and ambitious. They are global in nature and universally applicable to every United Nations Member State, developed and developing alike. Every Goal is important and deserves priority attention. They are interrelated, they carry equal weight and they all matter. Achieving some Goals at the expense of others is not a preferred option. All Goals must be realized, which should be the overriding objective.
In my firm belief in the importance of the work of our Organization, I have tried to attend the annual General Assembly debates as often as possible since becoming Samoa’s Prime Minister. I am therefore acutely aware of the diversity and gravity of issues confronting our Organization and the need sometimes to refer to them in one’s statement. However, partly in recognition of the new Agenda we have now agreed to implement and as a gesture to the seventieth anniversary of our Organization and the imminent danger of climate change for small island developing States (SIDS), my statement in essence is devoted to Sustainable Development Goal 13, “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”. That is also a priority goal enshrined in the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway, the outcome document of the third International Conference on SIDS.
Climate change will continue to be the major preoccupation and priority policy determinant for Samoa well into the future. I think that the same would be true for all our Pacific island countries and the wider SIDS. Thus, to contextualize our perspective on climate change, allow me to share with representatives a part of our narrative.
First, here are some givens. Climate change is the single most urgent challenge confronting humankind; it is facilitated largely by human-induced activities driven for the most part by profit motives, with some degree of insensitivity to the consequences of such action on others, particularly those vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, who are usually ill-prepared to adapt and in most cases had barely contributed to the causes of climate change in the first place.
Climate change is not a future phenomenon. It is real, irreversible and is already happening with far more frequency. It is no longer a question of when; rather, it is about the severity of the magnitude of the impacts and the full cost society must bear. Even now in my country, we are suffering drought conditions. These will give way to the onset of the cyclone season, which is predicted to have a high likelihood of severe cyclones in our Pacific region.
As this is a cross-cutting issue, ambitious actions or solutions at the national and international levels to try to address the root causes of climate change will inevitably end up either being compromised, watered down or put aside due to political, social and economic considerations taking precedence over basic climate logic. Climate change is not a concern of small island developing States alone; it impacts every country, but some — such as small island developing States — more extensively like than others because our capacity to respond quickly and effectively is constrained by our realities.
In summary, climate change cannot be wished away. It is real, irreversible and already happening. It has significant security implications and its impact threatens the continued existence and viability of some small island developing States. Even those countries that to date have been in denial of the climate change phenomenon must surely now accept the weight of scientific evidence.
Samoa is a small island developing State of the Pacific, a region recognized and acknowledged as most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Our islands contributed the least to the causes of climate change, yet stand to suffer the most and are least able to adapt effectively to the adverse impacts.
Climate change is a security risk of far greater proportions than many people are prepared to admit. For some of the low-lying Pacific islands, climate change may well lead to their eventual extinction as sovereign States. Just a few months ago, I was privileged to attend the special Security Council open debate on the security concerns of SIDS (see S/PV.7499). It was an important opportunity to highlight in the Council the security threat posed by climate change to all our small island developing States.
Against the backdrop of the existential threat climate change poses, especially to atolls and low- lying islands, SIDS have long advocated for ambitious mitigation efforts to be undertaken by Member States with the capacity to do so, and for a global goal of limiting the rise in average global temperature to well below 1.5°C in order to prevent some of our low-lying islands from being submerged by sea-level rise. We have also consistently called for a loss and damage mechanism to be anchored in a new Paris agreement to be treated separately from adaptation. With the gradual operationalization of the Green Climate Fund, we have asked SIDS representatives on the Green Climate Fund Board to ensure that the spirit and letter of the governing instrument of the Fund, as they relate to those areas that will be beneficial to SIDS, are retained and not compromised.
Our pleas over the years on the 1.5°C and the loss and damage caused by climate change have largely gone unnoticed. At least the countries our messages had been intended for have remained unconvinced, but I hope not uninterested. Part of this, I think, is due to some misguided notion that climate phenomena and related events affect small island developing States only. Some might have concluded already that climate change is not life-threatening and does not affect them, either because their countries are huge in size or have well-developed infrastructure to shield them from any real damage from climate change impacts.
It may also be that there is an implied sense that if the large problems of the bigger, stronger, more populous and well-developed countries are solved, then the solutions to the afflictions of SIDS will automatically follow. As a result, challenges facing SIDS are conveniently viewed by others through the same lens that blurs the distinctions and fails to bring out the truth about the urgency and dire consequences of the problems we face because of climate change.

But times are changing and the world has witnessed in recent months and years an epic outbreak of horrific natural disasters unprecedented in the 70-year history of our Organization. Tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding, bush fires and droughts have resulted in the loss of countless lives and untold sorrow and suffering. Especially noteworthy is the fact that developed countries are no longer insulated from the reach and destructive force of these events. Some countries and regions have been visited by climate-related and natural events like cyclones, bush fires, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, tornados, and so on.
What is happening across our planet is quite significant because it discredits the perception long held by some that climate change is a small island developing States concern only. Nothing could be further from the truth. Events of the recent past have demonstrated that climate-related disasters do not discriminate between poor and rich countries, big or small. Climate change affects us all, developed and developing countries alike, although in varying degrees. I submit therefore that this realization should shape our overall approach going forward to the Paris Climate Change Conference in December and beyond. It should, I hope, also help to shift the focus in the relationship, in the specific context of climate change, from that of donor/recipient or donor/victim to one of partner/partner in a joint partnership.
While that may sound overly simplified, its real value lies in the change of perspective which this reorientation should bring and in how we view our respective roles when trying to address climate change. This, I think, should be beneficial to all. Because we are now all affected by climate change in one way or another, that should energize everyone to do their utmost, either as current or future victims of climate change impacts, so as to ensure that we address the root causes urgently and in a decisive manner.
After all, human nature tells us that when we are asked to do something for a friend or someone else, the impact is not the same because there is no sense of obligation, commitment or urgency. But when we have to do something because it will affect us personally, our children or family, nothing will prevent us from doing all that is possible within our power, especially if it affects our own safety and future. I hope that Member States, imbued not just with the projections of science but now with the advanced evidence of actual events,
will be prepared to go the extra mile to do the maximum possible for their own future survival.
Climate change is a societal problem requiring a decisive response from the global community. It is a challenge that should unite us, not divide us. No country can deal with this problem alone. We must work cooperatively in a partnership of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capability if we are to succeed. But true partnerships should be underpinned by trust. Without trust, they cannot be sustained. Apportioning blame for past wrongs would be counterproductive; it would not restore our environment to its pre-industrial state.
Clearly we want leaders who view the world as a single constituency where everyone must work together within the limits of their capacity and capability to be part of the total solution. Sadly, some in our global community have been dismissive and remain unconvinced. Others, through their actions, have been indifferent and unsympathetic. But there is hope, and our whole focus is on Paris. What is needed is principled action. The Paris agreement will require a new brand of cooperation and a broader outlook. The narrow pursuit of self-interests, the use of economic and political expediencies should be set aside and must not be allowed to derail the goal of concluding a universal, ambitious and legally binding agreement.
Climate change is also everyone’s job. While acknowledging that historical responsibility is real, allowing it to get in the way of making decisions to reach a comprehensive agreement would be a grave mistake. A durable climate change agreement in Paris will therefore be a test of multilateral solidarity. Time is running out. The impacts of climate change are getting worse daily. Playing the blame-and-shame tactics or waiting to be led but not willing to lead are no longer options, for no single nation, no single group of nations and no single organization on its own can win the war against climate change. The divergent, yet inextricably linked interests of Member States demand that we seal a good deal in Paris.
The Paris agreement should focus on bold national action and the inclusion of all stakeholders; it should be a timely reminder that no action is too small or insignificant. All contributions matter and every action counts, irrespective of the source. Importantly, it must place the responsibility of addressing climate change squarely on every individual leader in terms of
15-29701 3/28

A/70/PV.21 30/09/2015
what national actions he or she can commit to deliver as his or her country’s contribution to our collective task. Samoa is putting the final touches to its intended nationally determined contributions, which are quite ambitious and will be submitted in due course to the secretariat in Bonn.
Often at times we blame others for our misfortunes and the current status of our development, including by telling others what they should do, by when and how, but rarely saying what we can contribute to make a change. So when my country and our people are continuously exposed to the impacts of climate change, we want to be part of the solution by committing to doing everything possible for the benefit of our people, our generation and those to follow. That must be our universal message, simple and unambiguous.
As for those suggesting that they are implementing bold actions for the sake of our vulnerable small island developing States, they should instead be reminded to take time to inform their constituencies and supporters alike, especially those who deny climate change, that in the final analysis the actions being recommended, if implemented, will ultimately benefit their economies, their own people and the survival of their own countries.
The United Nations remains our last best hope to provide the political will and the commitment necessary to turn the tide against climate change. Samoa calls upon those States Members of our Organization in a position of world leadership to lead the charge in finding and implementing solutions to the causes of climate change. As present custodians of our world’s environment, we owe it to our children and future generations to do what needs to be done quickly and decisively before we run out of time. It is therefore imperative to complete the Paris climate agreement in time for the twenty-first session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in December to adopt an agreement that is ambitious, universally applicable, effective, binding, capable of swift implementation and universally owned and respected by all Member States.
In the same way that nations in leadership roles are called on to do the right thing for our world, so must all Member States of the United Nations uphold their part of the bargain in the work that needs to be done. Without that cooperation on the part of all Member States, reaching the objectives we all know should be achieved will continue to elude us.
International terrorism is a global menace. It creates an atmosphere of collective fear and intolerance. It preys on the innocent, vulnerable and defenceless, and disrupts any progress towards peace and development. Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations should always be condemned unreservedly. Over the past several weeks, we have witnessed the tragedy of people fleeing their countries mired in the destruction from war and terrorism. Obviously, a credible and long- term response is needed to this grave crisis, which has cost so many lives and affected so many people. The individual actions of States cannot in themselves provide a solution. We must shoulder our responsibility to act together to meet the threat through the concerted multilateral action that underpins the spirit of the Organization. Ideally, it must start in the Security Council, which is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining world peace.
The coherence of the response of the United Nations depends on the work and cooperative spirit of the Security Council to see the larger picture of the future of our world. The reforms to our Organization must therefore be given priority and take account of the concerns of our full membership. Our world has enjoyed peace and security for 70 years by faithfully observing and following the Charter of our Organization. As world leaders, it is our moral duty and responsibility to ensure that our people continue to live in peace and harmony for many more years to come.
"
70,2015,SMR,"I would like to congratulate the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I also wish to commend the work of His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the General Assembly at the sixty-ninth session, and to express sincere thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in leading the United Nations. The result of such efforts culminated in the very successful United Nations Summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda and this general debate, as well as the historic
visit of the Holy Father, Pope Francis, to the General Assembly (see A/70/PV.3). Moreover, San Marino appreciates the constant and impartial attention that the Secretary-General has paid to all States Members of the United Nations.
After 70 years, the United Nations has not only passed the test of time, but it continues to represent a shining beacon of hope for all our countries. I believe that in future we will have to be even more willing and inspired to strengthen and improve the role that this great institution plays. In fact, the first and last line of defence for San Marino, a small State without an army and with limited territory and resources, is the United Nations.
Even the strongest and largest countries cannot deal with the complexity and the multitude of today problems all by themselves. They need the United Nations too. With the help of the United Nations system, we, the Member States, have over the years built the foundations for peace by preventing and ending numerous disputes. We have been able to free millions of people from extreme poverty and have made important progress in advancing human rights and democracy and in promoting justice and international law.
Unfortunately, despite all our efforts and successes, the international community continues to face the same challenges: wars, poverty, inequality, discrimination and violence against women and children. In addition, today we face new global challenges, such as climate change, economic and financial crises, unrelenting unemployment, international migration and terrorism. Those new threats are interdependent, and we should work together with the United Nations to take them on and defeat them.
Around the world, our people look to the United Nations for leadership. That is why reform of the United Nations is fundamental and must remain at the core of our collective efforts during the seventieth session of the General Assembly. We must make the Organization more effective, while preserving its integrity and enhancing its status.
Every day, we witness the tragic migration from Africa and Asia towards Europe. Those desperate people have left their countries and their families behind, fleeing from conflicts, violence and persecution. Thousands of them have died in the Mediterranean Sea. We are pleased that, a few days ago, the high-
20/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
level side event here at Headquarters on strengthening cooperation on migration and refugee movements in the perspective of the new development agenda was organized.
San Marino cannot remain silent about what is happening in Iraq and Syria, where an ongoing inhuman ethnic and religious cleansing is being carried out with unprecedented ferocity. We hope that under the able stewardship of Mr. Staffan de Mistura, a diplomatic solution will be found in the near future.
San Marino believes that one of the most important tasks for us to deal with is the total elimination of nuclear weapons, thousands of which are ready to be employed at any time. We cannot afford to wait any longer.
San Marino strongly believes in further revitalizing and empowering the General Assembly, the forum where solutions to today’s challenges can be found and where consensus on issues of common interest must be reached. We commend the Security Council for all the delicate and challenging work that it has accomplished over the years in favour of peace and security. Nevertheless, it is time for a reform. We believe that Security Council reform should include an enlargement of the category of non-permanent members and a more balanced geographical distribution. We are convinced that, for that reform to be legitimate, it must be achieved with the widest possible consensus.
We welcome the new post-2015 development agenda adopted a few days ago as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). It represents a unique opportunity to prepare a brighter future for our citizens. The Goals at the core of the new Agenda are ambitious; they will guide our efforts in pursuit of poverty eradication, the empowerment of people, the safeguarding of human dignity, shared prosperity, decent jobs for all, and the protection of our planet. It is important that each country, after adopting its national agenda, assume responsibility for its own citizens and for the international community in working to implement the new Agenda. San Marino welcomes the fact that the high-level political forum on sustainable development and the Economic and Social Council will be assessing the progress of that implementation. However, it is critical that a comprehensive and effective mechanism for review and accountability be established.
The Republic of San Marino has always paid special attention to the most vulnerable groups, such as
women, children, the elderly and the disabled. Today, women are still the victims of discrimination and violence in many parts of the world, including in the most developed countries. Trafficking in women is an issue that is far from having been solved. Women living in conflict and post-conflict situations are often subject to sexual violence, torture and summary execution. Children, the most vulnerable group, are also subject to violence, abuse and exploitation. A large number of children all over the world do not yet have access to basic services, health care and education. We have the duty to protect and help our children. Moreover, the international community must strive for the full inclusion and participation of the elderly and people with disabilities in the economic, social and cultural life of our communities.
Freedom and peace have always represented the core values of the Republic of San Marino over its centuries-old history. San Marino is a small country, but one strongly committed to the implementation of the universal values of the United Nations and the principles enshrined in its Charter. We are honoured to offer our contribution to the United Nations community.
"
70,2015,EST,"When I addressed the Assembly last year (see A/69/PV.8), foremost on our minds was the state of European and global security. The blatant violation of international law in connection with the occupation of Ukrainian territory that we witnessed in the spring of 2014 triggered a profound change in the global security situation. A year later, we are still adapting to that altered, more unpredictable state of affairs. As we continue to tackle global challenges, including terrorism, climate change, poverty and human rights violations, the number of conflicts and crises worldwide continues to grow.
We also witnessed a positive development recently. Let us hope that the historic agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme will pave the way for greater stability in the broader Middle East. It is a region where conflicts in Syria and Libya have led to the radicalization of an ever greater number of people and to the emergence of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). It poses a serious threat to peace and security in Syria, Iraq and the broader Middle East. ISIL violates universal human values. No country is immune to the threat that it poses. Stopping ISIL and other terrorist organizations requires a global effort. Estonia supports the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, and we believe that the United Nations and the Global Counterterrorism Forum also have an important role to play there.
The ongoing crises and conflicts, including in Syria and Libya, have also led to the current refugee crisis in Europe. While Europe’s refugee crisis has been in the international headlines in recent months, the problem itself is obviously wider and more global. According to United Nations statistics, one in every 122 persons is now either a refugee, an asylum seeker abroad or an
internally displaced person in his or her home country. Worldwide, 42,000 people flee their homes every day. Never before have there been so many people forced to be on the move. The civil war in Syria alone has created more than 4 million refugees. The majority of them have sought refuge in neighbouring countries, which have borne by far the greatest burden. But many refugees have opted to take the dangerous route across the Mediterranean and have ended up in Europe. There were 600,000 asylum seekers in Europe in 2014, and there will be far more this year.
I am also extremely worried about the rising support that we are witnessing for far-right and far-left political movements in Europe, often fuelled by anti-immigrant, racist statements that threaten the liberal-democratic base of our continent that has allowed us to live in prosperity since the Second World War. Short-sighted populist policies exploiting the fears of ordinary people will lead nowhere.
The European Union (EU) is the main donor in the effort to alleviate the Syrian refugee crisis. Approximately €4 billion has been mobilized by the European Commission and EU member States for humanitarian, development, economic and stabilization assistance to Syrian internally displaced persons and refugees. And more efforts are being planned, including an African trust fund. The aim is to shift the focus from dealing with the consequences of the migration crisis to dealing with its root causes. But this truly biblical movement of people demands a global response.
We not only have the responsibility to bring peace and stability to Syria and Libya but also to put an end to the aggression against Ukraine. Compared to what it was a year ago, the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine is less intense, but daily fighting continues. Crimea remains illegally occupied. Those responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 are still at large. The attempts to obstruct justice on that matter are deeply disturbing. The long-standing protracted conflicts in Georgia, Moldova and Nagorno Karabakh remain unresolved. Dialogue and diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict must continue. A solution to the conflict must, however, not come at the expense of the principles that underpin European and global security. We must continue to stand up for the international agreements that we have collectively agreed upon — the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris for a New Europe — and demand that they be honoured
15-29437 15/26

A/70/PV.17 29/09/2015
and enforced. We must continue to stand up to attempts to divide countries and establish spheres of influence.
As the number of conflicts and crises worldwide grows, respect for human rights has become more important than ever. We must uphold universal values and stop massive violations of human rights and crimes against humanity, regardless of who or what caused them. As stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights apply to everyone without exception.
This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform of Action, which have influenced how we address equality and women’s rights today. We need to continuously stand for the rights of women and girls and strive for the elimination of gender-based violence. Women’s rights and the empowerment of women and girls must be promoted at all levels. I welcome the 2015 high-level review and global study on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and hope that it will provide us with a new impetus to move forward on those issues. We must advance global actions linked to the welfare of children by investing in their education and health, as well as by keeping them away from armed conflicts.
An active and dynamic civil society is a precondition for prosperity. A free press, the freedom of speech and the freedom of conscience are the cornerstones of any open society. In an era of so-called multiple narratives, we must pay tribute to those activists, journalists and bloggers who risk their lives to expose the truth.
This year, the Human Rights Council established a mandate on the right to privacy. Journalists, bloggers, human rights activists and many others living under authoritarian regimes have urged their Governments to stop the arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy. They have called on their Governments to stop taking over their emails, closing their blogs and applying censorship. Unfortunately, the situation concerning the right to privacy and the freedom of expression has worsened during the past several years. Governments must protect the right to privacy, as stated in articles 2, 17 and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Any interference with privacy must be lawful and reasonable. At the same time, the right to the freedom of expression must be guaranteed. Estonia has high expectations with regard to the new mandate.
This is a crucial year for global action against poverty and for promoting sustainable development.
I welcome the historic agreement reached on the Sustainable Development Goals in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Action (resolution 70/1). National Governments can play a key role in creating an environment conducive to sustainable development. The promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies, the respect for human rights, gender equality, the rule of law and good governance, as well as environmental sustainability, are central to the new global partnership. Economic growth is, assuredly, important, but must not come at the expense of the environment. The twenty- first session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held soon in Paris, should reach an agreement that promotes those goals.
The smart use of the Internet and digital technologies can be essential drivers for economic growth and development. We need strong public policies so that the digital era can become a genuine success and a motor of development for each country and each member of society. That requires a stable, predictable legal environment that encourages foreign investment and competition. We also need an educational system that teaches the necessary new skills, and we need an accessible Internet and Internet freedom. Those are steps that only Governments can provide.
Ninety per cent of the people without access to the Internet live in the developing world. Bridging the digital divide among and within countries — across borders, gender, income and age — is essential for a contemporary digital economy. In 2016, the Internet itself will become the world’s fifth-largest economy, behind only those of the United States, China, Japan and India. It is time for world leaders to place the potential of digital technologies at the top of the development agenda. I am personally glad to co-chair the advisory panel for the upcoming World Bank World Development Report 2016. That report, entitled “Digital Dividends”, examines how the Internet can be a force for development and asks, importantly, what is required to unlock the still largely unrealized potential of digital technologies.
Adherence to the principle of the rule of law is an essential cornerstone of peace and security. Estonia strongly supports the International Criminal Court (ICC) in its activities, including its quest to end impunity. We call on all countries that have not yet done so to join the Rome Statute of the ICC. We also urge all States parties to join in the ratification of the outcome documents of
16/26 15-29437

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17
the Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the ICC. The responsibility to provide accountability is, first and foremost, a domestic task. It is therefore essential that States build their national capacities to investigate and prosecute serious international crimes. Estonia has provided development cooperation resources to assist countries in their national implementation of the Rome Statute, and we encourage other States parties to act in a similar manner.
Under the first pillar of the responsibility to protect, all States Members of the United Nations commit to protect their people from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the responsibility to protect, I reiterate our support for that principle, and call on the international community to make a renewed commitment to prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The Security Council bears primary responsibility in that regard. Unfortunately, in the most serious situations, the Security Council has failed to act owing to the abuse of the veto. It is disappointing that in cases such as those of Syria and Ukraine, Council debates have brought no result. Council members must not vote against actions aimed at preventing and stopping mass atrocities. We therefore support the initiatives of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) group and of France and Mexico on the non-use of the veto in cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or other atrocities.
Security Council reform clearly needs to become a reality. United Nations reform, which Estonia strongly supports, is not only about the Security Council. We see this seventieth anniversary of the United Nations as a good opportunity to make progress on reform. As a member of the ACT group, Estonia is eager to increase transparency in the process of the election of the next Secretary-General. I am glad that some ACT proposals have already contributed to making the process more transparent. For the first time in the history of the United Nations, an agreement has emerged to the effect that the election process, the lists of candidates and informal meetings should begin in a concrete way. I hope for close cooperation between the Presidents of the General Assembly and the Security Council to that end.
Let me stress the importance of taking responsibility. We are being assaulted by an avalanche of problems. It is especially important that we adhere to our values and
stand by our commitments. Only then will the concepts of human rights, equality, democracy and international law acquire meaning. Only if we uphold those values will we be able to surmount the turbulent times in which we find ourselves today.
"
70,2015,TZA,"I join those who have spoken before me in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your well- deserved election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventieth session. Your election is a fitting tribute to your distinguished political career, having served as Foreign Minister and Finance Minister of your country, and recently as Speaker of the Danish Parliament. It is also a reflection of the high regard that the Assembly has for your great country, Denmark. I would like to assure you of my country’s full support and cooperation in discharging your duties and responsibilities.
I also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uganda, for the outstanding manner in which he steered the affairs of the Assembly at its sixty- ninth session. Indeed, that great son of the African soil has done us proud.
I also wish to express a well-deserved word of appreciation for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his staff for their dedicated service and efforts in promoting the ideals and principles of the United Nations. I also commend you, Mr. President, and the President of the General Assembly at its sixty- ninth session, as well as the Secretary-General, for the excellent work culminating in the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda (resolution 70/1) and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with their 169 targets. We sincerely hope that reliable mechanisms will ensure the availability of the means of implementation and follow-up. It was the failure to have
15-29437 3/26

A/70/PV.17 29/09/2015
such mechanisms that was responsible for the shortfalls in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.
My delegation welcomes the theme of this session, “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”. The United Nations at 70 not only has withstood the test of time, but has evolved and become a strong Organization. I am glad we all agree that much has been achieved in the past seven decades. Equally, we agree that not everything that the founding fathers envisaged the United Nations could do has been done satisfactorily. The United Nations has succeeded in preventing another world war, but the challenges of preserving world peace and security remain. Inter- and intra-State conflicts and wars are many and on the increase. Terrorism has become a serious global threat. There are still too many people who live in conditions of abject poverty, squalor and deprivation in a world of unprecedented wealth.
Unlike 70 years ago, today there is better understanding, cooperation and partnership among countries and organizations in preserving peace and security. It is easier today for the world to come together to promote peace than it was before. As a matter of fact, most of the conflicts we are witnessing today are being handled, first and foremost, by regional and subregional organizations. The United Nations therefore must seek to forge strategic partnerships with such organizations. By taking advantage of the knowledge they have of the history and nature of the crises, key players and cultures of the people involved, it would be more successful in managing and resolving conflicts. Where and when appropriate, the United Nations should invest in strengthening the capacity of those organizations and their member States in anticipating, detecting, preventing, managing and resolving conflicts. I am of the view that such capacity is urgently needed in Africa.
We highly commend the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and the Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations on reform of the Security Council for their efforts. It is the wish of the majority of Member States to see an acceleration of the negotiation process during the current session. For the Security Council to remain what it was 70 years ago is incomprehensible and, to say the least, unacceptable. It is high time that the demands of the majority of the Member States be heard and heeded. We must be mindful of the fact that the credibility of the United Nations depends upon a more agile, representative
and responsive Security Council. Let us all muster the courage and political will to accomplish that long-overdue task for the sake of the Organization. In the meantime, we must continue to support the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly.
Peacekeeping operations remain one of the most dependable instruments for promoting world peace and security. I believe that they will remain so for many years to come. I am told that there are approximately 125,000 men and women deployed in 16 peacekeeping missions across the world. Tanzania is proud to have contributed 1,322 of those gallant people, who often serve under challenging conditions. Sometimes they are compelled to serve in places where there is little or no peace to keep. Tanzania stands ready to contribute more, whenever and wherever requested to do so.
We cannot talk about the security challenges of today without mentioning terrorism — a security challenge about which the United Nations and the entire international community must remain vigilant in the coming decade. While reiterating our strongest condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, we believe that there is an urgent need to bolster efforts at all levels for fighting that scourge. Collectively, we must aspire to improve our preparedness, collaboration and response to the threat we face.
The Ebola outbreak in West Africa in the past year is a stark reminder of how dangerous epidemics can be and how vulnerable we are as nations and peoples. More than 11,000 people lost their lives, including citizens of the United States and Spain, and approximately 28,000 were infected. The economies of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone were devastated. Economic activities and services almost ground to a halt, thereby causing enormous losses to the economies of the three countries. The World Bank estimates that they lost about $2.2 billion in gross domestic product as a result. Approximately 7,000 children lost their parents, and half a million people became food-insecure. More than 5 million children lost valuable schooling and skills- development time. Mammoth recovery efforts are required to get those economies and societies back to where they were before the outbreak. Unfortunately, many countries in Africa also suffered, irrespective of how distant those countries were from the three primarily affected countries. The tourism industry is a case in point: it is suffering throughout Africa.
4/26 15-29437

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17
The biggest lesson from the handling of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is that the world needs to be better prepared to prevent and respond to epidemics in future. That was not the case for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. In that regard, we should all commend the Secretary-General for his wise decision to establish the High-level Panel on the Global Response to Health Crises to make recommendations on how the world can better respond to public-health emergencies of global concern in the future. I was given the honour of chairing the Panel. It is premature for me to report anything substantive now to the General Assembly. We will complete our work in December, and I am sure our report will be brought before the Assembly for information and action. We look forward to the Assembly’s support.
Tanzania welcomes the historic and momentous decision taken by the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba to restore diplomatic relations and reopen embassies in Washington, D.C., and Havana. We join the people of Cuba and the people of the United States in celebrating that landmark achievement. We commend President Barack Obama and President Raúl Castro Ruz for their bold and courageous leadership. The two leaders and countries have proved to all of us the power of dialogue in finding solutions even when the differences are deep-rooted and the conflicts long- standing. We extend best wishes to our United States and Cuban friends as they open a new chapter in their bilateral relations. We hope that the United States will lift the remaining economic sanctions and appeal to it to do so. The sanctions have condemned the people of Cuba to untold socioeconomic hardships, poverty and misery for the past 50 years.
In the same vein, it is our wish that Israel and Palestine would resume dialogue so that their long- standing conflict can be resolved peacefully. It is high time that the pain and suffering endured by the people of Palestine over many decades be brought to an end. It is about time that the people of Israel lived peacefully and harmoniously with their neighbours. It is regrettable that, as we celebrate 70 years since the founding of the United Nations, the conflict remains unresolved. Tanzania subscribes to and supports the two-State solution, with the State of Israel and a sovereign, contiguous and viable State of Palestine living side by side in peace, security, harmony, mutual recognition, trust and cooperation. We believe it is possible and achievable. All that is required of us is to redouble our efforts.
Another outstanding issue for the Organization is that of Western Sahara, a matter that must not be left unresolved. The lack of action on the part of the United Nations to implement its decisions in the matter is both regrettable and incomprehensible. The people of Saharawi have waited far too long for an opportunity to determine their fate and future. Let this Organization muster the political will and pluck up the courage to do what it decided long ago to do. At 70, the United Nations is old enough and has accumulated enough wisdom and experience to put this matter to rest. Please, let us do it.
On 20 September 2006 I stood at this rostrum (see A/61/PV.13) for the first time and addressed the General Assembly as the newly elected fourth President of my dear country, the United Republic of Tanzania. Today I stand here to bid farewell, as I prepare to leave office upon the completion of my two-term mandate, in accordance with the Tanzanian Constitution. I thank all my colleagues in the Assembly for the invaluable support and cooperation they have extended to me, my Administration and my country over the past 10 years of our work together. Kindly be assured that I will always value each and every contribution. I feel proud to have had the opportunity to work with all Member States to promote the ideals of the United Nations and to contribute to the pursuit of world peace, security, stability and development.
As I take my leave, I would like to assure the Assembly that Tanzania will remain a faithful Member and an unwavering supporter of the United Nations. I am confident that Members will find in my successor a likeable and dependable friend and ally. Please accord him or her — I should add that we have a female candidate for the presidency of Tanzania — the necessary support and cooperation in fulfilling his or her duties and responsibilities.
The road ahead for peace, security and development remains challenging but worth the journey. It requires our renewed resolve and the reaffirmation of our commitment to the ideals, values and principles set down by the founding fathers of the United Nations seven decades ago in San Francisco. All nations, individually and collectively, should endeavour to promote them, as we have been doing for the past 70 years. It can be done. The international community must play its part.
"
70,2015,CHE,"On the ruins of a world ravaged by the Second World War, 51 countries decided to give humankind a forum for voicing opinions again and came together to proclaim the values enshrined in the Charter: dignity, human rights, equality, justice, tolerance and peace.
It is fitting that we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of our Organization, which has achieved so much. It would be difficult to imagine a world without the United Nations. It has contributed to reducing poverty in a great many countries, and it has achieved its primary goal: our generation is the first one not to have lived through a world war. However, if we wish to make an honest assessment we also need to be critical.
Today, close to 120,000 soldiers are currently active in United Nations peacekeeping missions. That means that the crises and the wars which ravage the world are still far too many in number. Today we have 60 million displaced persons worldwide, which is more than at any time since the United Nations was founded. Not only have we not made sufficient progress when tackling certain problems, but we have created new ones ourselves, such as global warming.
Even though we might not like to admit this, we must recognize that our behaviour continues to be marked by major inconsistencies. I should like to offer two examples of that. First, many countries continue to live in abject poverty when they have a wealth of natural resources. Secondly, we are concerned about movements of mass migration, yet, by causing global
warming, we are depriving entire populations of the basic conditions they need in order to remain where they are.
Let us ask ourselves why so many educated young people wish to leave their own countries. This concerns not only developing countries but also a considerable number of European States as well. We must acknowledge that we have not yet succeeded in achieving anything close to a fair global distribution of wealth, nor have we succeeded in establishing the rule of law as the norm. Corruption remains endemic.
We have to admit that we have not yet succeeded in combining growth with the protection of our environment. Furthermore, all too often national interests impede the formulation of joint responses. I am thinking here specifically of the refugee crisis in the Middle East and in Europe. Faced with such major flows of migrants, the solutions can only be joint ones. If we each continue to look after our own interests, we will all lose out in the end — the migrants will lose out, and the solidarity between States will fall by the wayside. If we fail to protect human dignity, we do ourselves a disservice, because to betray one’s own values is to betray oneself. I say once again, therefore, that the refugee crises require responses based on solidarity.
One cannot ask Turkey, Jordan or Lebanon to take in all the refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria. These countries have already done so much, such admirable work, which has received too little recognition thus far. Similarly, it is not possible to ask a few European countries to take in all of the refugees. We will all be judged on how we respond to this traumatic humanitarian challenge.
Here we face yet another inconsistency. If countries seek answers to such large-scale phenomena as the current migration movements in an individualistic way, without coordinating, everything will be brought to a standstill. Human beings are not free from inconsistencies, none of us are. To some extent at least, that is part of human nature. However, when it comes to the actions of Governments, States and communities of States, we must strive to minimize such inconsistencies. As we all know, in order to address poverty, the challenges of migration, conflicts, terrorism, organized crime and climate change, collective action is vital.
The United Nations is more necessary than ever. What we require is a strong United Nations for a better world. To that end, we need to focus on three priorities.
The ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) that we have just adopted is a huge step forward. We need to continue to impart this momentum by achieving an ambitious agreement at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris.
As for the peace and security pillar, it affords us an opportunity to strengthen the United Nations, especially with regard to the protection of the civilian population. Switzerland is convinced that one cannot resolve a conflict through a purely military approach. The United Nations must base each of its actions on a political strategy aimed at finding a lasting solution to the conflict. That self-evident truth was apparent during the various peace and dialogue processes conducted in Geneva on Syria, Libya, Iran and Yemen.
As for the review of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), Switzerland will continue its effort to promote the participation of women in peace processes. We must also grant women more responsibility when it comes to security-related issues. Their involvement contributes to the duribility of peace agreements by expanding the agenda of negotiations and by improving the population’s commitment to such agreements.
The United Nations will review its global counter- terrorism strategy during the summer of 2016. The implementation of this strategy is a priority for Switzerland, especially the parts relating to terrorism prevention and respect for human rights and international humanitarian law.
Finally, Switzerland is also convinced that a strong United Nations is a United Nations capable of taking action and decisions when international peace and security are under threat. In this connection, we reiterate our long-standing call to the members of the Security Council not to block or vote against any resolution aimed at preventing or putting an end to crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes.
Human rights are the third pillar of the United Nations. Here, Switzerland is proud to be seeking election to the Human Rights Council for the 2016-2018 term. Switzerland’s priorities on human rights are the
abolition of the death penalty, the implementation of the prohibition of torture, the promotion of women’s and children’s rights, and the protection of human rights defenders. It is also essential that the perpetrators of human rights violations be brought to justice. Switzerland here wishes to recall the important role played by the International Criminal Court in the fight against impunity.
As far as the humanitarian system is concerned, it has clearly reached its limits as a result of the growing number, longer duration and increasing complexity of crises. So far this year, 82 million people have required immediate humanitarian assistance. That is an unprecedented number. The World Humanitarian Summit, which is to be held in Istanbul in May 2016, will afford us an opportunity to improve the efficiency of the humanitarian system in order to enable it to better and more effectively respond to victims’ needs.
In December, Geneva will host the thirty-second International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. That will be an important opportunity to make progress towards the creation of an institutional framework in which to discuss how we can improve compliance with international humanitarian law.
Let us continue to work together to build a modern and effective United Nations by reforming its governance. In this context, Geneva, as one of the main centres of global governance, has an essential role to play. The United Nations can count on the full support of my country, Switzerland, to strengthen it during the next 70 years."
70,2015,NAM,"I am honoured to be here today to deliver my maiden address to the General Assembly as the third President of the Republic of Namibia. I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. In the same vein, let me take this opportunity to thank the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for the sterling job he did during his tenure as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.
As I arrived at this building, I could not help but experience a strong sense of nostalgia. It has been said that a journey of 1,000 miles begins with one step. In 1964, 51 years ago, standing at the foot of the steps to this building, I began my 1,000-mile journey, starting off as a young petitioner for the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO) against the illegal occupation of South West Africa by apartheid South Africa. On 23 April 1990, I returned to address the Assembly as the first Prime Minister of an independent Namibia during the admission of our young nation into the fold of the United Nations family (see A/S-18/PV.1). Today, 25 years after that moment, I am once again standing in this building, having ascended to the presidency of our Republic. It is therefore a great joy to
4/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
be present at the seventieth anniversary celebrations of our Organization.
Namibia is a child of international solidarity, midwifed by the United Nations. As Namibians, we are both grateful for and proud of the support we received from the international community, through the United Nations system, during our struggle for independence. In fact, if I can illustrate our close bond with the United Nations, in 1990, upon attaining independence, we refused to allow the instruments of power to be handed over to our first President, Comrade Sam Nujoma, by the then President of South Africa, Mr. De Klerk. We demanded that the said instruments be handed over by Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, who in so doing symbolized the birth of our Republic.
After the termination of South Africa’s mandate over South West Africa, the United Nations assumed direct responsibility over Namibia. Furthermore, it established the Nationhood Programme for Namibia, which was meant to prepare the country for independence and future responsibilities. Through the United Nations Institute for Namibia, established by the United Nations Council for Namibia, which I was tasked to head from 1975 to 1989, we were able to develop the building blocks that we would use to construct our democracy. There is an African proverb which says that a patient man will eat ripe fruit. With the assistance of the United Nations, we exercised patience in preparing for self-governance. Today, I can proudly announce to the world that in Namibia, after having fought to free ourselves, we are now eating the ripe fruit of peace and democracy.
As an expression of our profound gratitude to the international community for its solidarity with our people and our undying commitment to international peace and security, we have continued to make our modest contribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations since our independence. Among other things, we have contributed contingents to peacekeeping missions in Cambodia, Angola, Liberia, Darfur, Côte d’Ivoire, Timor-Leste and South Sudan, in which our men and women participated.
As we celebrate 70 years of the existence of this great experiment in human interaction, namely, our United Nations, there is a lot of which we can be proud. Although the world has not been as peaceful as we would like, we can take solace in the fact that since the Second World War, we have avoided a conflict of such
magnitude and intensity. Most important are the inroads we have made into improving the conditions of human beings on this planet by lifting millions out of extreme poverty, empowering women, advancing human rights, and spearheading the process of decolonization, which has been completed with only one exception — that of Sahrawi.
We hail from a continent whose leaders are busy addressing new goals and new commitments under the banner of the African Union. We are in the process of establishing the new Africa, with its own narrative as told by its sons and daughters. Africa has turned a new leaf, bidding farewell to the days of coups d’état and embracing electoral democracy. We as Africans, through the African Union, have ostracized those who have come to office through unlawful ways. The recent coup in Burkina Faso is an example of our zero- tolerance policy towards those who come to power through illegal ways.
Having achieved electoral democracy, it is pertinent that we buttress it by establishing processes, systems and institutions. When we talk about processes, we are referring mainly to electoral processes, in which electoral commissions need to be independent, impartial and able to instil confidence in the electorate. This will ensure that those who lose at the polls accept the results. In so doing, we can bring to an end a situation where those who lose at the polls feel left out and defeated and therefore choose to wage war.
With respect to systems, we talk about Government systems that continue to function through the civil service even though there may be a political deadlock within a particular country. If all else fails, then institutions, such as our own courts, play their part. This is what we have in Namibia. It is clear, therefore, that we have put sound governance architecture in place. With regard to effective governance, our track record speaks volumes. We are rated, inter alia, sixth overall as the best-governed country on the African continent by the Ibrahim Index of African Governance, rated seventh in Africa as a clean country in terms of corruption by Transparency International, and ranked as a country with the freest press in Africa by Reporters without Borders.
Similarly, our macroeconomic architecture is admirable. It is underpinned by financial stability evident in our world-class banking system — a sector ranked twenty-fifth in the world by the World Economic
15-29431 5/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
Forum — and well regulated through a prudent monetary policy for the past 25 years. Both Fitch and Standard and Poor’s, the globally recognized rating experts on a country’s financial stability, have consistently rated Namibia with a BBB+, which means that we are indeed a credit-worthy country. Our debt stock is between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Clearly, at the level of governance, Namibia by all local and international standards has been doing quite well as a maturing, stable, peaceful and democratic society.
However, we should understand that electoral democracy without economic democracy is meaningless, because people do not eat peace, security, good constitutions and democracy. We still face the challenge of rectifying socioeconomic deficits and the subsequent entrenched poverty caused by many years of deliberately orchestrated policies of the historic neglect and economic exclusion of black people. That situation has proven resilient against the conventional anti-poverty strategies we have employed for the past 25 years, meaning that we have to become more innovative in our approach in that area. We are still faced with enormous social disparities between the rich and the poor. Among other notable concerns is the critical shortage of housing and other basic necessities. For that reason, on the day of my inauguration as President of Namibia on 21 March, I announced to my countrymen and women and to the world at large that the Namibian Government was declaring an all-out war on poverty.
The distribution of wealth is one of today’s most widely discussed and controversial issues. However, the distribution of wealth is too important an issue to be left to economists at international financial institutions. It is for that reason that Namibia continues to advise caution against the arbitrary classification of countries based on income alone. The current approach developed by international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and subsequently adopted by the United Nations, to classify countries based solely on GDP does not reflect justice and fairness. That approach, which simply divides GDP by population, completely ignores inequalities in the distribution of wealth and opportunities and comes with adverse effects on social mobility and progress.
Namibia has been one of the casualties of that approach, as it has been wrongly classified as a so- called upper-middle-income country without taking into account that, due to Apartheid, the economic
wealth of the country remained in the hands of the minority white population, leaving blacks on the fringes of the economy. Instead of the international community assisting us in fighting the second phase of the struggle, we feel as if we have been left to fend for ourselves since the aforementioned classification effectively denies Namibia access to grants and concessional loans to support our development agenda.
One cannot build a nation when some citizens do not participate in the economy and therefore feel left out. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen rightly states that poverty should be seen as the deprivation of basic capabilities rather than merely as low income. The deprivation of elementary capabilities can be reflected in premature mortality; significant undernourishment, especially of children; persistent morbidity; widespread illiteracy and other failures. We can therefore see that the effects of poverty are so interrelated that those among us who have the misfortune of being poor are trapped in perpetual cycles of poverty and despair.
Further to the issue of poverty eradication, I would like to add that one of the most impactful interventions we can make in the war against poverty is by empowering women, who, although representing half of the world’s population, account for nearly 70 per cent of the world’s poor. In Namibia, gender equality is not merely lip service. We have benefitted from SWAPO’s internal reform of its party list system to include the 50-50 per cent representation of women. Due to the SWAPO victory at the national electoral polls, female representation in our Parliament has increased from 24 per cent to 47 per cent, second only to Rwanda, which has up to 64 per cent female representation in its Parliament. I have promised that we shall catch up.
I have also appointed a Namibia’s first female Prime Minister, and a female Deputy Prime Minister who also serves as our Minister for International Relations and Cooperation. She is present in the Assembly today. Furthermore, I have appointed female Ministers at the helm of our Basic and Higher Education Ministries. Both the Minister and Deputy Minister are females. What matters is educating us when we are young; we think that by placing education under their care that we will do better.
The current, reflective seventieth session of the General Assembly has charted the course for the future with the adoption, two days ago, of the new Sustainable Development Goals, which urge us all to join hands
6/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
to build a new type of international relations based on win-win cooperation in order to realize the lofty ideals of living together in peace with one another as good neighbours. The onus is on us to ensure that this seventieth session marks the beginning of a unified commitment to establishing peace in all areas of the world. Let us ensure that no country feels left out of that process.
Human rights are not divisible; fundamental freedoms are not divisible; democracy is not divisible; self-determination is not divisible. These freedoms apply to all of us as human beings on this planet. The peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara should be allowed to enjoy their inalienable rights to self- determination and national independence, just like all other people, because those rights are not divisible; they apply to all of us.
Namibia therefore reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine and of the Western Sahara to self- determination and national independence. In that context, we call upon the United Nations to assume its full responsibility by implementing all its resolutions and decisions on Palestine with no preconditions. We equally call for the urgent implementation of all Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, with the aim of holding a free and fair referendum in the Western Sahara.
There have been a number of developments on the geopolitical landscape that are encouraging in terms of a more safe and peaceful world. One of those developments is the thawing of relations between the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America. For the past 25 years, Namibia has continued to call for the United States and Cuba to walk the 15 miles of peaceful coexistence. In that regard, we applaud the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, as well as the laudable efforts of the two leaders to ease political tension. We commend both countries for realizing that their differences are best addressed through engagement rather than estrangement. However, we hope that the first step will be followed by the unconditional lifting of the embargo imposed on the people of Cuba.
Over the 70 years of its existence, the United Nations has evolved with the world as new issues and challenges have emerged. It is therefore proper for the Organization to reposition itself to deal with these
dynamic changes. Accordingly, Namibia remains committed to comprehensive United Nations reform in order to strengthen the Organization and make it more efficient and responsive to the needs of all its Members. In this regard, reforms of the United Nations system should be guided by the principles of democracy, equity, justice and fairness for all.
With respect to reform of the Security Council, Namibia fully supports the African Common Position as set forth in the Ezulwini Consensus and reaffirmed by declaration at the 25th Ordinary Summit of the African Union. The continent of Africa deserves to be fairly and equitably represented in the Security Council in order to rectify the long historical injustice endured by a continent with over 1 billion people.
As President of the eleventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Namibia is of the view that we will not end poverty unless we tackle the interlinked issues of desertification, land degradation and drought. These issues are of critical importance, not only to Namibia and Africa, but for the entire world.
As we prepare to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the creation of the Organization, an organization with which so many of us here share a history and fond memories during our struggle for freedom and dignity, we must ensure that we leave a legacy behind for future generations — a legacy of peace, unity and the commitment to equitable and sustainable development. I would like to reflect on the words of the former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who once said,
“More than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together (SG/SM/7262).
And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations. The only way we can overcome our challenges is to form a united front for the advancement of humankind. Through the United Nations we have the platform to achieve this goal. We can either choose to march to the tune set by the original ideals that led to the formation of the United Nations or we can choose to pursue our ambitions at the expense of others and ourselves. Let us choose nobility, where we overcome our fears, insecurities and prejudices for the sake of shared sustainable development. Let us leave a long- lasting legacy that will shape the future of our planet politically, economically and ecologically.

The time to act is now, and Namibia stands ready to join hands with all members of the international community to celebrate a new type of global coexistence, where no continent, no region and no country will feel left out.
"
70,2015,CUB,"It was 70 years ago that, on behalf on their peoples, the first Member States of the Organization signed the Charter of the United Nations. We pledged ourselves to preserve future generations from the scourge of war and to build a new type of relationship, guided by a set of purposes and principles that sought to bring about an era of peace, justice and development for all of humanity.
However, from that moment there have constantly been wars of aggression and interference in the internal affairs of States, the ousting of sovereign Governments
by force, so-called soft coups and the recolonization of territories — all perfected by unconventional ways of acting, using new technologies and under the pretext of alleged human rights violations. The militarization of cyberspace and the covert and illegal use of information and communication technologies to attack other States are unacceptable, as is the distortion of the advancement and protection of human rights when used in a selective and discriminatory approach to validate and impose political decisions.
Despite the fact that the Charter calls on us to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person, for millions of people the fulfilment of human rights remains a utopia. Humankind has been denied the right to live in peace and the right to development. It is actually in poverty and inequality that the cause of conflicts should be sought — conflicts that were earlier generated by colonialism and the plundering of regional peoples, and later by imperialism and the distribution of spheres of influence.
The commitment made in 1945 to promoting social progress and better standards of living for the peoples, along with their economic and social development, remains an illusion when 795 million people go hungry, when 781 million adults are illiterate, and when 17,000 children perish every day from curable diseases. In the meantime, annual military expenditures worldwide amount to more than $1.7 trillion. Barely a fraction of that figure could actually resolve the most pressing problems afflicting humankind. Even in industrial nations, the welfare society, which was presented as the model to imitate, has practically disappeared. The election systems and the traditional parties, which rely on money and publicity, are growing increasingly detached and distant from the aspirations of their peoples.
Climate change is threatening the very existence of the human species. States should assume common but differentiated responsibilities, in view of the indisputable reality that not all countries are equally accountable for what has happened. Not all of us waste natural and human resources through irrational and unsustainable consumerism. The consequences of climate change are particularly for small island developing States and additional tensions to their fragile economies. The same is happening in Africa with the relentless advance of desertification.
We stand in solidarity with our Caribbean brothers and demand that they be treated in a special and differentiated way. We also support the African countries and demand fair treatment for them, as well as the transfer of technology and financial resources.
With the establishment of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and especially the signing by the CELAC Heads of State and Government in January 2014 of the Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace, we have shown that we can move beyond our differences toward unity and the achievement of common goals in the framework of our diversity.
In the Proclamation we reaffirm our steadfast commitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in international law to settle disputes by peaceful means and our belief that full respect for the inalienable right of each State to choose its political, economic, social and cultural system is an essential condition for ensuring peaceful coexistence among nations. We demand that those principles be the basis for relations with other States in our region.
The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela can always rely on the solidarity of Cuba vis-à-vis the attempts at destabilization and subversion of its constitutional order and the destruction of the work begun by Comrade Hugo Chávez Frías and pursued by President Nicolás Maduro Moros for the benefit of the Venezuelan people. Likewise, our firm and unlimited solidarity goes to the Republic of Ecuador, its citizens’ revolution and its leader Rafael Correa Delgado, who has become the target of the same destabilization script applied against other progressive Governments in the region.
We stand in solidarity with the Caribbean nations demanding fair reparation for the horrors of slavery and the slave trade, above all in a world where racial discrimination and repression of communities of people of African descent have increased. We also reaffirm our conviction that the people of Puerto Rico deserve to be free and independent after more than a century of colonial domination. We stand in solidarity with the Argentine Republic in its fair claim of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich islands.
We reiterate our support for and solidarity with President Dilma Rousseff and the Brazilian people in defence of their major social achievements and the stability of their country.
We reaffirm our rejection of the intention to expand the presence of NATO up to the Russian borders, as well as the unilateral and unjust sanctions imposed on that nation.
We welcome the so-called nuclear agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, which proves that engagement and negotiations are the only effective tools for settling disputes between States. We renew our confidence that the Syrian people are capable of solving their disputes by themselves and demand an end to external interference in that country.
A fair and lasting solution of the Middle East conflict unquestionably requires the true exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable right to build their own State within the borders existing prior to 1967, with its capital in East Jerusalem, which we strongly support.
Over the past few weeks, we have been moved by the images of waves of migration toward Europe. That is a direct result of the destabilizing actions promoted and executed by NATO in countries of the Middle East and North Africa, as well as of the poverty and underdevelopment prevailing in the countries of the African continent. The European Union should take full and immediate responsibility for the human crisis that it helped to generate.
After 56 years, during which the Cuban people put up heroic and selfless resistance, diplomatic relations have been re-established between Cuba and the United States of America. Now, a long and complex process begins towards the normalization of relations. But that will be achieved only with the end of the economic, commercial and financial blockade against Cuba, the return to our country of the territory illegally occupied by the Guantanamo naval base, and the cessation of radio and television broadcasts and of subversive and destabilizing programmes against the island. Our people should also be compensated for the human and economic damage that they still endure.
While the blockade remains in force, we shall continue introducing the draft resolution entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba”. To all the 188 Governments and peoples that have sponsored our just demand here
and in other international regional forums, we reiterate the eternal appreciation of the Cuban people and Government for their continued support.
Cuba is celebrating with profound commitment the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. Despite the efforts that have been made throughout those years, not enough has been done to save present and future generations from the scourge of war and to protect their right to sustainable development without exclusions. The United Nations should be defended from unilateralism and should be deeply reformed to democratize it and bring it closer to the peoples.
As Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz, the historic leader of the Cuban revolution, stated in this same Hall 15 years ago
“Everyone understands that the United Nations basic role in the new century now upon us is to save the world not only from war but also from underdevelopment, hunger, diseases, poverty and the destruction of the natural resources indispensable to human life. And the United Nations must do this promptly — before it is too late.” The international community can always depend on Cuba to raise its honest voice against injustice, inequality, underdevelopment, discrimination and manipulation and for the establishment of a more equitable and fair international order that really focuses on the human being, his dignity and well-being.
"
70,2015,SEN,"Senegal, through me, warmly congratulates the President and wishes him every success in conducting the work of this session. We thank his Ugandan predecessor for his service to the Assembly.
Seventy years after the creation of our Organization, we are walking in the footsteps of the founding fathers to renew our collective faith in the ideals of peace, security, development and respect for human rights. Those values inspire the principal mission of the Organization of preserving the world from the scourge of war, creating the conditions necessary to the maintenance of justice, promoting social progress and ensuring a better standard of living in greater freedom.
Seventy years later, that mission has become more burdensome and our world increasingly complex. Seventy years on, peace, which is not only the absence of war, but also development and human security, remains threatened by extreme poverty, hunger, disease and the unprecedented degradation of the environment.
It is Senegal’s hope that the Paris Climate Change Conference will be successful and adopt binding commitments to controlling global warming and mobilizing adequate financial resources and transfers of environmentally friendly technologies.
We face other changes, because the world is still struggling to overcome the hideous mask of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and violent extremism. Human beings are being targeted, rejected and attacked due merely to the color of their skin, their beliefs or social background. Migrant workers are being discriminated against and excluded from public policies, even though they are contributing by the sweat of their brow to the prosperity of their host country. No country can be indifferent to the tragedy of war.
As a welcoming and hospitable country, Senegal appeals for greater openness and generosity for migrants. These are individuals who have been forced to leave their countries in a quest to save their lives.
Indeed, we face many urgent problems. Nonetheless, the promise of a better world is still within our reach, and we can achieve it if we accept that this is a plural world, that all cultures and civilizations are equal in dignity and that change is the main dynamic that shapes the course of history.
Over the years, 142 countries have joined the 51 founding Members of the Organization. Through the wealth of their contributions and the diversity of their needs, Member States confer an unequalled degree of universality upon the United Nations system. The world in 2015 is therefore not the same as the world of 1945, and if we wish to keep the promises made in the Charter of the United Nations, we must abandon our old ways of

doing business. Common sense requires that we change our vision of the present and of the future. That is what will ensure that our Organization will remain faithful to its vocation as the unique hub where our efforts can work together towards a common end.
It makes sense to enlarge the Security Council to ensure that it reflects these new realities that we all represent here. Senegal, which is a candidate this year for a non-permanent seat on the Council, reasserts its commitment to the African Common Position on Security Council reform, in line with the Ezulwini Consensus. It makes sense to reform global economic and financial governance through a more equitable representation of the new realities and greater flexibility with regard to access to credit, to put an end to the paradox of resources that are available but not accessible. In our mining industries, it makes sense to establish, along with transparency, codes and contracts that are fairer and more equitable, reward and protect the investor and preserve the interests of States and local populations. It makes sense to combat more vigorously illicit financial flows that cost Africa between $30 billion and $60 billion per year — a loss that is more than official development assistance. If Africa were to receive fair payment for its resources and recover the equivalent of 17 per cent of those assets that have been fraudulently invested abroad, it could settle the entirety of its debt and finance its own development needs.
As the current President of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), I am pleased to say that our subregion has continued on the path of progress. Economic growth remains above the global average and our democracy, in spite of everything, is being consolidated. We are also determined to pursue our efforts for peace and stability. I reiterate the unfailing commitment of ECOWAS to the Peace Agreement in Mali, while respecting national unity and the territorial integrity of the country, and to a successful transition in Burkina Faso. I call upon the international community and the Security Council in particular, to remain attentive to Burkina Faso. We also support Nigeria and other countries in their fight against Boko Haram. We support stable institutions in Guinea-Bissau. We will also continue to work together to eradicate the remnants of the Ebola virus in affected countries. As Chair of the Oslo Group on foreign policy and global health, Senegal will hold consultations during this session to draw the lessons from this health crisis.
As we move forward on the path of peace, we must strive towards a comprehensive, fair and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict pursuant to the vision of two independent States living in peace within secure and internationally recognized borders. Throughout the world, peace is our common good. Along with democracy, human rights and cultural diversity, it is the corpus of values of the International Organization of La Francophonie, of which Senegal is currently holding the presidency. Our commitment to these ideals makes Senegal the seventh-largest troop contributor to peacekeeping operations among 128 countries. It has more than 3,600 troops deployed in eight missions.
Last year, the Security Council established a medal in memory of my compatriot, the late Captain Mbaye Diagne, to honour the men and women who, in serving peace, have demonstrated exceptional courage. As a member of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda, Captain Diagne was killed on 31 May 1994 when a shell exploded as he was returning from one of his many rescue missions in the field. He was just 36 years old and was ready to go home. Senegal and his family are proud that his memory will be honoured in this manner. We have a wise saying in my country — man alone can save man — that heightens our sense of human solidarity and fraternity. May the spirit of Captain Mbaye Diagne inspire our joint march towards a better world of peace that is more just and welcoming for everyone."
70,2015,MDA,"I am most delighted and indeed honoured to represent my country for the first time at this high rostrum and to address the General Assembly at this anniversary session. The seventieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations gives us the opportunity to learn lessons from the past and to reflect on the ways and means we need to face today’s and tomorrow’s challenges and build together a better future for the coming generations.
We are all proud that today the United Nations remains the leader in maintaining peace and security and promoting sustainable development and human rights. The Organization also remains durably at the core of effective multilateralism, the prominent confirmation of which is the outcome document ( resolution 70/1) of the United Nations Summit on the adoption of the post- 2015 development agenda, held a few days ago here in New York.
In that respect, I have great pleasure in highlighting the fact that, throughout the entire preparatory process and during the Summit, the Republic of Moldova advocated the adoption of the new development road map, which bears on the present and future of our planet. The integration of the economic, social and environmental pillars of the new framework Agenda is the key to an old issue that the United Nations has debated for years — the essence of sustainable development and how to put it into practice.
With the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations and its Member States are engaging in an advanced model of sustainable development for humankind that will address poverty and inequality and combat climate change. We support the United Nations and Member States’ initiatives and actions directed at addressing climate change through ambitious measures to promote clean power at the national and international levels. We believe that if everyone put their shoulders to the wheel, we would be more likely to reach the targets and create a better world.
The Republic of Moldova is making its own contribution to the effort. The Sustainable Development Goals constitute an important chapter in the governing programme for the future. Among many of our endeavours, we seek to increase the ratio of domestic renewable energy consumption to 20 per cent by 2020 and to promote a green economy. My country is on track to ratify the Low-Emission Development

Strategies and Plans and, at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, intends to support the European Union’s mechanisms for reaching these goals. Moreover, the implementation of the European Union-Moldova Association Agreement, concluded last year in Brussels along with the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) as its component part, represents the strategic direction that complements our sustainable development efforts.
The European Union agenda and the United Nations commitments go hand in hand and embody our affiliation with the universality of goals and responsibilities for development and peace by way of embracing European core values and principles and strengthening our partnerships in the region. The first anniversary of our Association Agreement with the European Union entitles us to assert that the progress achieved in different fields confirms once again the sagacity of the choice made by the Republic of Moldova on its way forward to European integration. The gradual implementation of the Association Agreement and the creation of the DCFTA zone have brought us politically and economically closer to the European Union and helped us to advance in the development and modernization of the country and of Moldovan society in the spirit of European and universal values.
Although the Republic of Moldova, given its geographical position and dimensions, does not often manage to influence the international agenda, our experience in migration managing, gained during the implementation of the action plan for liberalizing the visa regime and the Mobility Partnership, allowed us to become, inter alia, an important voice in the Global Forum on Migration and Development and in the discussions on the United Nations post-2015 development agenda.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done. Reiterating the commitment assumed by the Republic of Moldova to continuing reforms and bringing the country into the big European family, we are fully open to a further efficient dialogue with our European partners on the implementation of our priorities, including macrofinancial stabilization, reform of the judiciary and prosecution systems, the fight against corruption, deepening reform of public administration, education and social areas, and the consolidation of cooperation in ensuring energy security and the interconnection of transport networks. This progress has been achieved
with the help of our development partners, and we are grateful to the European Union and its member States, especially our neighbour, Romania, and to the United States for their continued financial and technical assistance and unprecedented political support.
From the same perspective, in attaining the strategic objectives of European integration and the sustainable socioeconomic development of the country we also count on the support of all development partners and United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies. In this respect, the cooperation and assistance programmes of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are of invaluable importance to my country. We firmly believe that, with the support and assistance of our development partners, we will firmly pursue the path of European integration.
The world we live in is becoming increasingly turbulent and unsafe. Illegitimate military force and other forms of violence are widely used by States and non-State actors as a means to promote their interests. Gross violations of international law and a dramatic decrease in trust among States have already undermined the central pillars of the international system.
Regrettably, after a period of relative stability, the system of security and cooperation in Europe has been seriously shaken. The annexation of Crimean by the Russian Federation, in flagrant violation of international law, and the outbreak of armed conflict in the eastern regions of the Ukraine have directly challenged international peace and security. These major negative developments have reactivated a fundamental question on our agenda: What should be done to restore order and ensure respect for the norms and principles of international law?
The search for an answer will take time, but this exercise is very much needed. In the meantime, it is critical to bring the military hostilities in the Donbas region of Ukraine to an end. The continuation of the conflict will cause more suffering, more victims and more destroyed infrastructure. There is one simple truth to be kept in mind — the longer a conflict goes on, the harder it is to find a sustainable solution. In this respect, the Republic of Moldova supports the peaceful settlement of the conflict in Donbas in accordance with the Minsk agreements and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Ukraine. We express our solidarity with the Ukrainian people at this difficult time.

The Republic of Moldova has also gone through a conflict. For more than two decades, my country has been divided as a result of the Transnistrian conflict. But in spite of external and domestic challenges, the Republic of Moldova will firmly pursue the peaceful settlement of this conflict. By restoring trust and promoting dialogue, we should move step by step to a comprehensive resolution of the Transnistrian conflict. The solution should be based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova, and on identifying a special status for the Transnistrian region within the internationally recognized borders of my country. We express our hope that all our external partners will make efforts to advance the conflict-resolution process towards that goal.
Additionally, we reiterate our firm position with regard to the imperative of Russia’s withdrawing its military forces and munitions from the territory of the Republic of Moldova, in accordance with the constitutional provisions of my country and international commitments. In the same context, we believe that the existing peacekeeping operation has fulfilled its mandate and needs to be transformed into a civilian mission with a relevant international mandate.
The Republic of Moldova fully supports all measures taken by the United Nations in the field of combating international terrorism, promoting disarmament and non-proliferation, and pleads for the active participation of all Member States in their implementation. My country has ratified and our delegation has deposited with the Secretary-General its ratification instrument of the Arms Trade Treaty. The Treaty should not only ensure transparency and accountability in transfers of conventional weapons, but should also prevent illicit arms trafficking, especially to unrecognized separatist entities. In the context of the complex security situation in the Eastern European region, this is of vital importance.
Being convinced that the security deterioration in our region calls for an effective mechanism for small arms and light weapons control, we are also engaged in implementing the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, and support the relevant Security Council resolutions. Today, we are pleased to state that during the past three years, with the support of our partners, we have
succeeded in destroying all stocks of cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines in our country.
We also share the international community’s concerns about the emergence of new terrorist threats to our democratic values, human rights and world peace. As a sponsor of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters, the Republic of Moldova is in favour of the adoption of appropriate measures for its implementation. In the same vein, apart from the fact that the Republic of Moldova has participated for many years with military observers in United Nations peacekeeping operations in Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, the Sudan, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, starting from 2014 our country has contributed a contingent of more than 40 servicemen to the multinational peacekeeping Kosovo Force.
During the past year, important progress has also been made in cooperating with the European Union in the field of a common security and defence policy, particularly by participating for the first time in the European Union-led crisis management missions and operations including the European Union Training Mission in Mali in 2014 and the European Union Military Advisory Mission in the Central African Republic in 2015. Thus, the Republic of Moldova is transitioning from being a security observer and beneficiary to becoming an active participant and contributor to establishing security building, peace and stability in Europe and in the world. As a European Union-associated State, the Republic of Moldova is determined to contribute to the consolidation of the European Union’s position as a regional and global actor.
When humankind is confronted with deepening crises, raising increasing human rights implications, and the needs of people are evolving, United Nations expertise and independent assessment are crucial. Especially for that reason, the Republic of Moldova welcomes the innovative approach of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to brief Member States on new developments in a prompt manner, which will contribute to strengthening prevention and early warning. My country stands for universal respect for the principles of international law and human rights that arise from their indivisibility and interdependence, and believes that ensuring the availability of efficient, solid and rapid reaction mechanisms to foster respect for and
15-29701 9/28

A/70/PV.21 30/09/2015
promote fundamental freedoms without exception is of crucial importance.
The seventieth anniversary could and should become an influential incentive for further real reforms and for the reaffirmation and strengthening of the role and work of the United Nations. We welcome and support every concrete effort directed at ensuring the reform of all United Nations structures, including the General Assembly, its subsidiary bodies, the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council, with the purpose of enhancing their efficiency, effectiveness, accountability, transparency and equitable regional representation. Along this line, we particularly reiterate previously expressed positions on the imperative of allocating one non-permanent seat in a reformed Security Council to the Eastern European Group of States and of ensuring equitable regional rotation in the process of the election of the Secretary-General by entrusting for the first time the highest position in the Secretariat to a national coming from an Eastern European country.
Finally, having had this privilege of congratulating the entire United Nations family on the seventieth anniversary of the Organization, we express our conviction that all Member States will further engage by uniting efforts and resources to confront the new threats and challenges, thereby safeguarding peace, humanity and our planet, as the founders of the United Nations urged us to do. Pledging to constructively contribute to the attainment of this noble assignment, my delegation and my country are confident that this anniversary session will lead to the advancement of sustainable peace and development and to environmental and human rights protection for the benefit of the world.
"
70,2015,ARG,"At the outset, allow me to welcome a very relevant event that took place here a few days ago — on 10 September — when, by 136 votes in favour, the General Assembly approved the Basic Principles on Sovereign Debt Restructuring Processes (resolution 69/319). That was a very significant triumph.
New principles have been established — which I have written down here so that I do not forget any of them — that should guide how we address and resolve matters when a country has decided to renegotiate its external debt. They include the sovereignty of a country to decide its own macroeconomic policies and how it will restructure its debt; good faith, transparency, impartiality, and equitable treatment so as not to distinguish among different creditors and so that everybody is treated in the same manner. They also include sovereign immunity from jurisdiction and execution, as well as legitimacy and sustainability.
The latter is perhaps one of the most important principles, as it refers to repaying and honouring one’s debts — not at the cost hunger and poverty for the people, but through a political and economic project and through macroeconomic variables that should make the development and growth of society sustainable.
Finally comes perhaps the most important principle lacking today in terms of regulation of sovereign debt. It is a logical principle that applies in nearly all the domestic legal systems throughout the world. When a company goes bankrupt and is unable to pay its debts in any country — including in this one, the United States of America, where municipalities are also allowed to go bankrupt — how is consensus reached? Through a qualified majority. When 66 per cent of the creditors here in the United States, and also in my own country of the Argentine Republic, come to an agreement with the debtor with regard to timetables and the form of the payment, that becomes law and is mandatory for the other creditors. Let me repeat, when 66 per cent agree. That principle also enshrines the idea that when the majority decides on a form of payment, that should be accepted by everybody else.
This agreement — these principles and conventions — was approved here, and we have decided to submit it to our parliament for it to become an instrument of public order that controls our country’s domestic practices. It has its roots in the default that Argentina experienced in 2000, history’s largest sovereign default. At that time the world was growing by more than good rates. However, Argentina went bankrupt as a result of debts that had been incurred much earlier. In fact, to be more accurate, it began in earnest in 1976, when there was a coup d’état and the country’s constitutional order was overthrown, and began to deepen in the 1990s with the convertibility regime, by which they made us Argentines believe that an Argentine peso was worth $l. That culminated in the 2001 default and in institutional bankruptcy: there were five different Governments in just one week.
Argentina, however, was able to rebuild its economy and its society when politics once again took control over the economy starting on 25 May 2003. It was then decided to summon creditors to a first restructuring offer in 2005, and again in 2010 under my presidency. The first restructuring was during the presidency of Néstor Carlos Kirchner, who in his first address to the General Assembly (see A/58/PV.11) said that the dead did not pay their debts and that it was necessary for the creditors to allow Argentina to grow in order to be able to pay. That was neither a premonition on his part nor a matter of foretelling the future. He simply applied economic logic: it was impossible to pay a debt in the absence of growth in the economy of the debtor country. That is when Argentina began its inexorable process of getting out of debt.
But it also had to do with what happened in 2005, when it was decided to pay off the total debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which had been imposing macroeconomic policies on our country. That is when Argentina began to grow and linked itself up as yet another wagon to the locomotive engine of the emerging countries, which were the ones that had been supporting the sustained growth of the international economy. Let us not forget that the greatest growth was led by the emerging countries, essentially headed by the giants of Asia.
During my first address to the General Assembly as President of the Argentine Republic, in September
2008 (see A/63/PV.5), I noted how the locomotive that was driving the world to sustained growth had another locomotive engine added to it. Like those old trains with two locomotive engines, this one now also had two: China and the rest of the emerging countries, pulling towards growth with rates that in the case of China had already attained 14 per cent growth in gross domestic product by 2007.
Then in 2008, with the fall of Lehman Brothers on Wall Street, came an economic crisis that we are still experiencing, but with several differences. Although it began here at the very heart of international finance, there had in fact been signs of a crisis, namely, the 2007 sub-prime mortgage crisis, which ultimately exploded in 2008. The year 2009 marked the global economic collapse, except in Asian countries. Even in Latin America, we experienced negative growth that year. In 2010 the crisis spread to the eurozone, and off they went to the rescue of indebted countries. We all know that was a euphemism; the banks were actually the ones they went to rescue. Billions of dollars were transferred to banking institutions. I still remember a discussion that took place in London at the Group of 20. Our position was that, while it was necessary to save the banks to stave off a 1930s-type depression, it was also absolutely essential that there be regulation so that the tide of resources that was being injected into the financial sector should flow back to the real economy, enter the goods and services production cycle and make the wheels of growth turn again.
But none of that happened. Indeed, on the contrary, adjustment policies were the consideration in exchange for being rescued. And the adjustment policy imposed on the eurozone caused a recession in that zone and a drop in employment to unprecedented lows: 50 per cent of young people in Italy unemployed, with double-digit unemployment in Spain as well.
That is how we got to 2014 and 2015, with a sharp decrease in global demand. Now we see how that crisis train — the Lehman Brothers locomotive engine, which departed from here, in the heart of Wall Street, and stopped off in Europe — is trying to move on to the emerging economies, we who underpinned economic growth for so long. Argentina was and is part of that growth. This year, despite difficulties and the harassment by vulture funds, which do not collect nor do they allow the 92.7 per cent that agreed to the two restructurings to collect, with the complicity 
of a certain part of this country’s judiciary, there are demands that
we pay 7 per cent of the creditors $20 billion, when the restructuring accepted by the 92 per cent had amounted to $40 billion.
What is the capitalistic logic behind this? What is the mathematical model for this? How long would it take us to restructure those 93 per cent if we met the demands of these predatory financiers, who make up only 7 per cent of the creditors, and paid them half of what we paid to 92 per cent of the creditors? Any logical judge would say that was not right. One cannot pay to 7 per cent of the creditors half of what one pays the other 92 per cent of the creditors, particularly when some of the 7 per cent had bought lots of these bonds after Argentina had already defaulted on its external debt.
It is for that reason that the approval of the Basic Principles on Sovereign Debt Restructuring Processes — for which there are some precedents already through anti-vulture laws such as those in the Kingdom of Belgium — represents help, not to Argentina, which is depositing 100 per cent of its debt to its creditors, but help to the rest of the world. It is the first serious attempt to introduce fairness and regulation to the financial and derivatives sectors, which, from the moment that merchant banks became investment banks, have remained outside the scope of all oversight and intervention.
That is why we say that what was agreed on 10 September was a very significant and major step forward that must also be in line with the fact that the world is not doing well at all. That is not news to anyone. We could talk about the refugee crisis resulting from the action of financial predators in countries that do not manage to support their people who have to migrate to Europe in canoes or rafts from Africa, or about the refugees who have to flee their homelands because of warlords.
I also want to talk to the Assembly about an unprecedented process of economic concentration that is unheard of in the world. According to the most recently released IMF report, 1 per cent of the global population at present is holding 50 per cent of the wealth. Here, in this very country that once hosted the American dream — the dream of the American middle classes, which encouraged and continues to encourage so many Latin Americans to come here — 1 per cent have more than 30 per cent of the total wealth. How long can such a society or the world continue when income
distribution is that unfair and with all the consequences of such unfairness?
Yesterday, at President Xi Jinping’s gender equality meeting, we pondered how gender empowerment could be discussed in a world in which resources are so unequally distributed; how much gender equality can we find in a world that expels people from their home countries because they have become unlivable and when they are refused entry into other countries? That forces us to address the problem of the financial markets and the need to reinject resources into the real economy so that employment and production can be resumed as the main engines for societies’ welfare.
I should also like to welcome the fact — and commend the United States of America, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the permanent members of the Security Council and Germany — that an agreement was reached on nuclear issues that will help to defuse the situation and provide more certainty and security to a world shrouded in conflicts and warmongering. We were aware of those negotiations. We harboured hopes that this agreement would eventually see the light of day.
Members will wonder how we knew. Easy. In 2010 Gary Samore, at that time the White House’s top adviser on nuclear issues, visited us in Argentina. He came to visit Argentina on a mission with one goal. In 1987, under the first democratic Government and under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Argentina supplied the nuclear fuel for the reactor known as “Tehran”. Gary Samore explained to our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Héctor Timerman, that negotiations were under way on an agreement for the Islamic Republic of Iran to cease its uranium enrichment activities or to do it to a lesser extent, but that Iran claimed that it needed to enrich for the Tehran nuclear reactor and that was hindering negotiations. They came to ask us to provide nuclear fuel to the Islamic Republic of Iran. President Rouhani was not yet in office. The negotiations had begun under President Ahmadinejad.
I remember that the Minister for Foreign Affairs came to see me and submitted to me the proposal that Gary Samore had brought. He had already informed the White House envoy that his request would be very difficult to satisfy given the relationship between Argentina and the Islamic Republic of Iran because of the terrorist attack against the Argentine Israelite
Mutual Association (AMIA) that had taken place in 1994 and the decision of the judge in the case to press charges against five Iranian citizens and summon them to appear in court. Against that backdrop, it was impossible for Argentina to make a contribution to the negotiation process, which, I repeat, was already under way in 2010. I looked at the Minister in my office — I recall this clearly — and I said that if the request was made in writing and signed, we could cooperate despite all that, because we believed that the attainment of the nuclear non-proliferation objective was important.
Members know that Argentina is a member of a select club of nuclear energy-producing countries but that, nonetheless, we occupy a leading position in the field of non-proliferation. Therefore, for us nuclear non-proliferation is also a question of governmental interest. That is what I said to my Minister for Foreign Affairs, who in turn conveyed to the White House envoy that we would agree to provide the fuel, because it had been in the hands of Argentina since 1987 and we also had the necessary technology to produce it — in exchange, obviously, for such a request to be submitted in writing and signed. That message was conveyed. I believe that that was the last time that the Minister saw Mr. Samore.
Thus by 2013, when Argentina signed the memorandum of understanding with the Islamic Republic of Iran to unblock the legal matter that had brought the case to a halt years ago — and please bear in mind that the attack took place in 1994 and I am now referring to what happened in 2013 — other Governments had intervened, there had been other developments. And, because we were strongly convinced of the need to combat terrorism and of the importance of remembering, of honouring truth and justice and clarification, we were trying to find those who were guilty of that terrorist attack and to punish them.
That was the objective of the memorandum of understanding. However, it seems as if all hell broke loose with the signing of the memorandum. Time passed, and when the agreement was signed on 2 April between the 5+1 and Iran — no longer with Ahmadinejad but with Rouhani — and with the negotiations well under way, one could not but wonder why there was so much opposition and criticism against us negotiating with Iran a simple agreement of judicial cooperation for the Argentine judge to depose in Teheran the five Iranian citizens accused because of the laws that prevented the extradition of Iranian citizens. What was the reason?
I learned it here from the mouth of another President regarding hypocrisy in diplomatic relations. There is much hypocrisy blended with a lot of geopolitics and very little interest in setting the record straight when it comes to remembering and honouring the truth and justice demanded by the victims and their families.
We later sent a bill on this treaty to our Congress, which approved. I say to President Obama that I fervently hope that the United States Congress will also approve the agreement, or at least refrain from blocking it, as it will be an important contribution to global peace.
We are coherent in our approach. It is not that what applies to us does not apply to others, although we use elements or instruments that have little to do with the objectives we declare to harm the relation or the image of a country, but that is the reality of the situation.
Finally, the judge hearing the AMIA case also considered it to be a mechanism apt to shed light and to allow him to depose the accused. An appellate court was not of the same mind, and today the case has all but come to a halt. Today we can appeal only to the goodwill of the Islamic Republic of Iran, because we have no other instrument to obtain the Iranians’ depositions.
But there have been developments in my country. Under way today, on the grounds of concealment, is an action brought against the highest ranking authorities and intelligence and judicial officials taking part in the AMIA case since 1994. The proceeding is now at the oral and public trial stage.
After my order late last year to remove from office whole sectors of Argentina’s intelligence officials on the grounds of strong suspicions that they had hindered the investigation and opposed attempts to unblock the case by going and deposing the Iranians, I dismissed some high-ranking officials, some of whom had been in office since 1972 and had rendered services to all the dictatorial Governments and all the other Administrations, including my own. Some of those dismissed officials have settled here in the United States. A few days after these dismissals, the investigating prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, died.
All this amounts to something more than I have already said. I have always maintained that AMIA was a complex game of chess in international politics. Today I believe that, in addition to a chess game, it is also spiderweb of interests alien to my country. As with
all spider webs, it is only the weakest and the smallest that get caught, while the others remain outside.
In the trial for concealment being pursued now, the commencement of which was delayed almost 14 years, and also in the investigation under way into the death of Prosecutor Nisman, some details are being revealed of horrific linkages to external secret services, bank accounts abroad and relationships with vulture funds that have been denounced not by me but by individuals who are themselves members of my country’s Jewish community.
I am not here to talk with hypocrisy or lies, I am talking about what is actually happening. A few days ago we summoned the United States Ambassador in our country for an explanation of the capacity in which a particular former member of the intelligence services of Argentina was in the United States. He was in charge of the entire investigation of the AMIA case from the outset. I was just a provincial deputy in the south of the country, in Patagonia, and a delegate to the constitutional convention when the bomb exploded, and that person was already in charge of the investigation. The investigation into the death of Prosecutor Nisman is now proving his total and absolute connection with the Prosecutor, as well as that of other individuals.
On instructions from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, our Ambassador to the United States has submitted two letters to the State Department and also held meetings with the State Department to ask in what capacity that person was here in the United States. He is almost protected. I do not know from what or from whom, but he is here and protected. A few days ago, the new prosecutors in the AMIA case asked Interpol to issue a Blue Notice concerning the whereabouts of that individual.
As we have been doing since 2007, first President Kirchner and then me, every year we have been requesting the cooperation of the Islamic Republic of Iran to clarify the attack. Today we are also asking for the cooperation of the United States. Judges in our country want to know the whereabouts of this official whom everybody refers to as someone closely connected to the case, and a cover-up is even mentioned.
Members may ask themselves why I spend so much time on this issue. It is very little compared with the time that organizations paid by vulture funds have devoted in this country to criticizing, slandering and offending us as if we were accomplices of the Iranian
regime. If we are accomplices of the Iranian regime, then what is President Barack Obama? Is he not also?
Hypocrisy and double standards cannot continue in diplomacy. We cannot continue to use weapons and instruments of international intrigue — old ones — worthy of a John le Carré novel. The world is a world of communications, of the globalization of the Internet, which some dreamed would enable them to better dominate the entire world. Today the Internet is a very powerful communication tool for everyone, the entire global village where everybody knows instantly what is happening in a particular place in the world.
Our Government in Argentina will tirelessly continue to seek truth and justice in the AMIA case. We ask for the cooperation of the country whose citizens are accused, and of this country, the United States, so that it will also help to clarify the presence of this citizen, who will surely be required, as he is already being required, by the State agencies in our country.
In this world of economic crisis — and I was listening closely to some of today’s speeches — the truth is that enemies change and mutate with amazing speed. I remember the most recent G-20 meeting in which I participated — I was absent for the last one for health reasons — in St. Petersburg, where those who confronted the Government of Syria, the freedom fighters, were those who had to be supported by the entire Western world. Today the freedom fighters are part of the Islamic State of Iraq and Shams. I should like to ask members how this seemingly Islamic group actually functions. Who finances it?
When one sees these horrendous scenes where people have their throats slit and where one can clearly see three or four cameras filming the scenes, it is like a movie. It is not simply a home-made film such as a fundamentalist group could make with a simple camera. No, this is almost a full-on production. At times it seems almost like a Francis Ford Coppola movie. Four or five cameras are used, and the faces are never shown. It would be good if we asked ourselves from where is all this financed. That would help to ensure that the world can find clues to combat one of the worst scourges facing humankind today: fundamentalism of whatever nature, whether dogmatic or religious, but mainly those who consider their neighbour an enemy and a target to be eliminated.
I do not want to leave the Assembly today only with problems of debt and the economy or terrorist attacks
and international complicity. I also wish to pay homage to the continent of which I feel I am a daughter, Latin America.
Not long before I spoke, the President of Cuba, Raứl Castro, a President and a comrade whom I love and admire, spoke to the Assembly. For the first time in 17 years the President of Cuba is back here in the General Assembly. The truth is that for us Latin Americans, members of the Common Market of the South, the Union of South American Nations and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States who have struggled so much, discussed so much and argued so much so that Cuba can return to be part of these multilateral entities, we see this as a triumph of perseverance by the region, and fundamentally an achievement by Cuba.
We also recognize the Government of the United States, which has finally opened its mind and understood that things could not continue as they had done in the past. I should like to thank another Latin American who was also in this very same Hall — and who has perhaps greater authority than the rest of us because he sits on the throne of St. Peter in Rome — who played a determining role in establishing the agreement between the United States and Cuba. He came here and spoke from this platform (see A/70/PV.3) to the world and said that money cannot continue to determine politics and that there was a basic principle understood by all religions, that is, “Do not do to others what you would not like others to do to you”.
As a Latin American I also had the joy of seeing the other day in Havana the photograph of the President of Colombia, the President of Cuba and the representative of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia launching the end of a conflict that has been going on for more than 50 years and that they had tried to end with bombs and rifles. No, political, social and cultural conflicts are not resolved with bombs and rifles; they
are resolved by talking, through dialogue and the acceptance of others.
I am pleased to be part of the Latin American region, where we do not have religious or cultural clashes, where we are all children or grandchildren of immigrants and where we still receive even internal migrations. In my country the public and free national universities host students from across the continent. We do not issue a red card to anyone, for we believe it is necessary to contribute to and establish a more just world.
For that reason I say that Latin America — once perhaps the emblem of inequality — with the growth achieved by the national, popular and democratic Governments that some call populist but which have incorporated millions of our fellow citizens and which have allowed our citizens to enjoy the benefits of education, health and housing — today we say that we are a growing continent, a continent of integration.
Perhaps the contribution that Argentina has made — it was left alone in 2001 but could still reconstruct our country, and today its gross domestic product will grow by 2.7 per cent — allows us to say that inclusion, growth, development, production and trade will be reactivated only by employing the millions who have lost their jobs, improving the wages of those who get a pittance, respecting the rights of young people and children and, on the basis of synthesis, creating a fairer, more equitable and more egalitarian society."
70,2015,DEU,"The founding of the United Nations 70 years ago cast light on the dark twentieth century. That was a pivotal moment for our world. It came not against a backdrop of glorious sunshine and green pastures, but amid the ruins of the Second World War with its more than 50 million graves. As the winter of the Cold War spread its frosty fingers, the mothers and fathers of the United Nations forged the foundations of a new order — an order that is not perfect, and which may never be perfect, but which has often enough protected us from relapse into the old barbarism.
Today, 70 years on, it is clear that we are again living in turbulent times. Millions of people are gravely affected by wars and violence, and more than 60 million people have fled their homes — more than at any time since the end of the Second World War.
The foundations of the United Nations are still strong, but the world order built on them has come loose from its moorings. The old balance of power is under pressure. Powerful new players have emerged on the world stage. Most serious of all, non-State actors are now increasingly responsible for war and violence. They abide by no rules — not even the minimum standards enshrined in the international law of war.
We therefore urgently need new buttresses and pillars so that the order based on the United Nations can withstand the tempests of our times. What form could these new pillars take? How should the world order of tomorrow look?
I do not think that there is a theoretical answer to that question; the only answer is a practical one. Just as the Charter of the United Nations was adopted as a bold response to war and suffering, today new pillars will be built only if States are ready to assume responsibility and work together to find concrete answers to the crises of our times — to poverty and underdevelopment, to refugees and migration, to the devastating civil war in Syria and the failing States across the arc of crisis from Libya to Afghanistan, to religious extremism and terrorism and the murderous deeds of the people who call themselves the Islamic State.
There is, however, one major difference between now and the situation 70 years ago. The world of today
15-29658 37/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
is more closely interconnected than ever before. Borders are becoming blurred. In this age of globalization, some say, the world has become a village. If that is so, then we are all neighbours, and I would advise us to act as good neighbours. We come from very different backgrounds. We have different traditions, religions, values and world views. That diversity must be respected. No world view takes precedence over any other, but I can think of no culture in which people are unaware of what it means to be a good neighbour and in which people do not appreciate living in an atmosphere of good-neighbourliness.
Nobody is investing as much hope in that spirit of good-neighbourliness today than the millions of women, men and children who have fled their homes. My country has assumed its responsibility towards them over the past months. Since the beginning of the year, we have taken in 600,000 refugees. Currently, upwards of 10,000 new refugees are arriving every day. Those statistics show that even we cannot absorb such numbers by ourselves over the long term. We need to arrive at a European solution, together with our European neighbours, as well as with our neighbours around the Mediterranean, especially Turkey.
Secondly, the relief agencies of the United Nations system — the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs — all help people in need, on the spot and with no intermediaries. It is scandalous that those organizations are underfunded to the point that they have to cut food rations and medical aid. Accordingly, I met with the members of the Group of Seven and other partners the day before yesterday, and I am delighted to report that together we have raised an additional $1.8 billion, of which over $100 million will come from Germany, intended for the United Nations relief agencies. That will also help relieve the burden on the neighbouring countries in which the huge majority of refugees arrive, especially Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. They too need our help, so that one exodus does not trigger another.
But good-neighbourliness comprises more than just humanity and compassion. Good-neighbourliness also presupposes that we agree on joint rules that we all must obey. They include respecting each other’s borders and sovereignty. That fundamental norm is still being violated, even in Europe. The European
Union unanimously condemned Russia’s annexation of the Crimea and the actions in eastern Ukraine, and we responded, not only in terms of condemnation and isolation, but also by launching a political process to defuse the conflict. The Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) has played an indispensable role in that process from the outset. We want to further strengthen the OSCE as an institution for our common security when we Germans assume its chairmanship next year.
Active political responsibility is also part and parcel of good-neighbourliness. A neighbourhood in which nobody looks beyond their garden gate will not be worth living in for long. People must be vigilant, because there are many conflicts that can only be solved in concert and by means of multilateral diplomacy. While that may take time and perseverance, it works.
This past summer, the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany concluded an agreement with Iran. After more than 10 years of negotiations, we managed to agree that Iran will never have an atomic bomb and that we can verify this. The negotiations succeeded in bringing a number of actors to the same table, including Russia and the United States of America. The negotiations have therefore proved that while neighbours may not like one another, they can still solve problems together. Indeed they must do so, if living side by side is not to become unbearable for them both.
The agreement that was reached has created common ground on which greater security can be established in the Middle East, if we persevere in our joint efforts. However, the realities are still somewhat different. In Syria, in the fifth year of the war, the slaughter knows no end. We will only put an end to it by acting together. We have to halt the brutality of Al-Assad’s dictatorship, as evinced by its use of barrel bombs and torture. We have to break the control of the Islamic State. We have to silence the guns in Syria and provide the people who live there with access to humanitarian aid.
Moreover, we also share the commons goals of preserving the territorial integrity of Syria and restoring conditions in which all ethnic and religious groups can live in peace with each other, as well as in peace with neighbouring countries. Those are goals that all the actors must believe in, whatever differences may exist between the United States of America and Russia or between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
38/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
We already have a basis for joint action aimed at achieving those goals, as illustrated by Security Council resolution 2139 (2014). We must now implement it together with all the stakeholders as a first step towards defusing the conflict. I appeal to the stakeholders in Syria and Syria’s neighbours — but not only to them. Instead of multilateral decisions, such as those recently taken by Russia, regarding military action in Syria, we need Russia to now take political action that will advocate transition in Syria. That would be an important contribution to ending the stalemate. For that stalemate is a lethal one, which claims new lives every day.
At the risk of repeating myself, let me stress that when dealing with a humanitarian catastrophe as horrifying as the one in Syria, we are all neighbours. That is what must prompt us to crawl out of our diplomatic trenches, for there can be no military solution. Neither supposed eternal truths nor national interests must be allowed to obstruct efforts to take the first steps in defusing the conflict in Syria.
In these turbulent times, the idea of universal good- neighbourliness would be no more than a dream if there were not already an umbrella, a roof, under which universal good-neighbourliness has been practised for decades. Today we need the United Nations more than ever. We need a legitimate and responsive United Nations, and that is why Germany is campaigning for the reform of the United Nations and the Security Council. That is why we are working with others on the major global projects, on the ambitious 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals (resolution 70/1), which has just been adopted and on the equally, if not more, ambitious goals to combat climate change, which we hope to adopt together at the Conference of the Parties in Paris this December.
The United Nations provides a framework, a roof, for our global endeavours. But under that roof, the work must continue at many levels. We Germans believe, first, that the way forward lies in regional cooperation in the European Union and the OSCE and in cooperation with other regional organizations, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the African Union, among others. Secondly, we are committed to re-establishing and stabilizing State structures across the arc of crisis from Libya to Iraq and Afghanistan. And thirdly, especially in our capacity as President of the Human Rights Council, we are championing the fundamental importance of human rights. For no political order can endure if the people are not secure in their rights.
In conclusion, I would like to return to the founding of the United Nations 70 years ago. As magnificent as that moment was, it also inspires a sense of great humility in me as a German, because the Charter of the United Nations was part of humankind’s response to the war and inhumanity that had originated in my country. In the seven decades that have passed since that time, Germany has been fortunate enough to be gradually and cautiously welcomed back into the heart of the international community. For that, we Germans are grateful, but we are also aware of our responsibility. When Mr. Willy Brandt became the Federal Chancellor of Germany in 1969, he said that we Germans want to be a people of good neighbours. At the time, Germany was still divided, and those words were meant as a gesture of reconciliation towards Poland, France and the other European neighbours that had suffered greatly at German hands.
Today, when a Syrian family in Berlin tells me their tale of war and expulsion, Mr. Brandt’s words take on a new meaning. Now the world has become smaller, but the crises are no fewer. It is time for us to once again reaffirm that we Germans want to be a people of good neighbours to others near and far.
"
70,2015,BOL,"I am enormously happy to be here, on behalf of the Bolivian people, to express our feelings and to talk about our experiences and our actions to date. As everyone else has mentioned, we are here on the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The Organization was founded to seek peace after the two World Wars.
I feel it is important to make an in-depth economic, political, social, cultural and environmental assessment following 70 years of the existence of the United Nations. What has it achieved? In the eyes of the people, wars and invasions continue even after 70 years of the United Nations. What is the cause of those wars and invasions on several continents? It is due to the ambition of some regions and nations and to policies that concentrate capital in only a few hands and in only some countries, which are administered by oligarchies along with transnational companies. I therefore feel that, 70 years after its founding, the United Nations has not fulfilled its goals of peace and stability in the world.
This morning we heard various statements. Starting with President Obama (see A/70/PV.13) and then other Presidents from other continents, all of us are seeking peace. But I want to say to everyone here, representatives of all the peoples of the world, that there will be no peace without social justice. Calls were
26/34 15-29425

28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15
made against terrorism and armed insurgent groups on several continents — that they have never been able to understand their demands — while certain Powers want to understand how those problems can be solved. I also heard statements condemning social movements and confusing them with terrorist movements. I came out of social movements and the indigenous movement. Those of us from social movements are not terrorists, but rather contribute to social peace with results, as well as equality, dignity and justice.
I also want to say to those who have championed capitalism for the past 70 years that capitalism has failed. It is a failed model because, as many also said this morning, it has brought humankind only crises —humanitarian, financial, energy and food crises. The common thread of the various statements was that nearly half the inhabitants of the world are going hungry and that untold billions of dollars in economic resources are being devoted to destroying Mother Earth — or Planet Earth, as it is called in the West. Some have said that $100 billion is needed to confront and reduce global warming. Has it occurred to anyone how much money is being spent to destroy the planet, and how many countless billions are spent to invade countries?
I listened intently to the words of my brother Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, as he despaired at what the Libyan and Syrian peoples were going through. What is the cause for their suffering? Let us not forget that the United States Government overthrew Al-Qadhafi. This morning they called him a tyrant: the military intervention by the United States and NATO was to target the tyrant, the President at the time. But Mr. Al-Qadhafi was not really the target. The goal was Libya’s oil. I ask members to ask themselves to whom Lybia’s oil belongs. Does it belong to the Libyan people or the Libyan State? Or does it belong, in fact, to a few American and European transnational corporations? Imagine: they used fallacious arguments to intervene and, now that the poor Libyan people have been torn apart, they are no longer interested in them, for the economic and natural resources are now in the hands of the transnationals. That is capitalism.
I could speak about the many countries that were taken over before and since the founding of the United Nations, not to mention the situation in Syria and other countries. That is why we are convinced that capitalism is not the solution for life, and even less for humankind. That is the profound difference between us.
Some presidents at times speak in half-truths here; they do not speak the truth about what is happening in the world. While some may think that they are going to live better, such a policy is not going to resolve social problems or humanitarian issues. Living well, as our brother the President of Ecuador says, is the very synthesis of community-based socialism, while living better is the synthesis of capitalism. There is a profound difference between the two. By living well I mean living in solidarity and in complementarity — not just in solidarity with other human beings, but living in harmony with Mother Earth. For us in social movements, especially the indigenous movement, it is about Mother Earth. We are convinced that the human being will be unable to live without Mother Earth, and that Mother Earth would get along better without human beings.
There is one other thing that many may not understand, but I still want to say it. Under this way of living, basic services cannot be under private business. That comes from our significant experience. Basic services were once privatized in Bolivia — water, energy, electricity and telecommunications. Through our Constitution we decided that basic services were a human right and could never be private businesses. For we are talking about water, which is life.
Also with respect to living well, we are convinced that natural resources can never belong to foreigners or to transnational corporations. Let me comment from my own experience. After coming to power, we heard from the vigorous voices of my people and social forces in Bolivia. On 1 May 2006, in due homage to workers, we nationalized the fossil fuel industry and recovered our natural resources. During the campaign we said that there could be no masters or owners, and maybe just partners.
I shall give just one statistic in that regard. Prior to our taking office, income from oil leases stood at barely $300 million. Since the law on hydrocarbons was changed and we nationalized the industry, that income had risen to $5.6 billion by 2014. Imagine how much money was stolen from us in Bolivia under imperial domination and the neoliberal model. We went from $300 million in 2005 to $5.6 billion in 2014. For a country of 10 million inhabitants, those economic resources are exceedingly importance for economic freedom.
That is why we are convinced that natural resources should belong to the people and be under
15-29425 27/34

A/70/PV.15 28/09/2015
the administration of the State. That is our experience and that is how we have freed ourselves economically. That is why we do not believe in capitalism. Why the interventions into other countries? To take dominion over natural resources so that they can then continue to concentrate capital in the hands of a few.
Secondly, let me also say that we will face a huge responsibility in December in Paris concerning the environment. As Presidents — at least as I see it — it will be important that we take with us proposals from our peoples. After consulting my brothers and sisters in Bolivia, we will take with us policies, projects and programmes aimed at cleaning up and healing Mother Earth. If we do not take on the responsibility for saving Mother Earth, future generations will hold us responsible.
I will mention another personal experience, and I apologize for speaking even more about myself. When I travel to the countryside in Bolivia, one can no longer tell what season it is. A friend from the tropics called me at one or two in the morning one day and asked what I was doing. I said that I was in bed, and asked the same question in turn. He told me he was leaving the house to go to the river because it was too hot to sleep, and of course they still had no shower. The entire family was going to the river at that hour to protect themselves from such a high temperature. The current increase in global temperature is less than 1°C; what will happen if the temperature rises 2°C? Some experts have predicted that, if we do not stop global warming, by 2030 the temperature could rise 4°C or 5°C.
I feel that future generations will become anti-imperialists and anti-capitalists because that is the legacy of capitalism. Northern countries are now telling us that we should be the stewards of the forests for them. But we are not going to be their stewards, and they should not transfer their obligations and responsibilities to us in developing countries.
So that is another responsibility we have. We must go to Paris bearing our awareness of the responsibility to find a way to save Mother Earth. I invite participants to attend the international event of the worldwide social movement that will be held in Bolivia from 10 to 12 October, and to bring with them the proposals and ideas of their peoples. We need not be subjected to the initiatives of the American empire or of the multinationals. Now is not the time to be pursuing alien policies.
Today I heard two very interesting and very different statements: one by President Obama and the other by the President of China. What did President Obama say to us about providing security to his country and to his allies? What did he say about combating terrorism? He said that he could provide war and interference. What did the President of China offer us? Assistance and cooperation. That State is not an expansionist one.
I commend social movements. Our movements engender unity and integration for liberation, not invasion policies for the purposes of domination. We have profound differences. We welcome the words of the Chinese President, who again has offered us assistance and cooperation. We acknowledge his country’s leadership. From the media, we are also aware that the United States is in hock to China. Well, that is their problem. I hope the press is not lying. But they still threaten interference as a way to dominate the peoples of the world.
There is a debate under way. Some this morning talked about democracy. I would say that there are two types of democracy. There is the democracy of the people and there is the democracy of transnationals. The democracy of the people involves the social movements in which people organize themselves. But what does social movement democracy consist of? We do not just have representative and participatory democracy. In my experience, first as a union leader and now as President, we have always taken decisions with the leaders. There have always been differences: some sectors are more ambitious than others, and some of their demands can be both unattainable and undesirable. But the people understand. Policies are decided and programmes proposed in a joint manner. Our responsibility lies in how to meet the demands and carry out the economic and social proposals and programmes.
In the other type of democracy, which is supposedly representative, voting ends on the day of the elections. But who governs then? Let us be honest. It is not President Obama who governs, but the bankers, businessmen and transnationals who govern. What kind of democracy is that? They deceive the people into voting, and then they do not govern. I heard a candidate say in the media that he financed both Republicans and Democrats: “I command them”. That is not democracy; that is capitalism. Humankind faces serious problems. That is why we are convinced that, if we want to end poverty, we need to end the capitalist system. There is no other way.
28/34 15-29425

28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15
Moreover, I am also convinced that the new millennium should be a millennium of the peoples, not that of hierarchies or monarchies. However, I respect their rights. If monarchy is their way, we respect that. But it cannot be monarchy exported from Europe to Latin America. That must end. This is not the time for oligarchies, and much less the financial oligarchies that exist today. That is why we have an obligation to work together to combat the problems we face. While 70 years after the inception of the United Nations there may no longer be coups d’état and military takeovers, what we now have are soft coups, espionage and the stopping of presidential planes. I do not understand these times. Now there are military bases. That is why, honestly, I do not share such policies.
I do not know the degree of certainty or resolve with which they said it, but those detained for their opposition in the past have expressed the notion that ideas could not be imprisoned. We see so many terrorists, criminals and corrupt presidents who violate human rights — after killing 30, 40, 50 or 70 people — coming to the United States. If we are fighting against terrorism, crime and drug traffickers, why are those drug-traffickers, terrorists and corrupt politicians who violated human rights not thrown out of the United States and tried in their own countries? I cannot comprehend how the United States has become a graveyard for corrupt people and criminals, but that is what has happened. And some authorities and Governments wonder why they do not agree with imperialism and capitalism.
I also want to take this opportunity to address the serious issue of migration, which I did not hear other Presidents mention. Migrants are being criminalized and deported. I speak as an inhabitant of Abya Yala, our home continent called America. Europeans invaded us 500 years ago. Did my grandparents criminalize those who invaded us? But they put in place policies to exterminate indigenous peoples. They pillaged our natural resources. Yet there were never provisions or programmes in place to expel them. Some of our brothers are today leaving Latin America for Europe or the United States to work, and are finding themselves criminalized and persecuted.
Money has its tax havens under capitalism, while human beings suffer hellish poverty, and migrants are expelled. That is why we propose to work together to create universal citizenship. We all have a right to live wherever we wish in the world. Globalization should
not simply be a matter of trade and money, but it ought be for all human beings around the world. Our brother migrants should never be expelled. On its part, Bolivia never deports anyone. Our companies are now no longer the masters or the owners, now they simply provide services in our country.
The important issue of drug trafficking is another legacy of capitalism. We have nationalized the fight against drug trafficking and, in cooperation with several South American countries, have also regionalized the effort. It is very important to be aware of United Nations statistics. Drug trafficking has been guided by purely geopolitical interests. Look at the United Nations statistics. Look at those of South American countries and to those on other continents. What are the results where military bases are set up and many billions of dollars are invested? Zero. Instead, drug trafficking has increased. After having genuinely nationalized, we in Bolivia are better off without military bases, the American Drug Enforcement Administration or the economic resources that the United States should provide as part of a shared responsibility. I am not calling for such aid, but we welcome Europe’s unconditional contribution to the fight against drug trafficking. We see the results of the fight against drug trafficking.
I wish to reiterate that we countries with anti-imperialist Governments are accused of not complying with certain regulations and of being drug traffickers, while pro-imperialist and pro-capitalist countries, where drug trafficking has increased, are congratulated for their efforts. What a lie! I am not complaining, but I would simply ask members to take a look at the United Nations statistics on the fight against drug trafficking.
Fortunately, other countries have already understood the results we have achieved in Bolivia, and we are now debating the model of combating drug trafficking in Bolivia. We never said that we would attain zero coca production, but also that we cannot be free cultivation of coca. If we had more technology, such as radars, the results would be much better than at present. I inherited from the former Government more than 30,000 hectares of coca leaf plantations. This year, without the death of a single peasant, we have 24,400 hectares for traditional consumption. Look at the United Nations statistics and at those of other countries of the world.
I join the many other presidents in welcoming the agreement between Cuba and the United States of
15-29425 29/34

A/70/PV.15 28/09/2015
America to establish diplomatic relations. But I have something I would like to share with everyone, and I hope that I am not tiring members.
When I took up my functions of President, I visited the Ambassador of the United States of America, when we still had an Ambassador. He was giving me instructions: “President Evo, you cannot have diplomatic relations with Cuba, Venezuela or Iran.” Then a group of United States Congressmen came and they instructed me, “President Evo, you cannot have relations with those three countries.” Of course, I refused. I said, “If we had the economic resources, we would have Embassies in every country of the world. No one is going to tell me with whom I can and cannot have diplomatic relations.” Since then, I have never accepted the instructions of the United States authorizing or not authorizing me to have diplomatic relations with Cuba or Iran. But now I congratulate the United States of America for having diplomatic relations with Iran and Cuba, and hopefully soon they will even have relations with Venezuela.
Diplomatic relations with Cuba should not end with just an exchange of Ambassadors. Our great dream as the Bolivian people is that the United States will return Guantánamo to Cuba and that the economic blockade will be lifted once and for all. We hope that the words we heard this morning from President Obama will be followed up with action to lifte the economic blockade.
President Castro, my brother, rightly said that with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States we have declared a zone of peace. We might have a little problem in Colombia with the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) but, fortunately, thanks to the support and mediation of Cuba, we were very pleased to hear about the preliminary agreement between FARC and the Government of Colombia. We commend the efforts and patience of President Santos Calderón in reaching that agreement. But I want to say to my FARC companions that we have had 50, 60, 70 years of revolutions with arms and bullets; now a revolution is achieved through the vote, awareness and the democratic struggle. That is our experience.
Change can be made to the social and economic situation, not only here on this continent but also on other continents. When groups or social sectors are in the right and fight for the dignity and sovereignty of the people, people support that struggle, that quest to achieve liberation. We genuinely welcome that agreement.
There is another issue in our continent, that of the Malvinas Islands. With apologies to Argentina, however, the Malvinas Islands do not just belong Argentina, but to all Latin America. How can they control an island that is so many thousands of kilometres away, and so near to our continent? That has to end. We hope for understanding in putting an end to such problems that we continue to have.
We also have another pending matter, at The Hague. I welcome the presence of my Chilean brothers, who are filming me and listening attentively. One hundred and thirty-six years ago, through no fault of the Chilean people, a group of oligarchs, supported by British multinationals, invaded us for economic reasons. Just to refresh members’ memories, the invasion began on 14 February 1879. The first resistance took place on 23 March, after more than a month of invasion. I want to highlight this: after many commitments and offers from Chile, which I commend, I very much regret to say that none have been fulfilled.
That is why we turned to the International Court of Justice, because Bolivia is a peaceful country under its Constitution. We do not have an expansionist mentality that makes us want to invade neighbouring countries. That is why we are petitioning the Court. Unfortunately, certain Chilean officials — not all — say they have no pending issues with Bolivia. Recently, the Court said there was a pending issue in our continent and it deemed itself competent to resolve the case between Chile and Bolivia. It is with humility and great dignity that Bolivia welcomes that the fact that the Court has acknowledged a pending case, as this is the world’s highest judicial body, created by the United Nations.
I want to say to my Chilean brothers, and especially the Chilean people, that we do not want there to be any winners or losers. All we want is to resolve the question through dialogue and for the good of our peoples. That our great desire as Bolivians. It is not a matter of pitting anyone against each other. We are two neighbours, two brothers. How could be at odds all life-long? All we want is for what has been on offer to be fulfilled.
I welcome the support of everyone. I very well understand the great solidarity that exists on this matter, and not only on the part of former presidents, Governments, social movements and institutions. Kofi Annan, a former Secretary-General of the United Nations, gave his timely support to the case, saying “resolve the matter of access to the sea”. Not just Pope Francis, but John Paul II also expressed his support.

It is a matter of record. Four former United States Presidents and three Nobel Peace Prize laureates said that the issues of access to the sea should be resolved. This is not just a claim, but our right. Sooner or later, as a matter of justice and with the support of the entire world, we will return to the Pacific with sovereignty. We hope that it will be through an agreed dialogue, for the good of all our peoples.
I want to conclude by commending the work of the United Nations. Two weeks ago, we found out from the media that the Ambassadors and Government representatives from all over the world had adopted the principles and values of the Andean indigenous movement: do not steal, do not lie and do not be idle. Those are values from my family. I as President, as well as the Vice-President and Cabinet, apply those values. That is why we have moved ahead in such little time.
Bolivia is no longer as it was before. We came to power when Bolivia was ranked the second-to-last country of the continent, the last country in South America. Thanks to the struggle of the Bolivian people, to our social movements and to the programme now in place, Bolivia is no longer a poorly viewed, small country, as it was before. I referred to our policies briefly a few moments ago. Those three values should the standard for transparent and honest governance in the service of our peoples throughout the world. In the name of the indigenous movement of Bolivia and the Andean region, we are happy and grateful to the United Nations for having endorsed those values.
I also want to take this opportunity to commend and show my estimation for the joint efforts undertaken by Argentina, the Group of 77 and the General Assembly for adopting the Basic Principles on Sovereign Debt Restructuring Processes (resolution 69/319) and the necessary limits on the voracious transnational vulture funds. Such funds are yet another means to strangle and suppress the economies of sovereign countries, which we reject categorically. That is a way of defending the economic sovereignty of countries.
Lastly, I thank Pope Francis for everything contained in his message. My mother raised me to be Catholic. Unfortunately, because of the shortcomings of some leaders of the Catholic Church, I have been disappointed by it. Because of Pope Francis, a brother who questions capitalism and does not submit to the god of money, my morale has been uplifted, and I feel more Catholic today. And so I want to commend Pope
Francis’ message of peace. I now really do have a Pope. I know that Pope Francis, through masses and religious ceremonies, sends us his blessings and prayers. Because for the sake of life and for the sake of peace he is risking his life, we have the obligation to defend and help him. That is all I ask.
"
70,2015,STP,"It is my distinct honour and privilege to participate in the proceedings of the General Assembly on behalf of and representing the Democratic Republic of Sao Tomé and Principe.
At the outset, I would like to respectfully congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and to express our full support for him throughout his term. May it be highly successful. His election is a result of the recognition by the States Members of the United Nations of his noble humanity, vast political experience and unblemished professional history.
Before we begin to address the various topics that are of crucial importance as contributions to a better world, we must remember that this year marks
the seventieth anniversary of this Organization. That should provide Member States with the opportunity to deeply reflect on the road that has brought us this far and on the different reforms that must be introduced to make it more representative, legitimate, dynamic, efficient and inclusive and ever more responsive to the reality and challenges imposed by armed conflicts, climate changes, migrant and refugee crises, economic deregulation, endemic diseases, poverty and hunger.
Against that backdrop, we welcome the relevance of the themes of this session, which reflect the reality of our times. The post-2015 development agenda and the proper framing and resolution of climate change issues will surely create a path towards sustainable development for developing countries, particularly on the African continent.
We further wish to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the competent, selfless and zealous manner in which he has led our Organization. We also pay tribute to outgoing President Sam Kutesa, who led our General Assembly with dedication and strength during the past 12 months.
Gathered at Headquarters from 25 to 27 September, world leaders adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (see resolution 70/1). The Millennium Development Goals proved to be a good catalyst to mobilize synergies and achieve progress in social development — the reduction of poverty, hunger and disease; advances in maternal health; and access to drinking water. During that period there were major geopolitical and economic shifts. We believe that the multidimensional nature of poverty and fragility has changed. We hope that the development process in this new phase may be more inclusive, qualitative and, as the name suggests, sustainable for all, with all regions of our planet taking ownership and making commitments.
For this purpose, Africa chose, as its path towards economic and sustainable development, six pillars that are important to mention here and with which Sao Tomé and Principe identifies: structural economic transformation and inclusive growth; science, technology and innovation; people-centred development; sustainable environment, natural resources and natural disaster management; peace and security; and finances and partnerships.
We believe that in erecting those pillars Africa will take significant and necessary steps to guide the continent towards fulfilling the legitimate aspirations
40/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
of its peoples, thereby ensuring ever greater integration, prosperity and peace, under African leadership, with top priority given to the dignity and identity of our sons and daughters. That will enhance the capacity for creativity, innovation and production and will have an immediate and direct impact on the economy and sustainable human development because it will be properly sustained.
Our country, Sao Tomé and Principe, believes in the above and urges the United Nations to adapt its programmes to the specific realities of Africa, without losing sight of the continent’s accomplishments in achieving some of the eight Millennium Development Goals by some countries.
Unfortunately, we continue to see persistent hotbeds of tension and the emergence of new ones with humanitarian repercussions of alarming proportions throughout the world. In Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the efforts undertaken by regional organizations, the African Union and the United Nations have introduced some stability to the conflict zones. These efforts must continue to be coordinated and channelled in order to consolidate and reinforce the achievements.
The perennial issue of Western Sahara remains on the international stage and therefore requires greater engagement from all of us in the search for a permanent solution for that negotiation process, which has dragged on and stagnated for some time. However, to the credit of the parties, armed conflict has not resumed. We appeal to them to return to the negotiations and find a mutually acceptable political solution.
We are heartened by the recent resolution of the political situation in the Republic of Guinea- Bissau, where a serious political crisis has been overcome without recourse to violence and in strict accordance with the rule of law. That bears clear testimony to the democratic maturity that our brothers and sisters have achieved.
As terrorism continues to be a central issue in international politics, and in light of renewed acts of terrorism throughout the world, we believe the international community must act in a coordinated manner. Only then will we be able to fight this global scourge. We clearly and strongly condemn the repeated and hideous crimes that the Boko Haram group has been perpetrating in our neighbour, the sisterly nation of Nigeria.
In our opinion, nothing can justify the atrocities that Boko Haram terrorists have committed, and we take the opportunity in this privileged forum to reiterate our unequivocal condemnation of such practices, which are unacceptable in every way. We wish to express the unwavering support for and heartfelt solidarity of all Santomeans with our Nigerian brothers and sisters, and we congratulate the people and Government of Nigeria on their successes in the fight against terrorism perpetrated by Boko Haram.
Unfortunately, in the Middle East we continue to see bloody conflicts and loss of lives with the ongoing hostilities between Israel and Palestine. Therefore we appeal again for a peaceful and negotiated solution that upholds both the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the State of Israel’s right to exist, in accordance with the pertinent United Nations resolutions, with two free and sovereign States living by side in peace and cooperating fully for development.
Similarly, we cannot fail to comment on the persistence of the domestic conflict in Syria and its disastrous consequences. We again appeal to the international community to make all efforts to achieve a cessation of hostilities, thus opening the way for a frank dialogue toward a political solution to re-establish a lasting peace.
However, the prevailing situation is an opportunity for deeper reflection, in light of the migration crisis that is centred on the Mediterranean as the main access point to Europe. Indeed, the waves of people of all ages who are reaching Europe from war zones are not migrants. They are refugees. They are not evading poverty or hunger; they are literally running away from death. When a mother places a young child in a precarious boat for a difficult journey across a rough sea, with criminals at the helm, she does so because she considers that to be safer than the terra firma that she left behind. Therefore, we must seriously reflect on such episodes and the lessons they teach us regarding the signs of the new times, and draw our conclusions. We must refrain from promoting or exporting democracy in an outsider’s meddling manner or, worse still, through aggression and/or violence.
We believe that everybody will agree with us when we affirm that global security is vital to ensure sustainable development for our countries, and that it should begin at the regional and local levels. Located on the Gulf of Guinea, where we have seen a fresh outbreak of acts of maritime piracy, terrorism, drug trafficking, oil heists
15-29816 41/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
and other transnational organized crimes, São Tomé and Príncipe understands that the international community must combine its efforts to stop such acts. Therefore, allow me to mention the various existing partnerships, both bilateral and multilateral, and cooperation, among the Economic Community of Central African States, the Economic Community of West African States and the Gulf of Guinea Commission in implementing the recommendations of the Yaoundé Summit, which have made significant progress possible in the relentless fight against this type of criminal organization in our region.
With respect to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that will take place this year in Paris, São Tomé and Príncipe believes that it is imperative that we reach a global agreement on climate change, as our country is already being affected by its nefarious effects, even though we are not an active polluter. Our vulnerabilities include, for example, a reduction in rainfall and, as a consequence, diminished flows in our rivers, as well as floods and the gradual erosion of our coasts. Those warning signs are already causing concern with respect to our country’s climate problems, and we have been combating them by stopping deforestation and protecting our coastal areas.
Therefore, we welcome the determination of Germany and France to reach a climate agreement that is ambitious, broad and binding on all parties and is in accordance with the general rules of international law, with the ultimate objective of limiting the increase in the global temperature to 2°C at most, as compared to pre-industrial levels. In our opinion, that constitutes a responsibility shared among developing and developed countries. We hope that the agreement, once reached, will enhance the international obligation of all signatory parties to make funds available for ongoing scientific monitoring of climate issues and the transfer of technology to developing countries as a way of improving actions to achieve the Framework Convention’s goals.
In December 2014, São Tomé and Príncipe effusively welcomed the announcement on the re-establishment of relations between the United States of America and Cuba, and we joined the world in jubilation over the recent opening of diplomatic missions in both capitals, which thus resumed full diplomatic relations. As we did then, we express the wish that both countries continue to strengthen their relationship on the path
of economic, social and cultural progress for the benefit of their peoples and humanity in general. To that end, one issue remains pending — the trade embargo imposed against Cuba. It made no sense in the past, and it makes no sense now. For that reason, São Tomé and Príncipe appeals again for the lifting of the embargo, which would be a sign of a relationship without handicaps and would allow both countries to take fair and equitable advantage of bilateral trade relations, on an equal footing with other countries around the world.
In conclusion, we must acknowledge and welcome the political progress achieved by both sides of the Taiwan Strait, with a clear reduction of tensions, ever greater openness and broad trade exchanges. In addition, given Taiwan’s manifold potential, we recommend that Taiwan participate in the United Nations specialized agencies, as it already does in the World Health Organization.
Finally, we reiterate our country’s readiness to continue participating in efforts to mobilize wills and synergies to realize the fundamental principles and noble objectives that guided the establishment of the United Nations.
"
70,2015,SOM,"I would first like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I would also like to express our appreciation to Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the Assembly at its sixty- ninth session, for his stewardship during the past year.
It is an honour and a privilege to address this gathering today. On behalf of the people and Government of the Federal Republic of Somalia, I would like to offer our warm congratulations to the Organization on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of its foundation.
Over the past seven decades, the principled goals of the United Nations — furthering peace, protecting security and ensuring the advancement of human rights — have become unifying pillars for our global community. Somalia was one of the earliest African members of the United Nations and has remained one for more than 55 years. We have watched it grow, we have matured under its tutelage, and we have now climbed back from a difficult phase in our recent history, thankful for the support and backing of the Members of the Organization.
Twenty-five years ago, Somalia experienced its own Arab Spring, ahead of the current phenomenon that has swept through much of the Arab world in the past few years. We have seen what can happen if a society’s political demands are not adequately addressed, and we have had to learn some all too difficult lessons throughout two challenging decades. That is why it pains us greatly to see our fellow Arab and Muslim countries going down a very similar difficult road.
But it must be said that, thanks to perseverance and togetherness, Somalia has become an example of what can be accomplished in such times. We are a nation that intimately understands those famous words of American President John F. Kennedy, who said: “Mankind must put an end to war, or war will put an end to mankind” (A/PV.1013, para. 40). The theme of this year’s session — peace, security and human rights — is in line with my Government’s vision. Indeed, a new Somalia is taking shape, and we intend to continue our climb out of the dark.
I want to talk about Somalia, but a Somalia different from the one many here may have heard of. I am not here to deny our notoriety, the result of a conflict that has spanned two and half decades, but I would like to introduce another reality. Somalia is home to a proud and industrious people. Despite adversity, we have become athletes, economists, authors, poets, musicians, entrepreneurs and innovators who lead the world. Even without a Government, our businesses kept functioning. We remain a major player in the regional livestock trade and have one of the most innovative telecommunications sectors in Africa. My people are ambitious and generous. During the famine, we gave more than all the aid agencies combined.
We have built banking systems based on social capital and trust, invaluable networks that have attracted a range of investors. We are survivors, and, given the chance, we can move the socioeconomic landscape of East Africa forward. Imagine the potential in the fact that we have one of the longest shorelines in the world, hosting untapped oil and gas reserves. We are actively rebuilding our country in order to realize that potential. We must be humble. Progress is slow, but we must remember where we have come from. The civil war destroyed our infrastructure and institutions, and took away some of our brightest minds. Now, however, they are coming back, and together, we are moving forward. We have defeated piracy, we are embracing decentralization and, most importantly, we are learning lessons from our past.
The United Nations has been there with us during that remarkable journey, and we are grateful. My Government has a vision, which is to rebuild State institutions. Considerable progress has been made towards our Vision 2016 strategy. Three new interim regional States have been formed. We are consulting our people on how best to hold free, democratic elections, and we have established constitutionally mandated commissions to ensure accountability.
Allow me to elaborate on a few critical issues. First, we must ensure free and fair elections. For that to succeed, we and our constituents must agree on a fair and transparent voting system and how that system can be extended to each region. Only through inclusion will we draw public support. I should recall here that Somalia was the first country in Africa in which a democratically elected president lost an election and gracefully transferred power. That history must define our future.
We must also prioritize our national security forces. There is still an active insurgency that we are risking our lives to dismantle, for our own safety and for the security of our region. Last year, together with African Union forces, we liberated all our major regions from Al-Shabaab. But our soldiers are underpaid, underfed and underequipped and yet are expected to put their lives on the line for their country. That is unacceptable. We must invest in professionalizing our security and police forces. Peacekeeping missions work best when they have clear objectives and timelines, both for restoring stability and for building the capacity of national security forces.
I would like to ask everyone here to join me in paying tribute to all those who have helped liberate us from violence, many of whom have made the ultimate sacrifice. Our women — mothers, daughters and sisters — also deserve limitless praise for enduring the worst of our brutal conflict. The survival instincts of the Somali people are most evident in its women. They raise families while their homes are being bombed, walk miles without water in search of safety, and bury their children while continuing to work to feed the rest of their families. We know what war can do. And that is why I, as a father and a husband, will ensure that we will defeat terrorism. It is our duty as a Government.
Another issue of great importance is the problem of Somali refugees and undocumented migrants still living in temporary camps, some for more than two and a half decades. We are grateful to the countries in the region that have helped and hosted our people, but we recognize that many of the refugees continue to live in perpetual crisis, without any hope of resettlement, residency or citizenship. That is unacceptable. We urge our friends here in the Assembly to work with us to find a durable solution. The transition will not be easy, but millions of lives depend on it.
Ultimately, we must enable the rebuilding of State institutions and infrastructure. Effective and transparent institutions are a prerequisite for providing services. Somalia lacks completely, or has in very short supply, the public services that many people around the world take for granted. For the past two and half decades, public services, including schools, water and power, have been run by private companies. It is critical that all Somalis feel they have a stake and a role in the Government. The country’s residents have the right to demand services of us. If we fail to provide them, we risk falling short of their expectations.
As I stand here today, I am proposing a grand development plan for Somalia. It will focus on rebuilding our social and physical infrastructure — roads, schools, hospitals, community centres, ports, airports and markets, all of which are essential if we are to revive the State and the economy. The plan, which is aligned to the new Sustainable Development Goals, will help to minimize duplication of effort and empower Somalis to keep building their own future.
The bulk of our population is under the age of 30. They are the future of our nation. It is from them that we are borrowing today’s resources and to them that peace will pay its ultimate dividend. We must find a place for them in leadership, and we must create jobs and opportunities for them. They need the kind of opportunities and challenges that drive all young people around the world to try to succeed. We need to provide incentives for them, so that they have a choice and can leave extremism behind. That grand development plan for Somalia, akin to a Somali Marshall Plan, can create countless opportunities for our young people to invest in their own future.
Billions in taxpayers’ money has been pumped into Somalia, and we have had some successes, but not enough. Non-governmental organizations have become a local business; some are effective, others are not. We need a different approach now. We do not want charity; we want direct investment. We need to build quality schools and fill them with quality educators. We need to pave roads, build markets and rejuvenate agricultural production so as to make us East Africa’s largest exporter of quality produce once again. Our New Deal is a useful aid framework, but we must translate it into results. And it is about time. Somalia’s development plan will ensure accountability and transparency for every investment made. Every United Nations Member State will have the opportunity to help Somalia evolve into an economic powerhouse and a future trading partner, and we will share the plan with all in due course.
We are grateful to the Members of the United Nations for supporting us over the past two and half decades, for welcoming our people as their own, for turning a relatively small nomadic tribe from the Horn of Africa into a global workforce and for the time and resources that have been invested. We are humbled by their generosity. We will make their efforts work for our people, but we also need their continued support.
Only four years ago, radical insurgents controlled our country, oppressing our people and threatening their lives. But today, children are returning to the beaches of Mogadishu and other cities along the Indian Ocean; women sit on dunes selling home-baked bananas, and the sound of bullets has been replaced by the noise of construction. Look how far we have come, and imagine what we can do in another four years. We are looking forward not only to bouncing back for our own benefit, but also to becoming a shining example to nations that are in the throes of hardship, that are working hard to move from the third world to first, and that are finding it hard to navigate the difficult but worthwhile road to recovery. We are ready to play our part so that we can give back, contribute to their success and their fulfilment of their rightful destiny, and take our place among the contributing nations of our global village.
Somalia has failed my generation, but I will dedicate my life to ensuring that it does not fail the next. Yet I cannot do it alone. Only together can we become the Somalia that the world is waiting for.
"
70,2015,DOM,"It is an honour to participate once again in the work of the General Assembly as a representative of the people and the Government of the Dominican Republic. At the outset, I would like to welcome and congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session.
This anniversary gives us the opportunity to put in perspective what the Organization has meant for humankind. It was established 70 years ago as the fruit of the worst horrors of war and as the first global forum created to preserve peace, coexistence and the well- being of all human beings. It is true that the United Nations was born of the wounds, pain and fear left by the great conflicts of the twentieth century, but it also arose from the unstoppable force of hope and the iron will of great men and women who believed in dialogue, solidarity and the grandeur of the human race.
Although we still have far to go and although immense challenges remain, the Organization continues to represent the values that inspire us day

after day. Over the past 12 months, the international community has experienced difficult challenges, but it has also witnessed encouraging events that we would do well to recall. We witnessed the reopening of embassies between the United States and Cuba, which brings us closer to the day when that sad, decades-long conflict will finally come to rest in the history books. We are also putting the final touches on a renewed commitment to global development, which is enshrined in the post-2015 development agenda in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). At the same time, the industrialized nations have finally taken a decisive and resolute step forward to combat climate change. We welcome their political will, for which we have been calling for some time, because we believe it represents an act of responsibility and justice that heralds a more equitable model for the distribution of responsibilities between rich and poor nations.
The post-2015 development Agenda provides an excellent opportunity for us to focus on our most central priority and the greatest enemy of sustainable development, namely, inequality. The fight against inequality is the point of departure for solving the majority of the global challenges, yet it remains our main unfinished task throughout the world, especially in Latin America. If we review our achievements, we see a landscape filled with light and shadow, one that offers grounds for rejoicing but also one that prompts urgent calls to action. On the one hand, Latin America, after Asia, is the region with the largest middle class, with more than 130 million people projected to attain that status by 2030, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
However, along with sub-Saharan Africa, it is also the most unequal region in the world. Even today, the wealthiest 10 per cent of Latin Americans receive 32 per cent of the region’s income, while the poorest 40 per cent receive only 15 per cent. So, despite our efforts to combat poverty, it remains excessive and is aggravated by great inequality. As the excellent 2014 study by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), entitled “Instability and inequality”, points out, greater equality with growth requires two profound changes — first, in our structure of production, and secondly, in our structure of distribution. In other words, growth is as necessary for equality as equality is for growth. To put it even more clearly, we need both a responsible productive sector that
guarantees wealth creation across all layers of society and an active, effective State to ensure the redistribution of wealth and the creation of opportunities.
However, if we look at the current structure of the productive mechanisms of the countries of Latin America, we have to acknowledge the differences within that structure. In other words, we need to recognize that at least three levels of development exist simultaneously in each country. On our journey towards progress, we not only ride in different cars and in different classes, but on different rails, which means that we move forward at radically different speeds. According to a recent study of 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that was conducted by ECLAC and the German Agency for International Cooperation, our region operates a high-speed rail system, as it were, which connects modern global businesses to international trade and accounts for 60 per cent of gross domestic product but only 20 per cent of jobs; a medium-speed rail, which prevails in the middle income countries, accounting for 22.5 per cent of gross domestic product and 30 per cent of jobs; and finally, a rail that serves micro-businesses and the informal economy, which together bring in only 10.5 per cent of wealth but account for 50 per cent of jobs. That makes it impossible for everyone to benefit and participate proportionally in growth.
As the ECLAC study makes clear, what we have is a structural factory for inequality, which means that major changes will be needed to correct our path and enable everyone to advance at the same rate. We need to change the structure of production, shatter the old ways and move ahead together to a model that will benefit everyone, big and small. To begin with, it is essential that the “middle way” be promoted in particular. Public policies must help to ensure that small and medium- sized enterprises have better access to credit and are more competitive, productive and innovative. Small and medium-sized enterprises must also become actors in globalization, finding their proper place in the production chains. In that way they will be able to provide not just more jobs, but proper jobs, high-quality jobs, and they will be able to hire an increasingly well- trained labour force.
Along with the necessary changes in the structure of our economies, the State should be the second pillar of the fight against inequality. We have to reassert the role of the State as an effective redistributor of wealth, as a creator of opportunities and as a defender of the rights of all citizens.

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17
Let us remember the counterexample of what happened in the 1980s, during the so-called lost decade. Poverty increased to cover almost half of the Latin American population. The austerity policy that many States opted for further aggravated the situation and slowed the recovery. In the next decade, the 1990s, the recovery began, and there was major progress in key areas, such as education. That yielded fruit in 2002, when a labour force that was better educated than their parents was finally able to finally benefit from an expanding economy and higher wages.
Since then, the Gini index on income inequality has dropped by 5 per cent. That shows clearly that social policies are essential, along with changes in productivity and improvements in the labour market. We cannot continue looking at the relationship between economic policies and social policies as an unresolvable conflict. Rather, we have to tackle both aspects at the same time and move in the same direction to reduce inequality. Only in that way can we deal with problems that seem to be endemic, but that actually derive in large measure from the disproportionate allocation of available resources.
Look at what has been happening to our youth. Today, this generation of young people has received more years of schooling than anybody else in our history. And yet, they have higher rates of unemployment and only part-time work. Another paradox is that, although they have more years of schooling, only one third of poor students, according to tests, meet the minimum reading competency levels. In parallel, the increasing automation of work means that soon, instead of choosing between skilled and unskilled jobs, it will be a question of skilled jobs or simply unemployment. Therefore, if we do not want that scenario to continue perpetuating exclusion, we have no other option than to make a firm commitment to quality education. And we have to do that in a serious way. The Dominican Republic is trying to improve the quality of its educational system, and we are also trying to achieve the necessary changes to make our economy grow in equality, so that our State can be active in supporting its people.
Inequality is the root cause of many of the challenges that we face globally, including violence and insecurity, which particularly afflict Latin America and the Caribbean. Ours is the only region where the homicide rate has increased over the past 15 years. There is a lot of discussion about the relationship between violence and inequality. Recent studies show that a 1 per cent
increase in the Gini index leads to a similar rise in the homicide rate. And though it may sound harsh to describe that terrible tragedy in economic terms, we cannot fail to note that the impact of violence on people and goods costs us 14.2 per cent of the gross domestic product in the Latin American region. At the same time, inequality is also a breeding ground for transnational crime and drug trafficking, which are recruiting young people at an increasingly early age and robbing them of future opportunities.
Therefore, one of the tasks facing us at the international level is to rethink our policies on how to combat drugs. As members of the Assembly know, next year the special session on the world drug problem will take place, at the request of Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia. We hope that, by the time that session is held, the idea that drugs constitute a problem that affects only some countries will have been dismissed for good. The tens of thousands of people killed in the so-called war on drug trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean cannot be regarded as collateral damage. It is a humanitarian disaster that is due too often to policies that have been badly designed and/or are poorly implemented. We need to change our focus and reach a new, more updated and realistic international consensus that leaves room for national Governments to design policies suited to their circumstances, as some countries represented here are already doing.
In conclusion, may I return to the more optimistic note on which I began. The international community, represented here in the General Assembly, has made historic progress. Although we know that much remains to be done, the balance of what has been achieved in terms of the Millennium Development Goals shows that we can move ahead when we focus our efforts properly. Our experience in the Dominican Republic shows that having a clear agenda and a common course is the only way to move forward rapidly. We have therefore prepared our post-2015 development agenda, which leads us to propose a major partnership between the private sector, civil society and Government so that the change can be lasting and sustainable. We believe that when the political will exists, no challenge is too great. I have no doubt that we can find the will to overcome the challenges before us.
The post-2015 agenda provides the opportunity to focus our efforts on the roots of the problems. The time is now. The responsibility is ours. From now on, let us work to create countries with equal opportunities

for and access to development for all our citizens. We are working for equality and solidarity and for a fair distribution of the resources of this planet that we share.
"
70,2015,BEL,"A predecessor of the President of the General Assembly at its first session, in 1946, was one of my compatriots, Mr. Paul-Henri Spaak. In the midst of the Second World War, he said that we must take advantage of the exceptional circumstances to seize the opportunity to make substantial progress in the world and to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. That was the objective of the founders of the United Nations 70 years ago.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrines fundamental human rights and universal values. All human beings are born free and equal. Freedom of thought, freedom of opinion and freedom of expression are intangible. Those freedoms are the foundation of a democratic world in which each individual’s dignity, no matter what his country, origin or culture, must be fully respected.
Since 1945, the world has changed and much progress has been realized. I am 40 years old. The challenges our generation faces are multiple, complex and increasingly interrelated — conflicts, poverty, climate and migration. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) should give new impetus and greater force to our joint action for development. As I said, I am 40 and was born well after the independence of the African States. My belief is that the destiny of Europe and Africa are inextricably linked. Everyone stands to gain from the success of others, but we can also lose much from failures. I have not known the period of colonization. I know only an Africa of free and independent African States, so I have no sense of nostalgia nor guilt. But I do have a feeling of responsibility. We must look clearly and optimistically to the future of the continent, to which my country is especially committed. We want a sincere and frank
relationship of equals, a partnership in which everyone is fully respected and no one teaches the other lessons.
With its more than 1 billion people, I am convinced that Africa will have an increasingly more important place in the world. We know the potential of the continent. Africa has the talent and Africa has the resources. I think first of the young Africans, who are full of vitality and ingenious and who want to take their destiny into their own hands. They have a feeling of dignity and freedom that nothing and nobody can stop.
The primary condition for development is respect for the rule of law and the guarantee of personal freedom. The years 2015 and 2016 are election years in Africa. There can be no democracy without legitimacy, and there can be no legitimacy without respect for the constitutional agreements that unite the leaders with their peoples. Certain countries, such as Nigeria and Senegal, have demonstrated wisdom. But we can only condemn the coup d’état attempts, such as that which recently occurred in Burkina Faso. Ultimately, we must call on all Heads of State to fully respect the electoral cycles as set out by their Constitutions.
The Charter of the United Nations enshrines the sovereignty of all States. Sovereignty first of all entails the primary responsibility of leading a country in the public interest. In no case can sovereignty it serve as a pretext for an oligarchy. Sovereignty involves duty to the people. Ignoring the people’s will or trampling on their freedoms will succeed only for a short period of time, because the people’s thirst for freedom and dignity will sooner or later win.
In Burundi, we spared no effort to ensure respect for the Constitution and the Arusha agreements. The obstinacy to remain in power at whatever cost is a certain form of blindness that upsets the balance.
Today, unfortunately, the country is deeply divided, and it is Burundian citizens, many of them now refugees, who are the main victims. We would like to once again make an urgent appeal for a political dialogue between the Government and the opposition under the auspices of the countries of the region, within the framework of the East African Community.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a great country situated in the heart of Africa. It has a young, dynamic population and abundant natural resources, but also a history of tragic conflict for which its population has paid a terrible price for many years.

Respect for the rule of law and constitutional order is the only road to stability. With elections in the offing, everyone is expecting the country’s political officials to demonstrate that they have the best interests of their country and people at heart.
My country is also committed to working to improve both security and development in the Sahel region. Destabilization in Libya, explosive population growth and climate change have all resulted in serious problems, as we know. We want to continue to support peacekeeping operations in the Niger and Mali, as well as the efforts of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali.
Along with official development assistance, we should encourage private initiative. Economic development must create jobs and produce more revenue for States. Improving the business climate and combating corruption will promote investment. We should also encourage innovative financing for development, such as, for example, the idea of an international tax on financial transactions.
We are all dealing increasingly with the rise of terrorism, and my country has not been spared. Terrorists want to destroy our universal values, and they do it by striking down innocent victims indiscriminately. While we must mobilize all possible means against these new threats, it is the duty of democracies to fight fanatics with respect for the rule of law. It will not be easy, but we must keep a constant watch over the balance between the right to security and respect for individual liberties. We must mobilize our security forces, police and judicial authorities, but we should also, perhaps, rely more on local communities, religious and spiritual leaders and civil society. Since 2003, negotiations on an international convention on terrorism have been at a standstill. In that regard, I would like to urge that we put renewed effort into making that international convention on terrorism a reality as soon as possible, and in that way add to the means for taking action at our disposal.
Other speakers before me have also urged that we must work to resolve the conflicts in Libya, Iraq and Syria. To be clear, in Syria it is not a question for us of choosing between the fanatical barbarism of the Islamic State, on the one hand, or the tyranny and massacres of Bashar Al-Assad, on the other. We believe we must act in parallel, at once eradicating Daesh and at the same time forcing a political transition
towards free and credible elections. Syria needs strong institutions and a legitimate Government. That is the only possible path to peace and stability. We advocate a comprehensive humanitarian and political approach, with the possibility of considering a military option conducted with respect for international law. We support the extraordinary commitment of Mr. Staffan de Mistura, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, to re-starting a dialogue between all the parties.
It has to be said frankly that the situation in Libya is the result of a failure on the part of the international community, and it shows clearly that only a comprehensive approach makes sense. At present, extremist groups of all stripes are sowing terror, as the attacks attempting to undermine the democratic transition in Tunisia attest. Here, too, we fully support the United Nations efforts to promote a political dialogue.
We see that conflict and war push populations to seek safety elsewhere, far from home. Today, 60 million people around the world are displaced and often risk their lives to flee conflict. Syria, sadly, is only one of the tragic examples of such situations. We should support the countries that have to deal most directly with the consequences of those conflicts — Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey — and I welcome the fact that the European Union has decided to mobilize €1 billion to support hosting refugees in those three countries.
In the Middle East, the peace process is stalled. We believe the status quo is not an option. Raising the Palestinian flag here at the United Nations, as we hope to do, is of course a symbol, but it is not enough. More than ever, in our view, the objective should be recognition of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State, with full respect for Israel’s security. We have to tell it like it is — neither rockets nor illegal settlements can pave the way to that vital goal. Europe must work harder with all its partners, and it is in that spirit that Belgium supports France’s initiative to establish a contact group bringing together countries of goodwill.
The Charter of the United Nations establishes the principle of sovereign equality. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of every country must be guaranteed absolutely. In that regard, we stand by Ukraine in upholding the principles and obligations of international law. The Minsk agreements must be fully implemented by all the parties.

I would like to conclude by pointing out that while of course peace and security will always continue to be our goals, and differences between countries will continue to exist, it is the duty of humankind and of the General Assembly to resolve emerging conflicts through dialogue and mutual understanding, rather than guns and fanaticism. The peace agreement in Colombia, the Iranian nuclear agreement and the resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba show that dialogue and respect can produce concrete results. The international order must assume that everyone, regardless of origin, culture or religion, fully endorses our basic universal values. As President Obama put it so well only days ago in this very Hall, “You can jail your opponents, but you cannot imprison ideas” (A/70/PV.13, p. 11).
As a Head of Government, I know the responsibility that lies on the shoulders of those who represent their people. And, like all those here, I know that everywhere in the world there are pitfalls, contradictions and tragedies. But, above all, the world is made up of women and men with dreams and hopes both for themselves and for those they love. The spirit of freedom, innovation, intelligence, ingenuity, respect and tolerance are the best weapons we have to overcome the challenges of this century together. I would like to end with the words of Paul-Henri Spaak, the first President of the General Assembly, who said during his presidency that between a perfect world and a better world, he chose the better world. We know that a perfect world is unattainable. But a better world depends only us. A better world demands courage, responsibility and solidarity. With that conviction, I wish to affirm here my country’s commitment to a better world.
"
70,2015,GHA,"Let me congratulate the Secretary-General, the staff of the United Nations and, indeed, all Member States, on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of this all-important international Organization.
“Study history, study history”, Winston Churchill, the famous British Prime Minister once said, for “in history lies all the secrets of statecraft”. And so we study history. In millions of schools throughout the world, there are untold numbers of students studying history and learning about the events of our past. And in the pages of the books they use to study, history is compressed and reduced to its barest essentials. The immensity of a whole era is whittled down and conveyed in mere paragraphs, with significant events carefully packaged into simple sentences. Nevertheless, within those pages are indeed the secrets of statecraft. From those pages, we come to understand what our world once was and the process by which it evolved to become what the world is today. Reading them, we learn from the mistakes that were made.
The world, into which the United Nations was born 70 years ago, seems like such a faraway reality. In 1945, the names that filled newspapers were those of Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Dresden and even that of the Red Army. In 1945, Ecuador declared war on Germany and Japan. Syria
also declared war on Germany and Japan. The Soviet Union was victorious in the Battle of Konigsberg, as well as the Vienna Offensive. Spain broke off diplomatic relations with Japan. And the historically neutral country of Switzerland closed its borders with Germany. Those are just a few of the events that took place before the watershed San Francisco Conference in April of that year, when 50 nations convened to declare their commitment to peace.
My country, Ghana, was not among those nations. It would take another 22 years for the then Gold Coast colony to gain its independence and become Ghana. In fact, a great many of the countries represented here in this Hall — particularly those from the so-called developing world — did not exist as sovereign nations. Nevertheless, here we are today, very much a part of this Organization, aptly called the United Nations, and very much a part of this world. That is why I wish to state, quite emphatically, at the start of my address, that it is time for there to be greater inclusivity at the United Nations. Truth be told, it is long past time. The world that was in 1945 does not exist now in 2015. Therefore, the visionary Organization that was formed to meet the needs of that world must now be reformed to meet the needs of today’s world. And those needs are many.
The names that fill today’s newspapers are those of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Boko Haram and Al-Qaida. The hashtags that circulate on the social media now refer to Sandra Bland, who died under suspicious circumstances while in police custody in Texas; Aylan Kurdi, a young Syrian boy who, along with his family, washed up on the shores of a beach in Turkey; and Madau Gach Dut, one of the thousands who have died in the conflict in South Sudan. I could continue, because the names are many and the lists are long.
Thousands have died in Syria, Pakistan, Nigeria, Mexico, Afghanistan and Somalia, and thousands more, the majority of whom are from African nations, have died in the Mediterranean Sea, while attempting to flee poverty, hunger, disease, political strife or persecution. Then, too, there are those who did not die while seeking refuge and whose perilous journeys brought them safely to the borders of other nations While some of those nations welcomed their arrival, others subjected them to further alienation and degradation.
The numbers are staggering. That is not the history that is being taught in schools — at least, not yet. Those
18/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
are not events that lend themselves to being written down in a book and condensed into nicely worded paragraphs and sentences. Those are not events that once happened a long time ago. Those are events that are happening today. They are events that are happening in our time. And as we gather here today to discuss the road ahead, I wish to quote a few words from the speech that Franklin Roosevelt, before his untimely death, had been writing and preparing to deliver at that fateful San Francisco Conference. Mr. Roosevelt wrote, “The work, my friends, is peace”.
Despite all the changes that have occurred in the world over the course of the last 70 years, that singular truth remains the same. But peace, as so many great men and women have reminded us, is not just the absence of war. Peace is also the presence of dignity in one’s life, the achievement of equality in one’s endeavours and the respect of one’s humanity and its attendant rights. If we are to discuss the road ahead, we must do so with new language, with ideas and solutions that do not exist in the annals of history. And we must begin with an examination of our most basic institutions — governmental, cultural, societal and personal.
Some of the institutions that were set in place to protect and promote peace are the very ones violating their mandates and engendering fear in the public. When one race of citizens feels as though their lives do not matter, when refugees successfully escape the horrors of war only to be further brutalized on foreign soil, when the already-traumatized victims of conflict are violated by international peacekeepers who were sent there to ensure their safety and well-being, then we, as leaders and as the world community, must stop being silent and start taking action. We must create change, because fear serves as fuel for disillusionment and apathy, for hatred and xenophobia, all of which form the seed that, if allowed to take root, will ultimately grow and bear the rotten fruit of war.
What we learned 70 years ago, with the formation of the United Nations, is that we must each be our brother’s keeper; we must allow ourselves, as people and, even more, as nations, to belong to one another. In Ghana we are also reviewing our rules of engagement to maintain a balance between the maintenance of law and order and the basic rights of our people to free speech and free expression.
Since the beginning of time, cultural and societal traditions have been used as markers of identity. Kente cloth is as defining to Ghana as kimonos are to Japan, as quinceañeras are to Latin America, and as bar mitzvahs are to Judaism. Yet some practices and beliefs, although considered traditional, have no place in our world today, and they should not be permitted a place in the world that we are planning for the future. Among those traditions are those that deny individuals, particularly women and children, their basic rights and force them into situations that relegate them to a life vulnerable to poverty, disease and other unbearable hardships.
Most of the world’s poorest people are women. Currently, we create programmes and policies to address that imbalance; yet, regardless how successful they may be, they are not permanent solutions. They do not solve the ultimate problem, that is, the vast inequality between men and women that so many traditions have inculcated over the years.
In Ghana, through the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty programme, we have provided cash grants to a total of 77,000 households throughout the nation. That programme, which is aimed at poverty alleviation, also entitles its recipients to the provision of free health care through the national health insurance scheme. In order to address the issue of child mortality and malnutrition, preparatory work is under way to earmark disbursements for pregnant women and mothers of children under the age of one year.
It is not a secret that when it comes to gender equality, education is the key to change. Gender inequality is a problem that must be addressed at its root. We speak often of ability and access, and those are honourable concepts, but the actuality is that being able to get an education and having access to an education is not the same as actually getting an education.
In Ghana, we have made tremendous progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target on universal basic education. We have instituted the Girl Child Programme, which encourages parents to send girls to school, and at the primary level we have achieved gender parity between boys and girls. But what happens beyond the primary level is another matter altogether. Young girls are often taken out of school and married off. Africa has the highest rates of child marriage in the world, following only Asia. It was the intention of the 1964 United Nations Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage
15-29562 19/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
and Registration of Marriages to abolish the practice of child marriage. Yet in West Africa, two out of five girls will be married before the age of 18. Those young girls will face increased maternal mortality rates and increased rates of sexually transmitted diseases; they are subject to the sort of poverty that is nearly insurmountable. However, research shows that 64 per cent fewer girls will become child brides if allowed to complete secondary school.
Recognizing the significant difference that that change could make in our nation, Ghana has launched a campaign, under the auspices of UNICEF, to end child marriage in our country by focusing not only on young girls’ access to school, but also on their completing their education. That is being achieved through enhanced access to secondary education and beyond, without compromising quality.
Thus far this year we have had a fruitful General Assembly. We adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (resolution 70/1), we have discussed how to establish resilient health systems, and we have held a summit on peacekeeping and strategies to deal with religious extremism. We will take many memories back with us, but one remarkable image that made a huge impression on me in the early days of this gathering was the Pope’s car. It was breathtaking to watch the pontiff as he greeted massive crowds and moved even Government officials to tears in an open gallery; but nothing was more breathtaking than watching him entering and being driven through the streets of New York in a tiny Fiat 500. It was a great metaphor for the times in which we are living, and a powerful lesson about some of the changes we must make to confront our rapidly changing future.
I felt a strange sense of solidarity with that small vehicle as I watched it cruise down the streets of New York, dwarfed by the humongous sport-utility vehicles surrounding it. It reminded me of the plight of the so- called developing nations in our relationships with the wealthier, larger, more established nations of the world. There is a sense of being protected, yet also of being overpowered; of being guided, yet intimidated to stay the course they are navigating. However, more than any of that, what struck me was the modernity of the moment. The survival of our planet depends on us coming to terms with such modernity. It requires us to redefine our relationship with nature and to realize that we are just one part of a larger ecosystem. We must
finally realize that we are dependent upon nature, and not the other way around.
In recent years, signs of transformation in Africa have generated great hope and very high expectations. Many African nations have embraced democracy, and free and fair elections have become a regular occurrence on the continent’s calendar. Several African nations are seeing accelerated economic growth, and a more than modest amount of success is being achieved in reducing hunger and poverty on the continent.
My own country, Ghana, has benefited greatly in working to achieve the MDG targets. Ghana is considered one of the bright lights of Africa, that place that was once derisively referred to as the dark continent. Our nation boasts a strong, stable democracy, with an economy that has been growing positively for more than two decades. While we are exposed to the current uncertainty in the international markets, strong cooperation with our multilateral and bilateral partners has led to positive movement towards fiscal consolidation. Moreover, our current agenda for transformation is aimed at diversifying our economy and accelerating growth. My Government is committed to maintaining strict fiscal discipline in order to stabilize the macroeconomy and stimulate growth and business activity.
All of that notwithstanding, one of the major constraints facing all of Africa is a shortage of electric power, and there Ghana is no exception. In many African nations, power outages resulting from shortfalls in power generation are even considered normal. In Ghana, two decades of consistent, positive growth has resulted in the demand for power outstripping supply. The resulting load management programme has, unfortunately, slowed growth, while taking a steep toll on economic and social life. Small and medium-sized enterprises, which can least afford the high cost of purchasing and operating generators to back up their power supply, are being severely affected by that. We are pursuing a programme to introduce emergency generation so as to balance demand and supply. Looking forward, we plan to put an additional 3,500 megawatts of power into our transmission grid, utilizing the significant gas reserves that we have discovered in our offshore concessions. That will be supplemented by renewable power, mainly from solar, biomass and wind sources.
The road ahead, not only for so-called developing nations like Ghana but for all nations, demands that we
20/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
achieve energy sufficiency in a sustainable manner that does not further worsen the fragile environment of our planet. In December, representatives from around the world will meet in Paris to discuss issues of climate change, the effects of which have become undeniable. The changes to our planet as a result of global warming are apparent for all to see: the receding glaciers in temperate climates, the reduction in rainfall and the advancing deserts in Africa, and the lakes that are virtually disappearing in the Middle East and Asia. All those things should serve as a wake-up call for us to take drastic and immediate action to save our planet and save humankind. We must curb our consumerism, not just out of respect for the environment but also in the exercise of tolerance and the mindful practice of coexistence.
Recently, the United States and Cuba have taken significant measures to normalize relations between their two countries. That is an important first step towards discarding the relics of the Cold War represented by the economic blockade of Cuba. I am also encouraged by the historic agreement between the United States and partners, on the one hand, and Iran, on the other, to curtail the development of nuclear weapons in that country and encourage the peaceful use of nuclear technology. That gives me hope that, with dedication and focus, we can also resolve the seeming intractable issue of Palestine. Ghana supports a two- State solution to that conflict, with a peaceful and stable Israel in coexistence with a sovereign Palestinian State. To that end, we call for the immediate cessation of settlement construction in the Palestinian territories.
Seventy years from now, I wonder what those looking back at this era will think of it. I wonder what they will think of us. When those millions and millions of girls and boys study our era and the events that are now shaping our world and lives, what will our actions or inactions say to them? What secrets of statecraft will they learn? And most important, what sort of world will the work that we are doing here today — the work of peace — produce for them to inherit? It is, after all, their history that we are holding right now in our hands. We cannot fail them.
"
70,2015,DMA,"Several weeks ago, as we prepared to address this historic seventieth session of the General Assembly on the post-2015 development agenda and in the general debate, we pondered issues of significance to our country, our region, small island developing States (SIDS) and our planet. We decided then, as we have done in the past, that we must highlight the challenges brought about by the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the resulting changes in global climate. That is a major threat to our planet, with a disproportionate impact on SIDS.
Our concerns have been magnified since 27 August, when Tropical Storm Erika brought with it up to 18 inches of rain in 16 hours in Dominica, with a concentration of heavy continuous rainfall over a five-hour period. The intensity of the rainfall led to rapid flash flooding and numerous landslides in several communities. Dominica was severely impacted, with 13 people confirmed dead and 17 still missing, while roads, bridges, houses, public buildings and the main airport were devastated. Two communities in the south of Dominica had to be evacuated, displacing hundreds of families.
According to an initial assessment conducted by the World Bank, the Government of Dominica and other partners, Tropical Storm Erika caused losses and damage to infrastructure in the amount of up to 1.3 billion East Caribbean dollars, or $483 million. In
less than 24 hours, 90 per cent of Dominica’s gross domestic product was wiped out, and over 7,000 people were severely affected. Most of the damage was sustained in the transport, housing and agriculture sectors.
Owing to the magnitude of the damage and the limited resources of our country, we had to depend on support from outside Dominica to provide immediate relief to those who were affected. The outpouring of support allowed us to bring emergency relief to all people in a timely manner. On behalf of the people and Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica, and on my own behalf, I wish to extend our profound gratitude to all the countries, governmental and non-governmental organizations and Dominicans, at home and abroad, for their tremendous support during our time of need.
We also thank those partners that have pledged their commitment to working with us during the rebuilding of a stronger and more climate-resilient Dominica. My Government and people will forever be grateful to those who extended the hand of friendship to us. With the help of God, the international community and the resolve and resilience of the Government and people of the Commonwealth of Dominica, we will build a stronger and more resilient Dominica. In building a better and stronger Dominica, we will, of necessity, have to factor into our constructions and settlements measures that will provide resilience and adaptation to the impact of climate change.
We therefore expect that replacing and restoring damaged infrastructure will be more expensive than it has been in the past. That extra cost undermines our progress in achieving sustainable development, because of the constant need to re-allocate resources from nationally identified priority areas to address the challenges — challenges brought about, to a large extent, by climate change. Those are factors that contribute to the high debt burden of small island developing States such as Dominica.
At times like these, in order to respond effectively to the disaster, we urgently need the assistance of the international community, to make available, in a timely manner, access to grants, concessionary financing and development assistance. That is of critical importance to ensure that the gains we have made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals are not reversed and that we are able to meet the agreed Sustainable
10/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
Development Goals (SDGs). Beyond the immediate present, the Commonwealth of Dominica calls for an international natural-disaster-risk fund to provide financial resources to small island developing States that have been impacted by natural disasters. In the case of the Caribbean States, that could be in collaboration with or an extension to the catastrophic risk fund that exists in the Caribbean Development Bank. We propose that that special natural-disaster-risk fund should be capitalized by the annex I parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, other major greenhouse-gas emitters and voluntary contributions by other countries.
Over the past decade, the impact of climate change has wreaked havoc on Caribbean SIDS. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan, a category 3 system, wiped out twice the value of the gross domestic product of Grenada — approximately $1 billion — and left 18,000 people without shelter, food and personal belongings. On 24 December 2013, we were violently reminded of the impact of slow-moving weather systems on the lives of our Caribbean people. Dominica, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines were set back by 3.4 per cent, 1.4 per cent and 12.8 per cent of their gross domestic products, respectively.
We in the Caribbean have been on the receiving end of the impact of climate change for decades. We therefore know from our own experiences that the impact of climate change represents a real and present danger to the existence of small island States like Dominica. We are living the effects of climate change. Even as recently as yesterday, our sister Caribbean island country of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas was impacted by Hurricane Joaquin. We stand in solidarity with the Government and people of the Bahamas, as they struggle to deal with the devastation that it has caused.
As we move closer to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) later this year, we trust that all States parties are heeding the warnings of the scientific community and the plea of those of us who experience the impact of climate change on a daily basis, and that they are preparing to make serious commitments to reducing global warming. It will be crucial at COP21 to put in place a system that makes possible the achievement of the not-more-than 1.5°C goal, by agreeing to the highest possible levels of mitigation, ambition, finance and a
very rigorous system for transparency, complemented by a compliance regime.
However, while such commitments are commendable and should reduce and hopefully reverse the trend of increasing global mean temperature, the slow onset of events of climate change will continue to have severe impacts on developing countries. We therefore call for the establishment at COP21 of a new loss and damage mechanism that will take into account the impact of climate change and provide resources for SIDS to respond to those challenges.
The recently concluded Summit on the post-2015 development agenda laid out a highly robust and people-centred framework that we must all commit to implementing for the sake of a better tomorrow for our citizens and future generations. We must participate and play our individual and collective roles in ensuring that all 17 of the Agenda’s Sustainable Development Goals and its 169 targets are not merely aspirational but also achievable. We were gratified to see several of our priority issues reflected in the text, such as a need to build resilience and to conserve and sustainably use oceans and seas; food security; water and sanitation; affordable, reliable and sustainable energy; crime; climate change; and sustainable consumption and production, among others.
It is up to all of us, individually and collectively, to ensure the realization of the SDGs. The Commonwealth of Dominica is therefore encouraged by the strides that small island developing States are making towards the attainment of SDG 7, on affordable and clean energy. Just a few days ago, on 27 September, SIDS demonstrated their leadership, by creating the first-ever intergovernmental organization for SIDS, the Small Island Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative (SIDS DOCK). The statute came into force with a membership of 32, creating a sustainable energy and climate-resilient organization. SIDS DOCK is intended to provided a collective voice, financial leverage and implementation mechanisms to transform our national energy sectors into catalysts for sustainable low-carbon economic development and help us meet the urgent need to mitigate, adapt and build resilience to climate change. The Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica is proud to have had the opportunity to serve as the Chair of the steering committee responsible for the establishment of this first-ever intergovernmental organization of SIDS.
15-29946 11/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
On behalf of the States members of SIDS DOCK, we wish to express our gratitude to our partners, Denmark and Japan, which have made our initiative possible. We also extend our thanks to the Government of Austria and the United Nations Development Programme for being genuine partners in the spirit of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway and establishing the earliest centres for renewable energy and energy efficiency in the Caribbean and Pacific. We also thank the Government of Sweden for its support for the development of the project pipeline. We look forward to their continued partnership in that and other initiatives aimed at achieving the SDGs.
SIDS are equally concerned about sustainably utilizing and conserving local resources, such as our oceans, seas and marine resources, for the benefit of all our people. SDG 14 creates an opportunity for SIDS to have more control over the vast marine area, which when combined is six times larger than the land mass of the European Union. For small island States — or, more appropriately, large ocean States — we are the oceans. We therefore endorse the We Are the Ocean initiative being developed and co-chaired by the Marshall Islands and Grenada, with the Commonwealth of Dominica playing a major coordinating role. As a response to that need, a few days ago, at the annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, SIDS DOCK, together with partners, launched the Blue Guardians. We look forward to participating in that initiative.
The Commonwealth of Dominica is encouraged by the emphasis that the Addis Ababa Action Agenda has placed on the mobilization of support for the post- 2015 development agenda. A combination of financing modalities and sources is essential to assist developing countries meet their development goals by providing access to essential public services, ending hunger, reducing poverty and enhancing the lives of all people. Dominica is therefore committed to and supports the call for us to incorporate sustainable development and the pursuit of equity, including gender equality, women and girls’ empowerment, and social inclusion, in our domestic policies. Those policies are consistent with the goals my Government has been committed to and has been promoting since the dawn of the century.
Our efforts notwithstanding, middle-income SIDS like Dominica are a special category that must be recognized and dealt with in a manner that reflects our realities. The measure of per capita income as a qualifier for determining access to official
development assistance and concessionary financing distorts the true situation of SIDS and ignores our special vulnerabilities. The public debt stock is another essential indicator that must be factored in when the true state of middle-income SIDS is considered. High debt overhang makes it difficult for SIDS to provide essential public services. That is compounded by the fragility of our economies and the constant threat and impact of natural disasters, which make us especially vulnerable. In fact, according to a recent report by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, it is estimated that the economic cost of natural disasters in Caribbean countries over the 2000- 2014 period exceeded $30.7 billion.
Furthermore, I am advised that at least 40 per cent of the debt burden of Caribbean States is due to debt incurred in responding to natural disasters. A single major natural disaster can set back one of our small islands for more than a decade by obliterating the country’s gross domestic product overnight. The recent cases of Grenada and Dominica illustrate that point vividly. In order for financing for sustainable development to be effective, durable and genuine, there must be partnerships based on mutual respect. Development partners, especially intergovernmental agencies and financial institutions, must be more responsive to the needs of SIDS. Interventions therefore must reflect the aspirations of the people and be informed by genuine participation and local ownership.
The traditional North-South relationship must be reset to embrace collaboration and cooperation rather than prescription and dictation. The new approach should be enhanced by South-South and triangular cooperation. We therefore encourage countries in the South that have the means to do so to support South- South and triangular cooperation, to build essential public infrastructure, to provide financing and to participate in science and technology innovation and capacity-building.
The People’s Republic of China, for example, has emerged as a leader in South-South cooperation. The South has been benefiting from China’s role in economic and social development through bilateral cooperation. We commend the efforts by the People’s Republic of China for its role in establishing the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, thereby creating a multilateral platform for South-South cooperation as an extension to its excellent bilateral cooperation. Our cooperation with the People’s Republic of China has
12/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
brought about major improvements in our country’s infrastructure, education, health care, sports, national security and agriculture. We thank China for its contribution to the people of Dominica.
South-South cooperation in some cases has created economic space for our countries to implement infrastructure and social programmes for the benefit of our people. A case in point is the PetroCaribe arrangement by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in which Latin American and Caribbean countries are provided with a reliable supply of oil and oil products under favourable terms and conditions. That spirit of solidarity is a shining example of South-South cooperation. The leadership of Venezuela has also led to the creation of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA). ALBA has funded and continues to fund development programmes in agriculture, infrastructure, education and health care in Dominica and its other member States, especially in the Caribbean.
Similarly, the Republic of Cuba has been a leader in South-South and triangular cooperation. Cuba has provided tremendous support to countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region and as far away as Africa, thanks to its vast pool of human resources, especially in health care and education. At the same time, Cuba has provided capacity-building and technology transfer in essential areas.
We applaud the actions taken by President Barack Obama to normalize relations between Cuba and the United States. The removal of Cuba from the United States list of countries that sponsor terrorism is an endorsement of the call that Dominica, the Caribbean Community and the majority of the States Members of the United Nations have been making for almost two decades. Those steps are undoubtedly steps in the right direction, that is, towards the full integration of Cuba into the international, economic, financial and trading systems. We appeal to the legislative branch of the United States Government to allow President Obama to complete the process by lifting all sanctions on Cuba.
Almost 70 years ago, on 24 October 1945, the United Nations came into existence when 29 nations ratified the Charter of the United Nations. The impact of two major wars in short succession had devastated the world, leaving millions dead. The world vowed “never again”. The world of today is far different than it was 70 years ago. There are far more Member States and the
balance of power has shifted slightly, with the South playing a greater role. Human development has been unprecedented, moving more people out of poverty, and yet so much more needs to be done. We have placed our planet in peril from the existential threat of climate change. The rise of terrorism and radicalization throughout the world, especially in Iraq and Syria, is an attack on peace and security everywhere.
We therefore must resolve to enhance the role of the United Nations in resolving matters that go beyond borders and affect all of humankind and our planet. That requires changes to the working methods of the General Assembly and a more representative Security Council to reflect today’s realities. We must continue to call for the protection of our planet. We must listen to and heed the cries of those who are suffering throughout the world. We must create and adopt policies that address the pressing needs of the most vulnerable among us. Above all else, we must continue to work to resolve the issues that threaten the peace and stability of our nations.
"
70,2015,TUN,"It is my honour, as I begin my statement, to convey to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, and through him to his country, Denmark, our sincere congratulations on his appointment to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I should also like to express our thanks to Mr. Sam Kutesa for his able leadership of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.
At this time, I should also like to thank Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon and assure him of the constant support of Tunisia in carrying out his noble duty.
In the past few years, Tunisia has seen very important events occurring in the framework of its democratic transitional process. There is now greater political and national awareness among politicians and components of civil society, which has allowed us to adopt dialogue as the only means to seek solutions to our crises and differences of opinion, and to avoid violence, individualism and exclusion. Thanks to this consensus- based approach, Tunisia has been able to adopt a new Constitution that manifests the fundamental values of democracy, human rights and the peaceful handover of power. Similarly, and in the framework of the transition process, we succeeded in organizing legislative and presidential elections. Observers, both inside and outside the country, bore witness to the integrity, transparency and independence of the elections, which allowed us to establish robust, permanent democratic institutions.
As the success of any political process is contingent upon efforts made on the economic and social fronts, the Tunisian Government, guided by its awareness of the need to tackle current challenges — in particular countering unemployment, strengthening national development investment and ensuring social justice — decided to draw up a strategic vision for
15-29595 11/23

A/70/PV.18 29/09/2015
the country for 2016-2020 that will determine the guidelines and courses set nationally regarding sustainable development. In this regard, Tunisia reaffirms its responsibility for improving growth and development and acting in line with the aspirations of its people. We therefore urge our partners and friends in the international community to support national efforts in particular in the area of youth employment, strengthening investment and support for local and national development.
Regional changes have been swift and ongoing. We have seen them lead over the past few years to an exacerbation of the terrorist threat that now jeopardizes the stability and security of many States of the region, including mine. While our country has made significant progress in the area of security and counter- terrorism — particularly through the defeat of many terrorist plans and other criminal activities and the arrest of many suspects who were then prosecuted — over the course of this past year, we have nonetheless been the victims of two heinous terrorist attacks targeting the Bardo Museum and a tourist site in the city of Sousse in a cowardly attempt to undermine our social approach of centrism, moderation and tolerance, and to frustrate the economy by targeting its vital tourist sector. While we express our great sadness regarding the country’s losses from these two crimes, we affirm that the perpetrators of these crimes will not enjoy impunity. No one can resort to terrorism to further his own objectives or to destroy Tunisian society.
Our plan for counter-terrorism is based on a comprehensive and integrated approach that goes beyond the necessity for military and security responses and seeks to understand the political, social, cultural and economic reasons behind terrorism. Nationally speaking, the prevalence of terrorism and extremism across the globe is now a significant incentive for finding a new way to combat terrorism, in accordance with bilateral and multilateral cooperation frameworks. While we welcome all initiatives to coordinate international efforts to combat terrorism, we reiterate our offer, made from this rostrum, to convene an international high-level counter-terrorism conference in Tunisia aimed at coordinating international efforts.
The alarming increase in conflicts and tensions throughout the world, whatever the reason, is of great concern to us. It requires the international community to scale up its efforts to find ways to halt these conflicts peacefully, particularly by prioritizing dialogue and
mediation efforts and strengthening activities for peacebuilding.
For Tunisia, the Palestinian cause remains at the core of important issues and conflicts in the region. We therefore reiterate our full support to the brotherly Palestinian people as it seeks to recuperate its legitimate rights to self-determination and the establishment of its independent State. Tunisia supports efforts for the continuance of peace negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis on the basis of a timeline for ending the occupation, and for the adoption of a United Nations resolution that would put an end to the Israeli occupation and restore to the Palestinian people their legitimate rights. We also condemn the ongoing Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip and its settlement policy, which is in violation of international law and international legitimacy. They represent an attempt to impose a new status quo and to undermine the two-State solution as well as efforts to continue talks on the basis of a solution that would guarantee security and stability for all countries of the region.
Near Tunisia, the brotherly Libyan people are seeing the fallout from a crisis that threatens its stability and security and goes beyond the borders of the Libyan State to jeopardize the stability of the entire region, and Tunisia in particular. We firmly believe that dialogue remains the sole solution to overcoming Libya’s internal differences and to ensuring national reconciliation and respect for the will of the Libyan people for a political solution and a rejection of violence.
I reaffirm Tunisia’s appeal to the brotherly country of Libya and our support for efforts to find a political solution under United Nations auspices and establish a Government of national reconciliation and accord. The international community’s support is very important in that respect. The threats and dangers posed to neighbouring countries by the spread of the terrorist organization Daesh from Libya are growing. That requires strengthened coordination and cooperation among neighbouring States. We also need support from the international community in our efforts to suppress the threats to neighbouring countries.
In addition to the crises in our region, four and a half years have passed as the Syrian crisis continues to deteriorate. That is a reflection of the gravity of the political and humanitarian crisis in which our Syrian brothers have suffered death, displacement and other travails. The situation calls for credible action on the part of the international community to coordinate and
12/23 15-29595

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18
mobilize efforts to take immediate measures to halt the violence, disorder and chaos and to protect life. Tunisia urges all influential stakeholders in the Syrian conflict to step up their efforts to find a consensus- based political solution to the crisis based on dialogue and peace. We welcome the international efforts to breathe new life and hope into the situation and to find a consensus-based political solution that will spare Syria the threat of fragmentation and division.
In the face of the suffering of the brotherly country of Yemen and the humanitarian disaster that threatens to tear apart Yemeni society, national cohesion and Government, we express our full support for all efforts to put an end to the bloodshed and war and to assist the country to move beyond this crisis and alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people. We call on all factions in Yemen to return to the negotiating table and to prioritize dialogue and reason in the established framework for the country’s political transition.
Not far from that brotherly Arab country, we are seeing an exacerbation of the situation in Iraq, where terrorism is increasingly prevalent and entrenched, and ethnic and sectarian genocide is being perpetrated. This requires a firmer resolve than ever on the part of all regional and international stakeholders to re-establish security, stability and accountability for the gruesome crimes that have undermined the material, human and humanitarian assets in that country.
The sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly saw the evolution of many political, development and security milestones. We saw a galvanization of international efforts to ensure that all means were made available for success based on the growing awareness regarding the need to enhance justice in international relations and to put an end to disparities in development, while guaranteeing sustainable development for all in all social, economic and environmental dimensions. Among these milestones we note the holding of the United Nations Summit on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and the adoption of important resolutions to reduce poverty, promote social development and actively reduce the gaps between the countries of the North and the South by improving the levels of development in all its dimensions, in particular in developing and least developed countries.
Along these lines, the third Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July saw the adoption
of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, reflecting the concerns of developing and least developed countries regarding technology transfer, capacity-building, development assistance and others, and complementing international efforts in this arena. Tunisia actively contributed to the success of these events by actively participating in the preparatory process in our capacity as a member of the intergovernmental Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, and in the geographical group relevant to this issue.
In the framework of similar efforts to support the work of the international community in sustainable development, we assisted in the preparation of the twenty-first session of the Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is to take place in Paris in December. We have finished preparing our nationally determined contribution, which reflects the country’s efforts in the areas of adaptability and future programmes. We welcome the relative successes of the United Nations in these areas. Nonetheless, we continue to believe that there is a need to continue to work together to better guarantee the efficiency of the Organization’s efforts to address important contemporary issues for humankind, in particular by broadening the decision-making circle and encouraging balance in international relations by enshrining the principle of partnership.
The choice of the topic “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights” as the theme for this session of the General Assembly is relevant to us all at a time for taking stock of the progress that has been made in various areas. Each and every one of us here today is responsible for correcting imbalances and changing the future or destiny of peoples to ensure more justice, equality and fair sustainable development. We are all accountable for redressing these imbalances and ensuring that greater justice, equality and equitably distributed sustainable development prevail in future. That also holds true for any confrontations and for establishing channels of communication in the framework of mutual respect. We shall spare no effort to achieve these noble goals.
In conclusion, allow me also to convey my hope that the United Nations will be capable of tackling the major challenges before us today so that, thanks to the shared desire of Member States, we can achieve peace, development and security. I am convinced that the common ground that brings us together is much more significant than the differences that divide us.
"
70,2015,MNE,"This year we proudly mark a noteworthy anniversary — 70 years since the founding of the United Nations, and seven decades dedicated to freedom and peace, fundamental human rights, equality between great and small nations and social progress. That dedication has unquestionably demonstrated the value of the United Nations, and future generations must share in that same mission, aimed at achieving a better humankind.
At the outset, I would like to stress that Montenegro is strongly committed to preserving all the values the United Nations was founded on. Freedom and peace, fundamental human rights and social progress are values that all States Members of the United Nations should be committed to for the sake of their societies and the Organization. We therefore believe firmly in working to ensure the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).
15-29658 11/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
As a member of the Human Rights Council, and through its cooperation both within the Council’s mechanisms and special procedures and with States and other stakeholders, Montenegro has made a strong contribution to enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Human Rights Council and its mechanism, the Universal Periodic Review, while respecting the principles of universality, impartiality, non-selectivity and constructive international dialogue and cooperation. In our actions at both the national and international levels we have paid particular attention to, among other things, the issues of preventing discrimination and violence, protecting the rights of children, persons with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, empowering women and girls and protecting freedom of opinion and expression. The fact that this year is the twentieth since the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action should push us to intensify our efforts to implement those important documents in the area of enabling and empowering women and girls to exercise all their human rights.
Montenegro strongly supported the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and is committed to its comprehensive implementation in order to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development in all its dimensions. Financing is crucial to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals that the Agenda sets out. For that, our main guidelines are outlined in the final document (resolution 69/313, annex) of the Addis Ababa Third International Conference on Financing for Development. Mobilizing all the available resources and including the Agenda in national development plans are prerequisites for its successful implementation at the global level.
We believe firmly that national sustainable development strategies, backed by integrated national financial frameworks, must be supported by an enabling international economic environment. It is crucial to ensure that all national stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, participate in their adoption and in monitoring their implementation. Bearing in mind that implementing the development Agenda is an obligation we have to future generations, I am pleased to be able to point out that in addition to institutional capacity-building, Montenegro has begun the process of drafting a new national post-2015 strategy for sustainable development, whereby the Sustainable Development Goals established at the global level
will be adapted to our national context with a view to achieving sustainable development within Montenegro.
Action designed to deal with climate change should be an integral part of all development policies and programmes. We believe the recent successful high- level meetings in Addis Ababa and New York will encourage countries to intensify their efforts to achieve a universal and legally binding agreement on climate change in Paris at the end of the year.
We must work together to end conflicts and rebuild peace. To that end, it is vital that the international community, acting in accordance with the norms of international law, work to put an end to the violence in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Libya and other areas in crisis. The serious human rights violations and intensifying violence and crimes committed by terrorist and extremist groups, such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and Boko Haram, are clear evidence of the seriousness of the threat that terrorism poses to international peace and security. Global engagement is therefore the only way to guarantee protection against it.
We support global efforts to achieve disarmament and non-proliferation. We are pleased about the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty and we urge that its provisions be effectively implemented. We welcome the positive outcome of the negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme and the ongoing dialogue between members of the Security Council and Iran with a view to ensuring that it meets its international obligations and that a comprehensive and durable solution to the issue is achieved.
The current challenges and threats to global peace and security require a preventive approach to violations of international law. We support the report of the High- level Independent Panel on Peace Operations on the future activities of peacekeeping missions (A/70/95), as well as the report of the Advisory Group of Experts on the review of the peacebuilding architecture of the United Nations (A/69/968). We believe that their recommendations will help to improve the existing architecture and its effectiveness. The inclusion of a gender perspective in all areas of the peace and security agenda, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), is of special importance, in particular in the context of the upcoming review of the resolution’s implementation 15 years after its adoption.
12/55 15-29658

Montenegro is firmly committed to actively contributing to and supporting collective efforts to maintain international peace and security. The deployment of Montenegrin soldiers and police officers in international missions testifies to our readiness to fulfil our international obligations and to develop relations based on partnership.
Montenegro remains strongly committed to the concept of the responsibility to protect, with particular emphasis on the importance of preventing mass atrocities at the national and regional levels, including through the early-warning mechanism and an early and balanced response in cases where the risk of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide exists. We will continue to demand accountability and punishment for all perpetrators.
In conflict resolution, the use of preventive diplomacy, in particular mediation, is necessary. In this regard, strengthening the capacity of the United Nations so that it will be able to respond to the growing needs in this field is imperative. Given that our region is one of fragile stability, we have learnt from experience that dialogue and cooperation are the best ways of defusing tensions, overcoming differences and achieving durable solutions. Therefore, Montenegro will, in 2016, organize a meeting under the Mediation in the Mediterranean initiative, as a sign of our commitment to the further promotion of mediation as an effective means for the prevention and management of conflicts and peacebuilding.
Ensuring the protection of civilians in conflict areas and meeting their basic humanitarian needs are essential. We are committed to supporting the strengthening of the United Nations humanitarian assistance architecture, which plays a decisive role in coordinating international humanitarian assistance. To that end, the organization of the upcoming World Humanitarian Summit, to be held in May 2016, is important, as it will be an opportunity to consider the challenges that the humanitarian sector is facing today.
In addressing the current migrant crisis, we must be guided by the shared United Nations values of humanity and solidarity, and we must take into account migrants’ need for assistance. This implies eliminating the causes of migration and considering the real abilities of each State to receive migrants and offer related assistance. As a country where refugees recently accounted for one fifth of the population, Montenegro understands the
need for solidarity with people in great trouble and the heaviness of the burden of a receiving country.
The interrelated challenges the world faces illustrate the need to reform the Organization in order to properly position it in the system of global governance. Guided by this, Montenegro will continue to support efforts to strengthen the United Nations and improve the efficiency, transparency, accountability and representativeness of the Organization and its agencies. We also confirm our commitment to build an effective multilateral system in which the United Nations plays a central role. We support the agenda of a coordinated approach — delivering as one — and are undertaking activities aimed at adopting the second integrated programme of cooperation between the United Nations system in Montenegro and the Government of Montenegro for the period 2017-2021.
Finally, I would like to reiterate that Montenegro has been fully committed to the implementation of United Nations values and programmes. As a country in the last stage of the NATO integration process and in the successful negotiation process for European Union membership, Montenegro has been a good neighbour and reliable partner in the West Balkan region, where the values of cooperation and stability have been increasingly affirmed. We are confident that in these ways, inter alia, we are also contributing to the achievement of United Nations goals.
"
70,2015,CRI,"Costa Rica would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I reiterate my country’s commitment to work with you, as we do with all Member States, to achieve the goals that we have set for this session and to strengthen global governance and multilateralism. You have demonstrated excellent judgement in focusing this debate on the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the Organization, especially the interrelationship between peace, security and human rights.
The intensity and gravity of events leading up to this session make our discussion both timely and urgent. Millions of human beings are living through a black, starless night. Their pain, their despair and their anguish are testing us to the core of our humanity. Caught in the perilous grip of circumstances from which no one can escape, let us demonstrate that a new era is dawning for our civilization and that we are not witnessing its decline.
Costa Rica urges, therefore, that we in the General Assembly, instead of going in for the same rhetorical exercise we engage in every year and every decade, repeating what we already know, take action and translate into deeds what until now have been merely words. What we say and what we do must be consistent. We are not prisoners of fate, but rather, the shapers of destiny. Our actions matter.
This must be the time for the General Assembly to trigger long-awaited processes, to shake off indifference and to embrace solidarity with renewed passion and commitment. This must be the time for the General Assembly to show that, while we are a community of nations, we are also much more than the sum of our individual interests. This must be the time for the General Assembly to consolidate the leadership of the United Nations as the centre of global governance and to continue to engage in reforms that will make it more effective, efficient, robust, proactive and dynamic.
To that end, let us begin by electing in the most democratic way possible the person who will hold the position of Secretary-General. Since 1946, the selection process for the person to hold the most important position in the international community has been characterized by its lack of transparency. Costa Rica is determined to change that. Along with Estonia, my country is leading the efforts of nearly 30 States to establish a process that is transparent, democratic, equitable, inclusive and that, unlike its predecessor, will be consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and similar high-level international processes.
Costa Rica is proud to have included, in resolution 69/321, adopted just a few weeks ago, an invitation to Member States to suggest female candidates for the position of Secretary-General. The time has come for that position to be held by a woman. Let us acknowledge the ability, competence and commitment
15-29562 13/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
of women in all spheres, and let us send an unequivocal political signal that, as we commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Organization is practising what it preaches in terms of equality and the empowerment of women and girls.
In order to consolidate the position of the United Nations at the centre of global governance, the Security Council should assume its responsibilities in its response to the maintenance of international peace and security, taking into account human rights in its actions and improving its work in the prevention of conflicts. The Council’s focus on conflict prevention is inadequate, and when it does take action, that action often comes too late. That has been true in the case of Libya, Mali, the Central African Republic, Somalia, the Sudan, South Sudan and Yemen. I say that because of the acts of sexual violence and gender-based violence that have been perpetrated against girls and boys, women and men in Iraq, Syria and north-eastern Nigeria. I would also refer to the genocides in Rwanda and Srebrenica and to the tolerance that has been shown for violations constantly committed against many peoples, including the people of Palestine, and against racial, ethnic or sexual minorities in other parts of the world, including in the West. I also say that because of the millions of Syrians who have been displaced in historic proportions, and the thousands more who continue to risk their lives at sea to escape death inflicted by chemical weapons, barrel bombs and cluster munitions, weapons whose use Costa Rica categorically condemns.
None of those crises erupted without prior warning. They developed over years, and sometimes decades, of offences against human dignity and human rights. They were caused by deficient or corrupt Governments and institutions, which engaged in acts of repression, discrimination and exclusion, acts that eventually restricted fundamental freedoms; deprived people of their economic, social and cultural rights; exacerbated disparities in development; and failed to uphold the right of the peoples of the world, including the right of the people of Israel, to live within secure borders.
The primary responsibility for promoting, protecting and fulfilling peoples’ rights and fundamental freedoms rests with the States. However, when Governments fail to meet their responsibility to protect, because they lack either the will or the ability to safeguard the rights of their own people, then it is up to the international community, and in particular the Security Council, to
intervene and to deploy the wide range of resources and tools at its disposal to resolve conflict. Despite those resources, we did not do enough to prevent the current human tragedy. We did not do what was necessary to prevent thousands from venturing out to sea with their children.
If the United Nations is to consolidate its position as the centre of global governance, it must ensure that respect for and the promotion of human rights are not subject to manipulation. We must be particularly wary of the attempts by some States to manipulate the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations in an effort to prevent the United Nations from tackling the global challenges for which it was set up and from effectively defending the rights of individuals. Some try to distort the purposes and principles of the Charter by affirming, for example, that human rights violations are not related in any way to the maintenance of international peace and security, or that sovereignty precludes the commitment of this Organization to such issues.
Sovereignty, a concept associated with the birth of the nation State, should no longer be used as an excuse for the international community to sit back and be a silent witness to a bloody theatre of war. The less we consider sovereignty as a wall or a shield, the more likely it is that we shall be able to fulfil our responsibility to protect the civilian population. In the words of the Secretary-General,
“Early action to prevent conflict and protect human rights helps to strengthen sovereignty, rather than challenge or restrict it” (S/PV.7389, p. 3).
Thus, no single country — none — can hide behind the wall of sovereignty and silence when serious violations of human rights are perpetrated. No crime against humanity should go unpunished. For its part, Costa Rica reaffirms its support for the Secretary- General’s “Rights Up Front” initiative, which places human rights issues at the heart of efforts by the United Nations. It is an attempt to correct the systemic failures of the past, as the initiative recognizes that the violations of those rights indeed constitute early warning signs of coming crises.
Because human lives are at stake, Costa Rica supports the French proposal to restrict the veto in cases of mass atrocities. That proposal dates back to our membership in the Small Five Group and also to efforts spearheaded by Liechtenstein in the Accountability,
14/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
Coherence and Transparency group. The latter Group has made efforts to adopt a code of conduct that would require the permanent members of the Security Council to refrain from using the veto in situations of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity and to be politically committed to acting promptly and decisively in such situations.
The opinion of a single permanent member cannot continue to bear more weight than the necessity to save lives. When a permanent member uses, or threatens to use, the veto, in those circumstances, it publicly abandons and disregards the right of victims to justice and peace and undermines international efforts to put an end to impunity. The veto breaches the trust that millions of people have vested in the United Nations as their last hope in such cases as those mentioned. We all agree on the importance of strengthening the rule of law to consolidate the institutions that protect the civilian population to address the root causes of conflicts, to promote accountability and to combat impunity, both nationally and internationally.
It is no coincidence, then, that the rule of law has a key place in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). However, only one permanent member of the Security Council acknowledges the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, and only two have ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Costa Rica calls upon all States to adhere to and implement international instruments for the protection of human rights and the fight against impunity in the face of atrocious crimes. Once again, we call on all States to ratify the Rome Statute, including the 2010 Kampala amendments. The more multipolar our world, the stronger will be our confidence in the rule of international law throughout the world.
The commitment to maintaining international peace and security is also reaffirmed by all permanent members of the Security Council. However, at the same time, they are the largest producers and exporters of conventional weapons in the world. Moreover, despite the explicit prohibitions in the Arms Trade Treaty, those countries continue to conduct international arms transfers, including transfers of small and light weapons, and including to conflict areas in the world. The explicit prohibitions on transfers of conventional arms contained in the treaty exist to prevent human suffering and to save lives. They are not there to be ignored. Costa Rica calls on the States that have signed
the Arms Trade Treaty to ratify it, and on those who have ratified it, to set to work without delay, enthusiastically, energetically and with dedication, on securing its full and effective implementation.
Furthermore, States possessing nuclear weapons, including the permanent members of the Security Council, have violated their unequivocal commitment to nuclear disarmament pursuant to article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. They argue that the current security climate is not conducive to nuclear disarmament, and they cling to the traditional paradigm of State security that keeps 16,000 nuclear warheads in the world, many on high- alert status and even susceptible to cyberattacks.
Compliance with article VI is not conditional or optional; it is mandatory. Nuclear disarmament cannot be postponed any longer. The fact that 115 States have signed the humanitarian pledge for the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons demonstrates that the international community is convinced of the need to place nuclear weapons on an equal footing with other weapons of mass destruction, weapons that are prohibited under specific treaties. Costa Rica calls for more States to endorse the humanitarian pledge and to fill the legal vacuum by prohibiting and eliminating the nuclear threat once and for all.
Placing the United Nations at the centre of global governance is not limited exclusively to improving the work of the Security Council or strengthening its role in conflict prevention. It also implies a greater strengthening of the General Assembly and the Organization as a whole. Thus our efforts must go further. Let us focus not only our attention, but also additional resources, on building up the third pillar, that of human rights.
In terms of human rights, the United Nations has fostered a significant policy development, even extending border protection to cover an increasing number of vulnerable groups, such as children, people with disabilities, the elderly, migrants and indigenous peoples. But while the principles and obligations are clear, and an institutional structure of deliberative and executive bodies exists, the situation on the ground in many parts of the world is far from what it should be, and the distribution of resources does not match the statements and declarations.
The promotion and defence of human rights cannot continue to be limited to rhetoric. In a year that marks
15-29562 15/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, gender equality and the empowerment of women in many regions of the world must cease to be mere words and become commitments aligned with and following from the Declaration, incorporating public policies at the national level that bring us genuinely closer to the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with a cross-cutting focus on gender that is realized in every Goal, target and indicator we have committed to.
The major challenges facing multilateralism therefore require a more effective and efficient governance structure if we are to achieve respect for human rights and their observance and progressive development. It is crucial to create opportunities for effective participation by non-State actors and to enhance regional structures for implementing the global agenda, but above all, it is essential to make increased budgetary provision for strengthening institutional frameworks, given that at the moment the third pillar of the United Nations receives only 3 per cent of its regular institutional budget.
We should adjust our regulatory framework and institutional efforts in the area of human rights so that the Human Rights Council, the system of human rights treaties and the Security Council, among others, can better synchronize their efforts. The challenge is to ensure that we act as a single Organization, effectively and coherently, not clumsily, not fragmented, so that we can protect and promote people’s rights, including the right to development. We showed that we could do that throughout the negotiating process that led to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in which Costa Rica shared its experience on the issues of conservation, environmental protection, unilateral disarmament and leadership in creating a model for sustainable development. And we will show it again in Paris at the end of this year when we reach a landmark agreement on climate change, because climate change constitutes such a serious threat to human development.
Costa Rica firmly believes that, where Paris is concerned, we need serious, binding, people-centred commitments that respect our rights and involve comprehensive action on climate issues not only on the part of Governments but also from the various economic and social sectors. In that regard, I would like to especially commend the leadership of President François Hollande and the support that President Barack
Obama has given to the process through his clean energy plan. We must also take advantage of the opportunities that international cooperation offers by way of means of implementation in order to facilitate every country’s participation in global efforts, and particularly that of middle-income countries. Our country has launched the Geneva Pledge for Human Rights in Climate Action, a voluntary initiative based on recognition of the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights and the impact and consequences of climate change, and we call on all States to commit to it.
The gap between words and deeds only increases mistrust and erodes multilateralism. Costa Rica refuses to accept a situation that undermines the authority of the United Nations, puts us in a very vulnerable position in the face of threats old and new, and damages our much-needed Organization’s legitimacy in the minds of its Member States and the international community as a whole. That is why it should be here in the General Assembly that we say that we, the people, wish to be able to live in peace, freedom, equality, justice and democracy and to have the opportunity, in the words of that apostle of Cuban independence, José Martí, to create, believe and grow. Those words resonate today more than ever.
Terrorism, organized crime, drug-trafficking and worldwide pandemics are proof that threats to a nation’s security are no longer confined within its borders. Collective threats must be addressed collectively. The violations of the most basic human rights, above all the right to life, committed by terrorists and other so- called non-State actors, as well as the dreadful acts that have been perpetrated in areas affected by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant against women and girls and other vulnerable groups, pose a serious threat to international peace and security.
Costa Rica strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, regardless of the perpetrators or their purposes. In the face of the human tragedy of still uncertain proportions caused by the displacement of civilians fleeing violence, Costa Rica emphasizes the importance of seeking a global, collaborative and integrated approach that can enable us to speedily address this critical situation in a sustained manner. History shows that we get better results when we place cooperation above confrontation, tolerance above terrorism and ideas above radical ideologies.

Regarding the fight against terrorism, Costa Rica is concerned about the use of sexual violence as a tactic of terror and the links between violent extremism and control over women’s autonomy and its effects on and restrictions of their rights. We are also worried about the growing use of armed drones outside conflict zones and about various Governments’ reinterpretations of human rights and humanitarian principles. My country believes it is urgent that we take action to better understand this issue and address all of its implications. It is here at the United Nations, through our disarmament bodies, that we should begin to adopt measures that increase transparency and ensure accountability regarding their use.
To mark its seventieth anniversary, let us make the United Nations a more robust, dynamic and energetic organization that, rather than debating abstract concepts, seeks practical and specific solutions. Let us start by electing the first woman to occupy the post of Secretary-General and ensuring that the process is an inclusive, transparent and equitable one that will give us a visionary, independent, strong leader who will be the first to react, lead and act on humankind’s most urgent challenges and crises.
Let us demand coherence and consistency from the permanent members of the Security Council regarding the rule of law and international law, arms control and nuclear disarmament, to cite three examples. The Council is a key part of global governance, and its legitimacy depends on the consistency of its actions. Let us also work to strengthen the General Assembly and its bodies with the aim of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire Organization.
Let us protect the innocent civilians who are the deliberately targeted victims of unspeakable crimes of sexual violence and attacks by chemical weapons, cluster munitions, armed drones and barrel bombs. Sovereignty does not and should not protect Governments that commit atrocities against their own people. Let us end impunity and back efforts to commit to and adopt a code of conduct that prevents the use of the veto in cases of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Let us together combat terrorism, which is spreading like wildfire and is an increasing threat to international peace and security, human rights, universal culture and sustainable development. And let us do so in strict observance of international law,
including standards of human rights, international humanitarian and international refugee law. We cannot overstate the danger of self-serving reinterpretations of such standards, especially when they are used to justify unilateral action for solutions that should always be reached multilaterally.
Let us work without ceasing and without excuses for a culture of peace. As the seat of the University for Peace, now in its thirty-fifth year, Costa Rica calls on all States for their support in providing it with the resources it needs to fulfil its important task of educating the leaders that our world needs if it is to prevent and resolve conflicts and promote lasting peace.
In commemorating our Organization’s seventieth anniversary, let us remember the importance of keeping our doors open to new realities; to civil society and non-governmental organizations; to women; to young people, with whom we should engage in promoting reconciliation and sustainable peace; to groups with suggestions, such as the Elders; to collaboration between United Nations system agencies so as to provide holistic responses to the challenges we face; to the regional and subregional organizations that also play a crucial role in conflict prevention and management; to all peoples and individuals and their ideas, dreams, beliefs and aspirations; and to change and readiness to act.
The Costa Rican poet Jorge Debravo once said that over the ages, humankind has continued to ascend an unending upward path to progress. It appears that sometimes we have regressed. We have only stopped along the way for self-affirmation. Seventy years in human history seems of no longer duration than a gust of wind. However, when we measure those years in terms of the lives that have been saved, the agreements reached and the progress made in finding common solutions to the gravest crises that humankind has confronted, the passage of seventy years begins to feel monumental. It is extraordinary what we can accomplish when we stand together and act as one.
In closing, I cite the optimistic words of my teacher poet Debravo:
“The world is moving towards an era of love and brotherhood. Misery shall disappear from the face of the Earth. Equal rights and opportunities shall prevail despite those who struggle to enslave them. Join me in the fight, brothers! For what must come will come sooner if our arms turn the windmills of history together!”
"

Seventy years have passed since the establishment of the United Nations. People live differently now; many changes have taken place and many reforms have been effected. It is time that we reform the United Nations as well. I call on the President to speed up this process during his mandate.
Perhaps no other session in the history of the General Assembly has come at a more opportune time. Last year saw many new developments. Negotiations, which were unimaginable before, were started to end the embargo on Cuba. An agreement was reached to lift sanctions on Iran. We recognize those who took part in making these historic decisions and encourage them to see these changes through to completion. This is very much in line with the policy my country has pursued for a number of decades.
The world of today does not resemble the world of yesterday, and none of us can remain indifferent to this fact. Ours used to be a bipolar world, divided into blocs. We did not thrive because the poles were violently
15-29568 3/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
opposed to one another and had access to the most dangerous weapons the world possessed at the time. But we are also not doing well in a world with one Power that carries out diplomacy by issuing threats, oblivious to the concerns of all others, including those of the United Nations. Peoples and States attend to their own interests and are thereby exposed and open to extremist religious fanatics, giving rise to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and other extremist movements. These terrorist groups now threaten millions of people and have created a negative image of Islam, the religion on whose behalf they profess to act.
The two key elements of law and ethics were once key in international relations and politics. United States President Woodrow Wilson was a staunch advocate, while the great Serbian poet Njegoš expressed it in verses of The Mountain Wreath in the following way:
Along his path who maketh Might his right
Rise stenches of inhuman cruelty ...
[and]
As Wolf doth on the Sheep impose his might,
So tyrant lords it over feebler fellow;
But foot to place upon the Tyrant’s neck,
To bring him to the consciousness of Right —
This of all human duties is most sacred!
Today, however, legal and ethical factors are essentially being eclipsed in international politics. Not infrequently, unlawful and exceedingly immoral actions are being taken, purportedly for ethical and legal reasons. This happens most often when a clear legal norm that brooks no exception — such as the need for the Security Council to take a decision, for instance — stands in the way of a major Power achieving its geopolitical goals. International law, therefore, and the moral tenets underpinning a legal norm and its implementation, are deeply in crisis today. There is ample evidence of this, including the most recent large-scale crisis. Some call it a migrant crisis; others refer to it as another wave of people migrating for various reasons.
What worries us, though, is that those who think that efforts should be intensified in the hope of restoring peace quickly and easily and promoting economic progress for all — developing countries, in particular — are few and far between. We ought
to look each other in the eye and assess the past year with an open mind. We ought to announce what has been achieved in our countries. Some of us ought to ask themselves if their actions helped humankind or threatened the future of our children. Can we still begin our speeches with “We, the peoples of the United Nations”? Are we any closer to peace and prosperity or are we rushing, with blindfolds on, towards another 1939, which saw the start of a major world tragedy that lasted six years and whose consequences we shall never be able to erase?
Some of the mighty and powerful seem to believe that the world economic crisis did not do enough to terrify our children and their parents. They continue to use highly sophisticated weapons to drive people from their homes and countries and thrust them, in fear for their lives, into the turmoil of migration, journeying thousands of kilometres in a world without food, water or electricity.
The responsibility for these developments lies not with those who struggle to fight poverty and create conditions in their countries conducive to a dignified human life, or with Serbia, which has opened soup kitchens in order to give many their only daily meal. It lies with those who have much, whether God-given or gained by exploiting others. It lies with those who spend more on arms than all the world’s poor countries together spend on food. It lies with all of us, because we cannot contemplate sustainable development without accepting our shared responsibility to tackle one of the world’s major challenges — eradicating or at least alleviating poverty.
I often wonder how parents can look their children in the eye as they tell them that school and learning are important for their future and a normal life, and try to convince them that they will have food on their plates once they finish school and acquire learning. We do not learn when we live in fear, have nothing to eat or are threatened by disease, when our parents are unemployed or we face the threat of a terrible war. Those here representing the rich and powerful should think about that as they put their children to bed in a warm room at night and make important decisions during the day. Are profits and political or military superiority really worth so much that we no longer feel the sufferings of others but rather let baser instincts take over? Peace and prosperity cannot be a privilege for the people of certain countries alone; every man and woman on planet Earth has a right to them. That
4/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
is why we hold out a helping hand in our quest to achieve the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) through shared actions aimed at creating a better future for humankind, based on principles that can ensure progress and prosperity for all.
Sustainable development is clearly a concept accepted by most of the world. It postulates a global economy linking every region of the world on a basis of trust, ethics, equality and support, as well as a comprehensive approach to managing development by analysing and assessing the efforts of Governments and businesses. All management, however, requires that certain rules be established, and the question therefore is: Who will establish the rules and where? Can individuals, or groups of individuals, foresee all possible future events and developments, and is it possible to control those events and developments at all? Are we simply establishing a new global power centre, oblivious to the individual specifics of States or groups of States, an organization that has only one solution to all problems? What can we do about the fact that some of the Goals do not correspond to some countries’ specific situations? We must understand that we cannot control everyone’s lives even if we think it may be risky to leave things up to their free will.
Major changes in the way we live demand that we allow time to adjust to ensure that basic values do not collapse. Today, the world is extraordinarily interconnected in miraculous, virtual ways; information is exchanged and people and goods move at unprecedented speed. But the people themselves have never been so alienated. In huge cities, amid millions, people die alone. Individuals, States and international organizations become alienated. There are many reasons for this. Increasingly, relations among States are based on the more powerful, affluent and developed imposing their will on others.
We hope that our new era will usher in a new beginning, a new way of thinking, whose essence will be, as it should, in the best interests of people and their immediate and larger communities. We all understand that this is not easy to achieve, for modern communications can be used to impose a way of thinking aimed at implementing ideas that are not in the interests of the majority. Modern man’s urge to conform and daily struggle to meet ever greater demands, along with the spectre of unemployment and hardships in
later life, undermine his resolve to resist increasingly evident violations of basic human rights.
The world today is tragically divided between a few enormously rich individuals and a majority who live outside the boundaries of human dignity. The twenty-first century threatens to be an age in which some countries accumulate and concentrate enormous individual wealth and the rest are consigned to poverty and uncertainty. Among those wealthy individuals is also an entirely new generation of privileged directors who, unjustifiably and immorally, are paid far more than their employees. It seems, however, that the numbers of those willing to protest this phenomenon has been growing to a point where their demands may have to be acceded to. I urge everyone to work together to help to achieve an equitable distribution of the world’s assets and resources.
We continue to talk noncommittally about another major challenge, that of climate change, as if its consequences were not patently evident everywhere, and as if we did not see that they are exacerbating the friction caused by the already high level of inequality in the world. In a wake-up call of sorts, the consequences of our past and current actions now have the greatest effect on the weakest of us, the countries that are still undeveloped industrially and struggling to provide their citizens with a better life.
Most developing countries account for just a fraction of global warming. They must be given the opportunity to grow their economies under the same conditions that have already enabled other countries to prosper, even though their greenhouse gas emissions may be higher than the rich would like. We must develop technologies that can enable developing countries to develop while being as environmentally responsible as possible, rather than using concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global warming as pretexts to allow their industry to stagnate. There are moral reasons, too, for ensuring that countries develop. Politicians should be tasked with providing full support to scientific activities, on the one hand, and harmonizing and coordinating responses to climate change and extreme weather situations, on the other. Adapting and preparing national and social responses to potential scenarios, including worst-case scenarios, should be our most basic and important goal.
Serbia’s Government and scientific institutions, in full compliance with the relevant international documents, first and foremost among them the United
15-29568 5/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, will continue to contribute to the activities of the United Nations and other organizations, primarily through European and regional initiatives on climate monitoring and reducing the negative effects of climate change. Serbia welcomes the forthcoming twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC to be held in Paris later this year. We intend to support and make a full contribution to consideration of this important issue. We will continue to work together with others as a team and an active participant, in hopes that scientists will come up with clear answers and irrevocable proof as soon as possible, while politicians support them and implement speedy, effective solutions.
We can hope for a better future only if we overcome problems such as hunger, wars and diseases. Serbia has therefore actively participated in peacekeeping operations all over the world and has made every effort to train and equip growing numbers of its officers and soldiers to take part in such important assignments. In that regard, this year Serbia’s chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has been universally commended, including by those currently in conflict situations. I should also add that Serbia has been a candidate country of the European Union for more than three years now and has continued to take decisive steps to harmonize its systems and practices with European Union standards. At the same time, Serbia has also continued to maintain its cooperation and friendship with Russia and China.
A State is made up of its territory, its people, its languages and its cultural heritage. Serbia is the only country in Europe that in addition to seeing part of its territory seized, its people expelled and their murders and the so-called harvesting of their organs going unpunished, has now had to deal with attacks on its cultural heritage under the protection of UNESCO. Here I recall that in March 2004, in the face of only sporadic opposition from the Kosovo Force (KFOR), Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija destroyed numerous Christian Orthodox churches, other church buildings, convents, bell towers and monastery libraries and archives, usually by setting fires or explosive devices. That was only the brutal and effective perpetuation of the damage and destruction of over 140 Orthodox sanctuaries perpetrated since the arrival of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the KFOR in June 1999. In that period, the Albanian
terrorists systematically destroyed the spiritual and cultural heritage of the Serbian people in Kosovo and Metohija. Their centuries-long existence there is evinced in the many monasteries and churches whose foundations were laid before the ninth century and represent Serbian deeds etched in stone, the testimony of the Serbian presence in Kosovo and Metohija.
At the thirty-first session of its General Conference, UNESCO confirmed that a crime against a cultural heritage was committed in Kosovo and Metohija. In the small territory of Kosovo and Metohija, UNESCO has registered 372 highly valuable cultural monuments of the Serbian people, as clearly defined by UNESCO standards. As many as 49 monuments from the Middle Ages have been identified as a part of European and world heritage in which humankind can take pride and honour. Specifically, they served our pride and honour. These invaluable and unique works of art and architecture have survived five centuries of Ottoman rule, the Balkan Wars and the First and Second World Wars.
Yet, there they were, in 2004, being savagely desecrated and destroyed, buried and ploughed over, as though that undertaking was a part of preparations, designed with meticulous precision, to coincide with the unilateral declaration of independence of the Republic of Kosovo, an event that ensued four years after the barbaric destruction of the patrimony of Serbia’s Christian culture and civilization. Not only Serbian, but also European culture and the world’s collective memory are preserved in Kosovo and Metohija, representing an important human civilizational achievement on planet Earth. It is therefore important that Serbia, as a member of UNESCO, continues to be the keeper of this cultural treasure, which belongs both to Serbia and to the world.
In an attempt to falsify history — unfortunately with the support of a certain number of countries — Albania has submitted, on behalf of the Pristina Administration, a request to UNESCO that the Serbian heritage be declared Kosovar — that is, Albanian. Those who strategically destroyed monasteries with the aim of marginalizing the importance of Kosovo and Metohija for the Serbs and of establishing a new ethnic and cultural identity for Kosovo and Metohija on the ashes of the history of others, would be rewarded in that way. How is it possible that arsonists and destroyers, with goals that clearly go beyond all the ethical norms and established rules on which UNESCO was founded,
6/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
are now trying to project themselves as guardians and protectors?
Should that request be accepted nonetheless, a dangerous precedent would be set and the door would be opened for the legitimization of violence against the national, cultural and religious identity of any people anywhere. By defending the right of Serbia to preserve and proudly present its identity and cultural heritage, as it has done for the past 11 centuries, by preventing the unscrupulous dispossession of one’s heritage and its attribution to somebody else, we are defending the underlying principles of international law and human justice, as well as those on which UNESCO was founded. I therefore call on all Heads of State not to allow the Serbian people to have its soul excised, its essence usurped and its monasteries in Kosovo and Metohija, its spiritual backbone, declared the cultural heritage of the Albanian people there. In short, that is neither the truth nor a historical and scientific fact. It is not justice.
Peoples do not acquire history and civilization by snatching centuries of the existence of others or by bribing, with Judas’ silver, those to whom the history of others means nothing and who would stand by indifferently if the spiritual and cultural roots of a people — in this case of we Serbs — were removed from the areas from which they had been expelled. The United Nations must preserve its credibility and stand up to the injustice and evil that Serbia would suffer if the Organization acquiesced to that undertaking. I am certain that those gathered here, as responsible and honourable persons of State, will stand up against the injustice and wrong that would be inflicted upon Serbia and could have a domino effect on other nations and States.
Serbia is talking to the representatives of the Administration in Pristina. It will fulfil all its obligations under Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and all its obligations under the agreements reached in Brussels, but it will never, ever recognize the independence of part of its territory, the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija, to which its very existence is connected.
The problem of the mass migration from the Middle East is the greatest challenge of our times. We cannot analyse the causes and or identify those directly and indirectly responsible for the migrant crisis here and now. It is an issue of paramount importance and should be addressed at an international forum that would bring
together prominent leaders and eminent scholars and scientists. That is the best way to assess the situation objectively, provide an answer and propose a solution to that complex problem. The humanitarian disaster facing the world is only a consequence of the crisis that has shaken Syria for the past four years, all along without an adequate response from the international community.
Without access to common funding, the situation of Serbia is perhaps more difficult than that of the other countries of the old continent. Despite its difficult economic situation, Serbia is making every effort to provide decent conditions and accommodation for refugees. However, if the international community, and the European Union above all, fails to make concrete efforts to solve the problem, a humanitarian catastrophe of an even larger scale would threaten South-East Europe. The consequences are impossible to foresee, but they would surely affect not only Europe, but the whole world as well. As regards the number of asylum- seekers in the Republic of Serbia, 125,138 persons arrived in Serbia between 1 January and 14 September, and only 524 have submitted asylum requests.
I would like to draw attention to the alarming practice of some Governments that have erected wire and razor fences to ghettoize the asylum-seekers fleeing war and destitution. Such an attitude runs counter to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the proclaimed solidarity of the States members of the European Union with migrants. It also aggravates the situation in countries that respect international law and treat the individuals struck by calamity humanely. The Governments of certain States Members of the United Nations behave as if they had never abandoned the ideology that prevailed before the end of the Second World War, thereby destroying the fragile stability in the Balkans that was achieved through hard work and dedication, to which Serbia contributed the most.
My country has had to cope with a deep economic crisis since 2008. Refugees, therefore, cannot expect to secure much more than their personal safety in Serbia. We will provide it to them irrespective of the fact that certain countries also intervene against people living in Serbian territory. Our care for humankind and our empathy for those in need, as well as our resolve to give those people what we may not need as urgently as they do at the moment, will not diminish. Our borders are open to receive them and to let them through. We need no law for that because that is the way we are. Serbia is
15-29568 7/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
not a member of the European Union, but it consistently implements the proclaimed principle of solidarity, a fundamental value and the supposedly unconditional mainstay of the Union itself. I do not understand this selfishness, and sometimes even the hatred towards those who have nothing that some individuals have come to nurture. If the rapid pace with which the leaders of some countries are losing their cool and composure are any clue, the situation can only deteriorate.
We therefore need a comprehensive plan that would have to be implemented within the shortest possible time. Without such a plan, migrants will be left altogether at the mercy of human smugglers. Passivity and the increasingly inhumane treatment of migrants open a market for smugglers. The sequence of catastrophes that would ensue in such a case, from the Mediterranean to the British Isles, would be tragic, and the tragedy in which over 800 people died would be remembered as just one sad link in that sorry chain.
Even though it was not directly involved in the conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, started and stage-managed in a similar way to the conflict in Syria, Serbia was labelled guilty. A resolution was even recently submitted to the Security Council to stigmatize the Serbs as an example of a genocidal people, although such a characterization of any people in the world is unjustifiable. The attempt failed, as members of the Security Council were aware of the true intentions and desires of the initiators, as well as the possible catastrophic consequences. What kind of genocidal criminals are we? Is it the image imparted by the footage of migrants in Serbia, undaunted and unworried about the reaction of our people and authorities, unlike elsewhere in the region, or is it the image of a hospitable people with a kind heart? Have Serbian citizens changed? They have not. The people of Serbia of all ethnicities have, now and in the past, been humane and hospitable, as well as good neighbours.
In addition to refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq, Serbia hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons from the territory of the former Yugoslavia. They are preponderantly Serbs, but include also Bosniaks, Croats, Roma and others. Some of these people have gone to third countries, while others continue to live in Serbia. We are still faced with the consequences of these migration as they have altered the demographic, social and other structures of our country and society. Then and now, my country has
not had much to offer to these destitute people who left their homes. It has shared the little it had.
Serbia expects the United Nations Member States to act responsibly and humanely. We should all bear in mind that this situation will have global consequences. Civilization is at a crossroads. Europe is going through serious travails and tribulations. Now is the time for it to show if it still is the standard-bearer in the implementation of human rights and the respect of international law or if it continues to turn a blind eye to the apparent double standards and allows the attainment of civilization to be valid only for some countries and some peoples.
Equality is applicable not only to relations among individuals, but also to relations among States. Our fathers shed blood on many battlefields for the equality of all peoples. They fought for our freedom to speak our mind and for our opinion to be strong enough to change things. Freedom and equality are the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations, of numerous international documents and of national constitutions. We must not allow them to become dead letters.
By taking up these topics and drawing members’ attention to them, I hope to motivate us to show genuine empathy and solidarity, to take responsibility for the future and to build, together and indefatigably, true humanism in the Organization that gathered us together here today. I would like us to meet in this place with different messages next year and, if not with our problems solved, then at least with steps made towards solving the problems that burden us today. I would like us to be better every coming year. I would like the States of the world to feel that the ideas of liberty and equality and of a humane and just society are not just empty rhetoric, but instead genuinely resolve to implement them throughout our planet.
"
70,2015,BHR,"At the outset, it is my pleasure to warmly congratulate the President and his friendly country, the Kingdom of Denmark, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I wish him sustained success in directing the work of the General Assembly and in bolstering the role that the Assembly plays in addressing the challenges that the world and the international community as a whole face today. I also wish to express my appreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the General Assembly at the sixty-ninth session, for all his efforts in conducting the business of that session and for his concrete initiatives aimed at attaining our common goals.
I would also like to express my deep appreciation for the hard work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who spares no effort to improve the effectiveness of the Organization in the face of the increasingly complex problems and crises in the world. I commend his comprehensive annual report on the work of the Organization (A/70/1) and the important steps that he has taken to address the numerous challenges on issues, including sustainable development, climate change, conflicts, humanitarian disasters and the refugee crisis, in addition to the deadly diseases, poverty and hunger in many developing countries.
At this juncture, I wish to totally submit myself to the will of Allah and express our heartfelt condolences to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Majesty King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud of the brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and to the Muslim nation as
26/45 15-29816

a whole, following the tragic stampede that occurred during this year’s Hajj a few days ago. We highly value the great and historic role played by the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its blessed efforts as guardian of that holy land and as servant of the guests of the sacred shrine, dedicating all means necessary to the organization of the Hajj and Umrah and their rites. Anyone who denies that fact ignores the scope of the responsibilities that the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia discharges so ably. We strongly deplore the false allegations made by President Hassan Rouhani of the Islamic Republic of Iran in his statement before the General Assembly (see A/70/PV.13) and reject any offense against or belittling of the tremendous efforts made over the years by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
A few days ago, the General Assembly took an important step for the welfare of humankind by adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). We made it a point to participate in the process, which is consistent with our full support for United Nations actions aimed at furthering development goals and with the Kingdom of Bahrain’s record of achieving remarkable results in the fields of education, health, youth empowerment, poverty alleviation, literacy and the enhancement of human rights, as documented in international reports.
Bahrain, as a pioneering country, has been classified in the United Nations Human Development Index as being among the countries with a very high level of human development. It has scored a 5 per cent economic growth rate over the past five years, thanks to the reform process instituted by His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain and his profound interest in meeting the aspirations of the people of Bahrain at the political, economic and social levels. We shall persevere in our development efforts by devising plans and programmes for the implementation of the new post-2015 sustainable development agenda.
In the context of our efforts to enhance the Sustainable Development Goals contained in the new Agenda, my country will host, on 6 and 7 December, the Ministerial Conference on the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the Arab States. It will be the first regional conference to be held anywhere following the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The world testified to the success and excellent record of the Kingdom of Bahrain in the field of sustainable development when, here in New York, the
International Telecommunication Union conferred an Information and Communications Technologies in Sustainable Development Award for 2015 on His Royal Highness Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bahrain, thereby confirming the esteem in which the Kingdom and His Royal Highness are held, as evidenced by a series of distinguished awards in the recent past.
Given that the environment is one of the three dimensions of sustainable development, we want to stress the importance of solidarity and joint action to address the major challenges of climate change. We look forward to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held later this year in Paris. We hope that the session will result in a binding and ambitious agreement to deal with that dangerous phenomenon and its repercussions, especially on small island developing States.
The current session of the General Assembly coincides with the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, an Organization that we all cherish, whose indispensable role we all appreciate and which, for us, is indispensable. We shall relentlessly endeavour to attain its goals, especially in the light of the tragedies and hardships faced by humankind at the end of the Second World War, with its huge toll in lives, the displacement of peoples and the obliteration of a great number of cultural monuments in many parts of the world. All of that should make us firmly united, cooperative and transparent, so as to avoid the recurrence of such past tragedies and to lay strong foundations for international cooperation leading to safe future for humankind.
It is no secret that the Organization’s noble humanitarian goals have not been fully attained, yet we still maintain the hope of achieving them, thereby closing a painful and cruel chapter and inaugurating a new era without wars. Our region has had its share of wars — war after war, albeit of various types and objectives — and all were destructive. We have seen confrontations with occupiers. We have seen opposition to foreign interference that has sought to impose hegemony, undermine national sovereignty and exploit extremist groups and organizations as well as those financing them in order to jeopardize any national gains, destroy cultural heritage and obliterate national and regional identities.
Taking on those challenges is not easy, nor is the way carpeted with flowers. Rather, it is a long and
15-29816 27/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
arduous road, requiring uninterrupted work, persistent efforts and collective confrontation with the difficulties that need to be overcome. Paramount among them is the disregard by some – Iran, for example — of the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and of good-neighbourliness. There is also the exploitation of extremist groups, the provision of safe havens to fugitives, the opening of training camps for terrorist groups and the smuggling of arms and explosives. My country has experienced that directly. Bahraini citizens and expatriates, the security personnel protecting them, and the nation at large have been the targets of murder and other criminal acts that have claimed the lives of 16 security personnel and injured some 3,000 people.
Those dangerous criminal acts go even further. Barely two days ago, the security authorities in the Kingdom of Bahrain discovered a cache of locally made bombs in the heart of a densely populated area. The cache included some 1.5 tons of highly explosive material destined for use in the manufacturing of such potent explosives as C4, RDX and TNT, together with other chemical substances and a number of explosive devices ready for use, automatic weapons and guns, hand grenades, ammunition and wireless equipment.
For that reason, I would like to state that the Kingdom of Bahrain and a number of sisterly countries in the region have attempted, through various ways and means, to invite Iran to seek normal neighbourly relations based on respect for the sovereignty and independence of nations and non-interference in their internal affairs. The security and stability of a State cannot be detrimental to those of another State. Iran would be better advised not to squander the resources of its people on foreign adventures but rather to use those resources to achieve development and progress and build bridges with its neighbours, so that all may live together in peace. Iran has responded in a negative manner, however, and we were left with no choice but to recall the Kingdom’s Ambassador to Iran and declare the chargé d’affaires of the Iranian Embassy a persona non grata, as part of the measures we have taken to protect our people and interests.
The Kingdom of Bahrain and its sister countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have not hesitated to support Yemen in response to a request by His Excellency Mr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, President of the Republic of Yemen, that we help the brotherly people of Yemen, who have been confronted
with rebel groups that benefit from Iranian support. Those groups failed to live up to their commitments and took over the institutions of the Yemeni State. Our aim was to curb the deterioration in the security and humanitarian situation there. The position taken by the GCC in support of Yemen is a matter of principle and a long-standing position arising from our conviction that Yemen’s security and stability constitute an integral part, not only of the security of the Arabian peninsula but also of the entire region at large.
That has inevitably led to military confrontation, as we had no other choice available to us. All roads were blocked by the obstinacy of the rebel groups and their belligerent designs with regard to the people of Yemen and the region. To paraphrase my brother, the late Prince Saud Al Faisal, we are not warmongers, but when the war drums are beaten, we will be ready. I say that to show that the GCC countries are, and have always been, advocates of peace, not war.
We are steadfast in our efforts to fulfil the aspirations of the Yemeni people, and we shall remain faithful to our position until those who have taken up arms have laid them down, until those who have overthrown the legitimate Government have abandoned their greed and put an end to the occupation of the State institutions, and until those who have broken the 2014 peace agreement have come back to their senses. Only then can the situation be conducive to bringing together all the factions of the Yemeni people through a constructive national dialogue based on the GCC Initiative and its implementation mechanism, the outcome of the comprehensive national dialogue and the Riyadh conference and the unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 2216 (2015), which provides the basis for a settlement of the Yemeni crisis.
We welcome the efforts of the United Nations in that respect. While we appreciate the humanitarian efforts of the United Nations in favour of Yemen and its people and the remarkable role played by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre in Yemen in conjunction with assistance provided by the GCC and other friendly countries, we urge the international community to intensify its assistance and alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people.
We regret that many States have become a breeding ground for terrorist groups and organizations, which have expanded under the cover of various sectarian and religious affiliations with the sole purpose of advancing
28/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
their own agendas aimed at controlling nations and obliterating the will of peoples. The Syrian experience is an abiding example. That country has become an arena for confrontation among terrorist organizations such as Daesh, Hizbullah and others, which has led, inter alia, to the destruction of ancient cultural sites in the country.
As Syria goes down this treacherous and slippery slope, we call for an end to the situation and the return of that sisterly country to its previous condition of unity, harmony, security and stability. To that end, foreign military intervention must cease, and a unanimously accepted political settlement, consistent with the final communiqué of the Action Group for Syria (A/66/865, annex), must be reached.
Reference to Syria automatically draws our attention to a related humanitarian crisis that requires all Member States to take concrete and tangible action to address it. I speak now of the crisis of the Syrian refugees and displaced persons. It represents the worst ramification of the current situation in Syria and is a major humanitarian disaster, unprecedented since the Second World War.
The GCC member States have not remained idle in the face of that tragic situation. They have taken comprehensive and practical humanitarian action by hosting around 3 million Syrian brothers and sisters and granting them permits to stay, with all the attendant rights, such as free education, health care, the right to employment and an acceptable standard of living. In that respect, we also appreciate the major contribution of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which is providing Syrians with care and opportunities for a decent life. We also call for concerted efforts to support Jordan and to share the great burden that it has taken up. I should also mention the considerable efforts of Egypt, Lebanon and Turkey in bearing that humanitarian burden.
With regard to the sisterly country of Iraq, we hope that the great efforts of Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi to unite the Iraqi people and overcome the challenges facing his country at this critical juncture will be crowned with success and that stability, security and peace will be restored. We call for the protection of Iraq’s territorial integrity, an end to foreign interventions, especially by Iran, and the preservation of Iraq’s stability. We call for an all-out war against terrorist groups such as Daesh and other armed militias that have found in Iraq favourable conditions for their activities.
Libya is not immune to the threats posed by international terrorist groups, and the situation there has deteriorated, as we all know. The only way out is for all of the parties to the Libyan crisis to commit to giving precedence to the highest interest of the nation in order to restore its security, stability and unity. We welcome the text for the framework to create a Government of National Accord so as to put an end to the fighting and bloodshed in this sisterly country.
We reiterate the consistent position of the Kingdom of Bahrain, which rejects terrorism in all its forms, regardless of its motivations or the entity backing or financing it. Terrorist acts by Daesh are unprecedented and constitute crimes against humanity. Such terrorism will stop only if a collective effort is made at all levels to destroy its sources of financing. That is consistent with our commitment to combating that threat, which jeopardizes the security and safety of our countries, as well as our shared humanity.
The Kingdom of Bahrain, in cooperation with the countries of the region and with the support of our allies, will work to defeat that threat. To that end, we have ben participating in the efforts of the Global Coalition to Counter Daesh, militarily, logistically, intellectually and in the field of communications.
In that context, in November last year, the Kingdom of Bahrain hosted the Manama Meeting on Combating the Financing of Terrorism. This November we will host a conference on the protection of civil society institutions against the risk of being exploited as channels for funds intended for terrorists. In the near future, we will also organize a conference on protection against improvised explosive devices, which are the favourite and most frequently used weapons of terrorist groups all over the world.
What is taking place today in Al-Quds Al-Sharif offends the feelings of all Muslims around the world, as they witness the violations committed by the occupying Israeli authorities and Israeli extremist groups against the sanctity of the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque Compound. Such illegal and inhuman acts run the risk of wrecking any chance for peace. Instead they create an atmosphere filled with more tension, violence, extremism and hatred, all of which do not contribute to building the human relations and mutual respect that all religions advocate.
Nor do such acts contribute to building peaceful societies that preserve national dignity and a culture
15-29816 29/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
of peaceful coexistence. To quote Egyptian President Anwar Sadat’s iconic phrase before the Israeli Knesset, “no one can build his happiness at the expense of the misery of others”.
Attaining that happiness will be possible only when the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are granted through the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, within the borders of 4 June 1967. Occupation, coercive practices and the construction and expansion of settlements should come to an end. The right of Palestinians to return to their towns and villages, consistent with the relevant international resolutions, the two-State solution and the Arab Peace Initiative, must be acknowledged.
In that connection, we welcome the raising of the Palestinian flag at United Nations Headquarters as a first step of great symbolic value, underscoring international support for the right of the Palestinian State to full membership in the United Nations, which we look forward to in the near future.
We want to reaffirm the importance of the agreement between Iran and the P5+1 group on the Iranian nuclear programme. We hope that it will contribute to security and stability in the region. However, we believe that the agreement does not eliminate all sources of tension resulting from Iran’s attitudes towards the countries of the region. It covers some future issues, but it does not touch on the real problems that we face today, since Iran will attempt to destabilize the region and its security by providing support to terrorist organizations, including by smuggling weapons and explosives, as I mentioned earlier in detail. Iran is also openly interfering in the internal affairs of our States. It has occupied the three islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates, namely, Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, and refuses to end that occupation either through direct negotiations or by accepting arbitration by the International Court of Justice..
In that context, we reaffirm the importance of a Middle East nuclear-free-zone, including the Arabian Gulf region, as well as the need for Israel to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to place its nuclear facilities under comprehensive safeguards if the International Atomic Energy Agency. I regret that no agreement was reached at the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, recently held in New York .
The Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates its full support for the Arab Republic of Egypt and the tireless efforts of President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi to achieve development, progress and prosperity for the Egyptian people, consolidate the foundations of a modern State and combat terrorism. The building of a new Suez Canal and the other major projects decided at the Sharm El-Sheikh Conference to support the Egyptian economy clearly demonstrate the determination to enhance genuine development so that Egypt, the land of civilization, will remain a source of security and prosperity for all and a pillar of the Arab world. In that way, it can continue playing its leading role in our common Arab endeavours to defend our cause and our national security.
Similarly, we would like to put on record our consistent and principled position vis-à-vis the Moroccan Sahara question. We express our support for the territorial integrity of Morocco and the efforts of the United Nations to find a negotiated political settlement accepted by all parties on the basis of the Moroccan initiative on self-government.
Confronted with such daunting challenges to our region’s long-term security and stability, we need more than ever to reflect deeply and seriously on how to create a mechanism for collective action that can bring all Middle Eastern States together with a view to consolidating security and stability. We need to discuss among ourselves, with clarity and transparency, all those issues and reach solutions to build confidence through practical policies and steady progress. We would then be able to preserve what we have already achieved for our peoples and countries in terms of construction, comprehensive development and mutual understanding and cooperation. Such a mechanism would preserve the sovereignty of our countries and their territorial integrity and ensure non-interference in their internal affairs.
Better relations would also ensue, based on mutual respect for the principles of good-neighbourliness and the non-use or threat of use of force. We would be able to build on the common characteristics that unite us, including our religious and cultural heritage and our diversity. That would allow for better management of our collective resources so as to achieve food and water security, build a genuine and lasting peace for all and achieve economic and development progress in the context of peaceful coexistence.
I want to conclude by stating that the many achievements of the Kingdom of Bahrain confirm our
30/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
confidence in our approach and our persistence in our policy of perpetual improvement and comprehensive growth, while enhancing our country’s security and preserving our identity. We defend ourselves with one hand and work to build a modern State with the other, a State based on justice, the rule of law and plurality, and popular participation in the decision-making process, without exclusion or discrimination. Our foreign relations are wide open and are built on strong foundations and principles, most notably respect for the Charter of the United Nations, efforts at the regional and international levels, and cooperation with our brothers aimed at achieving a peaceful life and a lasting and comprehensive peace for all.
"
70,2015,EGY,"I should like to express to the President the warm salutations of the people of Egypt. At the outset, I wish to congratulate him, and his friendly country, Denmark, on his assumption of the presidency at the current session of the General Assembly. I express my appreciation to his predecessor, the Foreign Minister of our brotherly country Uganda, for his exceptional efforts during his presidency at the previous session.
I should also like to commend the constructive role played by the Secretary-General and his ceaseless efforts to uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter, which has served as the constitutional bedrock and framework of reference for international relations for 70 years.
A few weeks ago, Egypt and the world witnessed the inauguration of the new Suez Canal, an achievement that will have a major impact in a number of economic fields, including transportation, trade and services. It is also a statement of Egypt’s capability and the determination of its people to work diligently to overcome challenges and obstacles. I do not intend to dwell on the particulars today, with which I am sure members are familiar. What I wish to highlight is the significance of what we in Egypt have achieved. The new Canal is not only Egypt’s gift to the world, it represents hope and the ability to transform that hope into tangible reality, with the promise of a new direction, through hard work.
Members may agree with me that hope, that most important attribute, has provided the motive force that has consistently driven individuals and peoples to search for a better tomorrow. When hope is coupled with hard work and commitment, it becomes a beacon of light
that can dispel the darkness of despair, a darkness that today lingers over the Middle East. Hope and hard work are the example that Egypt offers to its neighbours in Africa, Asia and the Mediterranean by way of a helping hand in overcoming the challenges of the present and illuminating the path towards the future.
It is our belief in Egypt that the Middle East and the world at large are living through perilous times and are in dire need of a model that offers new prospects for the younger generations, providing them with opportunities for a brighter future. They must be shown that with diligent work they can participate in crafting this future.
It is against this background that I announce Egypt’s intention to launch, in conjunction with the United Nations and its Member States and with the broad participation of the young people of all nations, an initiative called Hope and Action for a New Direction, or HAND according to the English acronym. This is the hand that Egypt extends as part of its contribution to defeating the extremists and the ideas they seek to spread. The initiative will employ proactive measures rather than relying on resistance alone. This is in contrast to the counter-terrorism efforts so far, which have consisted solely of defensive reactions aimed at preserving the status quo. In parallel with those efforts, we must seek ways of keeping our young people safe from extremists and false ideas and of channelling their productive energies and capabilities into building the future that will soon be their own.
God has bestowed on humankind the gift of the mind, thereby enabling us to find Him. The fact that we can use this mind to make choices is the ultimate proof that our differences and diversities are a product of divine will, which does not accept that human beings should be devoid of purpose. Before that simple, palpable truth, all the arguments made by extremists of all religions and creeds fall apart, particularly arguments made by those who claim to have a monopoly over interpreting Islam. They forget that what they preach is nothing more than their own prejudiced interpretation of religion, which negates the truth of Islam’s tolerance, justice and mercy. Their rejection of the right of others to differ is a rejection of the Creator’s will. In reality, their goals are worldly and insidious, and they seek to recruit and indoctrinate followers and isolate them from any opportunity to acquire a genuine understanding of religion.
But more than 1.5 billion Muslims have refused to subscribe to the views of this small minority, which claims to speak on their behalf and which seeks through violence and extremism to marginalize and silence all those who oppose their designs. The whole world should realize this. I feel the distress of every Muslim who suffers from discrimination and prejudice solely because of belonging to this great religion. Such discrimination is doubtless viewed by the forces of extremism as an unprecedented triumph, as one of their primary goals is to create the widest possible gulf between Muslims and the rest of the world.
Allow me then to pose this question: How many Muslims must fall victim to the abominations of terrorism and extremism before the world recognizes that we all, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, are at war with the same enemy? That we face the same threat? How much blood must be spilled in countries exposed to terrorism before the international community awakens to the reality of this scourge, which Egypt is now confronting as a front-line Islamic country? When will the international community acknowledge that there is no alternative to solidarity between all peoples to defeat this evil, wherever it exists?
We all witnessed the downward spiral of Libya when the forces of extremism made their presence known through actions that contradicted the principles of Islam and humanity. The slaughter of Egyptians on the coast of Libya was the result of complacency in confronting the expansion of extremists in defiance of the will of the Libyan people, tolerating their exclusivist tendencies and allowing them to hold hostage the destiny of Libya and its people.
Egypt’s deep concern for Libya’s future, security and stability were the main driving force behind our support for United Nations efforts to reach a peaceful settlement. This support played a significant role in achieving the Libyan political agreement, the Skhirat Agreement, which should be considered a milestone. From this point onwards, the international community should consolidate its efforts and strengthen its support for the parties to the Agreement with a view to rebuilding the Libyan State, empowering it effectively to combat terrorism and enhancing its capacity to defeat the terrorists before they can establish a base from which to target Libya’s neighbours and extend their influence. In this context I should like to emphasize the importance of continuing to foster an environment that is conducive to increased participation among Libyans who believe
in a modern State, in parallel with an unflagging effort to eradicate terrorism.
In Syria, too, we have all observed how extremists have exploited the legitimate aspirations of the people and have dragged this brotherly nation into a chaos designed only to further their own interests. In fact, conflicts have erupted between extremist organizations themselves in the struggle over the spoils. Today, Syria is being torn apart. It is facing a major humanitarian crisis, and the ambitions of regional parties have been exposed. In response to this dire situation, Egypt has called on the Syrian national parties to meet in Cairo to formulate a clear-cut plan for the interim period, as agreed in Geneva. That would provide a common ground for all Syrians to build a democratic Syria, with sovereignty over the entirety of its territory, and in a manner that would preserve the State and its institutions and protect its diversity and national identify. The Syrian national parties are invited today to participate meaningfully in all efforts to negotiate a political resolution to the crisis that reflects the aspirations of the Syrian people.
Egypt’s political and military support for Yemen and its participation in the steps taken by the coalition of States in support of the legitimate Government were in response to Yemen’s request. They also arise from our sense of the need to protect Arab national security in the face of external attempts to intervene in an Arab country’s domestic affairs, as well as our commitment to preserving Yemen’s unity, independence and territorial integrity. Egypt urges the international community to exert the necessary efforts to resume the transitional political process, in accordance with the Gulf initiative and its implementation mechanisms as well as the relevant Security Council resolutions.
Egypt is closely following the latest developments in Iraq, and we hope that the reforms implemented by the Government will contribute to restoring cohesion between the people of Iraq and advancing national reconciliation.
As Egypt has previously emphasized, the increasing plight of refugees fleeing from armed conflicts reaffirms the need to work towards resolving these conflicts and confronting the scourge of terrorism, which is a major aggravating factor. It necessitates creating channels for legal immigration and facilitating transportation, as well as linking international migration and development.
Egypt is host to an ever-increasing number of refugees, who share with their Egyptian brethren the social, education and health services provided by the State, in spite of the economic burden that this represents. Egypt hopes that the solutions to this crisis will be found, both in the short run to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of refugees and in the long run through overcoming the fundamental causes of this crisis.
The situations I have described point to the existing and ever-growing threat posed by terrorist organizations, which exploit political crises to achieve their objectives. It is incumbent on me, as President of Egypt, a country that is surrounded by such confrontations, to forewarn of the dangers that the expansion of this threat pose to other crises and regions, at the forefront of which is Palestine.
The question of Palestine is a just cause. Resolving the Middle East conflict and empowering the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination and to an independent State within the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, will effectively eliminate one of the most important factors underlying the region’s instability and used as a dangerous pretext to justify extremism and terrorism. Members will doubtless agree with me that it is imperative to end this conflict promptly, so that the nations of the region may focus on building their future together in order to achieve prosperity and build a better future for coming generations. The ongoing events in Jerusalem and at the Al-Aqsa Mosque demonstrate that achieving peace continues to face hurdles and challenges and that all of our efforts are required in the search for a definitive solution.
We in Egypt realize the importance of other factors, in addition to defeating terrorism and extremism, in efforts to achieve stability and comprehensive development. The Egyptian uprising and its call for change was an expression of our awareness of the need to build a modern nation, with all its components. We are aware that so far we have taken only a few steps and that the path is long. We are committed to following that path to the end, no matter the challenges we face.
This year, Egypt will hold parliamentary elections, in conformity with the road map for the future. The people’s representatives can then exercise their oversight and legislative responsibilities during the upcoming phase. That phase will witness, God willing, the further
realization of the Egyptian people’s aspirations for freedom, dignity and social justice. In this context, it is essential for me to highlight that the Government launched in March its sustainable development strategy, known as Vision 2030, in parallel with the international community’s pursuit of an ambitious post- 2015 development agenda.
We hope that this development agenda will take into consideration the importance of our common but differentiated responsibilities in confronting the global challenges based on a disparity in capacities and resources, as well as the diversity of our cultures. Development is a fundamental human right. To facilitate and promote that right, particularly in developing countries and in Africa, is a joint responsibility and top priority particularly for the developed world.
The vision Egypt is proposing is the continuation of a long journey, one which began with human history itself. Throughout this journey, Egyptians have continuously innovated. They have welcomed all those who have passed through their land; hence their contribution to human culture remains significant to this day. Currently, as a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the coming two years, Egypt aspires to enhance its participation and to consolidate international peace and stability. The confidence placed in Egypt by Member States will not be regretted. Egypt is aware of the responsibilities it is about to shoulder at this critical juncture and will endeavour to reflect the interests of Africa, the Arab region and the entire world. It will seek to uphold the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the values that unite human beings and civilizations.
The banks of the River Nile witnessed the establishment of the first building blocks of human civilization. Egypt remained for many centuries a centre of knowledge and art and a beacon of light for other countries and nations. In spite of the difficulties and setbacks endured by Egypt at other times, today the Egyptian people long to make history once again. I am confident that, with God’s help, the Egyptian people will be able to achieve their highest aspirations for themselves, their country, their region and the whole world. Long live Egypt!"
70,2015,BDI,"I would like first to thank God Almighty for guiding us throughout our trip and for continuing to be with us during our stay in New York.
I would like to express the fraternal greetings of the Burundian people and His Excellency Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic of Burundi, who asked us to represent him here today.
We take this opportunity to extend our warmest congratulations to the Mr. Lykketoft on the occasion of his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and to assure him of the full support of our country in accomplishing his noble mission. We also wish to congratulate Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, who brilliantly presided over the Assembly at its sixty- ninth session. We offer special thanks to Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his commendable ongoing efforts so that our Organization may continue to fulfil the goals and ideals that the Member States have set for it.
We would like to acknowledge the relevance of the theme chosen for this seventieth anniversary of our Organization: “Strong UN. Better World”. We assure the President of the strong support of the Republic of Burundi for achieving the three priorities that will guide his actions during his term: a commitment to action, an intensification of efforts by the United Nations to cement international peace and security, and significant progress in the area of human rights.
As some know, Burundi has just come through a period that has raised questions for some here today. I would briefly like to address them. Burundi has just completed an election process pursuant to the 2005 Constitution, which has remained unchanged, contrary to what some would have us believe. The process was a great success despite the violent protests that quickly turned into an insurrectionary movement in some neighbourhoods of the capital, Bujumbura.
The elections went well in Burundi, but during their preparation, while they were being held and afterwards, there were acts of sabotage, and the country fell victim to the machinations of some politicians whose plan was simply to destabilize institutions. Children were used as soldiers and human shields, to whom drugs, weapons and explosives were given so that they would
15-29664 7/25

A/70/PV.23 01/10/2015
commit acts of vandalism, killings and other acts of terrorism in public places. Everyone knows that the use of children for military purposes is in itself a crime against humanity. We regret to report that all this happened with the support of certain countries that sought to torpedo the Government’s efforts to restore the stability of our country.
We welcome United Nations support for the electoral process through the United Nations Electoral Observer Mission in Burundi, whose observers were deployed in much of the country. The decisions of the Constitutional Courts of Burundi and the East African Community, which confirmed the legality of the candidacy of Pierre Nkurunziza, were not enough to stop the insurrection initiated by the opposition and civil society. That proved once more their hidden agenda to destabilize the country. Yet everyone knows that the interpretation of the domestic laws of a country, including its constitution, is a matter for its legal authorities. This is also a reflection of the sovereignty of any independent country.
We believe that the peoples of this world must be respected in their choices. While remaining receptive to the advice of friends, the people of Burundi deserve to have the choice that they made in the recent elections respected. They do not ask for more than this, and it is a question neither of blind stubbornness nor, even less, of the obstinacy of a leader or a people, as some of our traditional friends from the North think.
The instigators of the aforementioned insurrection were supported by certain political parties without popular support that knew in advance they would lose the elections. Having therefore decided to bypass the ballot box, these political parties only wanted transitional arrangements similar to the Arusha negotiations as a stepping-stone to power. Their aim was to cause trouble in order to prove that it was impossible to organize the electoral process. Some media were unfortunately on their side. To amplify their action, certain non-governmental organizations supported them financially and morally at a time when some civil society organizations were stakeholders.
What was not known until now is that this insurrection was the tree that hid the woods, that is, the failed coup that was being prepared. It had been in preparation for some time by the same actors, in collaboration with some civil-society organizations. The date of 13 May 2015 will remain etched in the memories of the people of Burundi. Unable to seize
the institutions of sovereignty, the mutineers would use local and international media to announce to the nation and the whole world that they already had control of the national radio and television broadcasting system, that the international airport and all borders were closed, that the Constitution was suspended. In short, it was a veritable media war that did not reflect the reality on the ground in any way. The Government of Burundi appreciates for its true value the support of the international community, regional organizations, and the loyalist forces that quickly condemned the attempted putsch and which called for respect for the constitutional order.
After the failure of the coup d’état, some critics fled to one of our neighbouring countries, which has been sheltering them and assisting them in their campaign to destabilize our country. Burundi has remained watchful and condemns that hostile attitude, which contravenes the Charter of the United Nations and other relevant instruments of international and regional organizations of which we are members.
Faced with these problems in the wake of the failed putsch, the Summit of Heads of State of the East African Community recommended that the elections be postponed so as to enable all political parties and actors to participate under better conditions. Burundi acceded to the decision in order to head off any pretexts for contesting the results. The municipal, legislative and presidential elections were therefore postponed twice, but could not be delayed beyond the constitutional deadlines. At all costs we had to avoid ending up in a constitutional vacuum.
To mark Burundi’s democratic progress, we succeeded in introducing single ballots and consolidating several rounds of voting. After this electoral marathon, therefore, consultations between the country’s various political forces enabled us to establish the offices of both Houses of Parliament, with the participation of the former leader of the opposition, Mr. Agathon Rwasa, President of the Amizero y’Abarundi coalition. Following an internal dialogue, the new Government was named on 24 August and consists of 20 ministers, including five from the opposition. All of that was carried out in strict accordance with the Arusha Agreement and constitutional balance.
With the elections over, the Government of Burundi has now launched another political phase, that of dialogue, one that aims to be inclusive, sincere and open to all issues and that is embodied in the National
8/25 15-29664

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.23
Commission for inter-Burundian Dialogue, established by presidential decree on 23 September. Its main mission is to lead an inter-Burundian dialogue process on the issues both inside and outside the country, particularly as they relate to social issues, politics, peacebuilding, security, economic development, the Arusha Agreement, the Constitution, the comprehensive ceasefire agreement, the Charter of National Unity and so forth.
Based on the main conclusions of the discussions, the Commission will make recommendations to the Government, the political parties, civil society and religious groups in order to arrive at agreement on the changes to be made to the founding documents in the interests of all Burundians. The Commission will consist of 15 Burundian nationals appointed by decree and in accordance with the constitutional balances. We take this opportunity to once again ask for support for the process from Burundi’s partners, starting with the United Nations, which has recently demanded firmly that we organize a genuinely inclusive dialogue in our country.
It should be recalled that this dialogue framework comes a few months after the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, whose main task is to shed light on the crises that have dogged Burundi since its independence. With a continuing view to restoring an atmosphere conducive to peace and security throughout the country, the President of the Republic has just made another gesture of goodwill by signing a decree allowing those who illegally have weapons to return voluntarily within a month without fear of prosecution by the legal authorities. We should note that the decision is also a response to the disarmament recommendations of the Summits of Heads of State of the East African Community and of the African Union.
Concerning freedom of the media, which some have been concerned about, we would like it known that the issue is important to us, too. However, it is important not to lump all the media together. Of the 20 or so private media outlets operating in Burundi, only three radio stations and one television and radio broadcaster face judicial investigations into their alleged role in the failed coup of 13 May before it is decided whether they can reopen. Other representatives of the media, both national and international, operating on Burundian territory have continued to broadcast without difficulty. Moreover, the media will also occupy a prominent place in the inter-Burundian dialogue soon to begin.
Those arrested during the insurrection will receive a fair trial and have the right to a defence. We should emphasize that minors recruited into the movement through violence will be pardoned, and only those responsible for serious crimes will have to face trial. As to refugees, Burundi hopes to see more involvement on the part of its partners and friends in helping to facilitate the voluntary return of Burundians wishing to come home.
On the socioeconomic front, Burundi has made significant progress in recent years. Women and girls’ involvement in running the country is now a reality. Indeed, the Constitution reserves a quota of at least 30 per cent of seats for them in decision-making bodies. Women make up 50 per cent of the Senate and 36 per cent of the National Assembly. In the Government, women head important ministries such as those of health, education and higher education and scientific research, justice, trade and municipal development. As for women and armed conflict, we have made progress in recruiting women into the defence and security forces, which also contributes to their effective participation in peacekeeping missions.
Turning to education, free tuition has enabled us to achieve our ambition of having as many girls as boys in primary school. That policy, introduced in 2005 and based on community efforts, has also involved the population in building school infrastructure, which in 2014 enabled us to achieve a school-attendance rate of 96 per cent, compared with 59.5 per cent in 2005. In the health sector, free health care for children under the age of 5 and pregnant women has significantly reduced the mortality rate for children under 5 and for infants at birth.
In the area of transport infrastructure, all of the roads linking the country’s provinces are now paved, except for one in one province on which work is ongoing.
Among the important reforms introduced in recent years, I should mention that all revenues are now channelled through the Burundi Revenue Authority, whose establishment has given us a reliable taxation body harmonized with the East African Community. Based on the performances achieved with regard to the Millennium Development Goals, we are entering the era of the Sustainable Development Goals with confidence and are determined to implement, over the short and the long terms, every policy able to curb poverty in our country.

At the regional level, Burundi will continue to work with other countries to better respond to the security objectives laid out in the founding documents of the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries, the East African Community, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and many others.
On the international front, Burundi has pledged to continue the work it began nearly a decade ago in the spirit of international solidarity, namely, to participate in peacekeeping operations wherever asked to do so. Accordingly, we have not shrunk from the call to help our brothers and sisters in Somalia, so that they can regain their dignity. When we sent our troops to Somalia at the beginning of operations initiated by the African Union, Burundi became the second-largest troop-contributing country in Somalia. Our brave men and women are also contributing energetically to peacekeeping operations in the Central African Republic, Darfur in the Sudan, Côte d’Ivoire and Haiti. We will not only continue our commitments to the peacekeeping operations in which we are involved in a spirit of partnership and mutually beneficial cooperation, but, in the various international forums in which Burundi has a voice, it will also pursue building a more united and just world, a world in which States respect each other on an equal and sovereign footing.
Burundi wishes, however, that the United Nations and other partners would step up their support to troop- contributing countries in order to enable a rapid and effective response. Burundi embraces all strategies that aim to eradicate the major threat posed by terrorism and reaffirms its commitment to fight alongside the international community in the common struggle. We support the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) so as to prevent non-State actors in particular from obtaining biological, nuclear, chemical or other weapons in order to commit terrorist acts.
Burundi is firmly committed to working with all other bilateral and multilateral international partners to take up the challenge of climate change. Our country is part of a new political momentum that promises to provide a rapid solution to the problems related to climate change. Accordingly, we have high expectations for the session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December.
Regarding the issue of reforming the Security Council, our country subscribes to the logic of finding
a comprehensive solution that meets the broad approval of the Member States, and that will uphold the common interests of our States and serve the long-term interests of our Organization. It is therefore our wish that the decisions on this important issue reflect the views of the individual States and of the continental organizations to which they belong.
Ultimately, we, like the other developing countries, are asking for a more substantial amount of support from the United Nations and our partners, in order to make increased progress as we implement the new post- 2015 Agenda. For our part, we are committed to taking ownership of the Agenda from the grass-roots to the top level of our Government, for the benefit of the national and international community.
Lastly, Burundi wants stability in the Great Lakes region, based on the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and particular regard for the commitments made within the framework of regional organizations, which all advocate peace and security, as the foundation for all development.
Long live the United Nations family.
"
70,2015,GAB,"This session is being held at a time when humankind is facing numerous challenges, some more difficult than others. Migration crises, humanitarian crises, immigration crises, deadly conflicts, terrorism, economic crises, climate change and pandemics are the challenges we face. It is obvious that, 70 years after the establishment of the United Nations, we are increasingly aware of the dangers that those situations pose, both for us and for future generations. That explains our presence and activities here and elsewhere in an effort to coordinate our many actions. More than ever before, the eyes of our peoples are on the United Nations. More than ever before, our Organization has shown itself to be a unique forum that is universal in nature and where humankind’s diverse concerns and aspirations can be wholly expressed.
The topic of this session provides us with an opportunity to take a look at how our Organization works. It also affords us a chance to develop forecasts and new prospects for the Organization’s future activities, by basing them on the main pillars of its agenda, namely, peace, security and human rights. It is time to acknowledge the solid nature of the United Nations and its leadership, expressed through Member States constantly working together to manage international affairs. Together, we organized the fight against poverty and major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and we are now conquering Ebola.
Together, we have fought for the rights of vulnerable persons such as the disabled, the elderly, indigenous peoples and women and children, including widows and orphans. We should underscore, in passing, that in 2010
the General Assembly, on Gabon’s initiative, adopted the resolution to establish International Widows Day (resolution 65/189). We have come together to respond to humanitarian emergencies, global warming and other cross-border threats. Together, we are working to effectively respond to the many security challenges stemming from terrorism and other cross-border threats. Together, we have made progress in the area of international criminal justice in order to be more effective in combating impunity. Working together, we have also fostered dialogue among cultures and civilizations, strengthened relations among the peoples of the world and lowered identity barriers.
Despite our many efforts, however, international peace and security unfortunately continue to be threatened, as we witness in the emergence of new challenges. Our Organization must adopt a new structure in order to adapt to the new international environment. New threats have emerged in the form of terrorism, maritime piracy, trafficking of all kinds and smuggling. Such threats call for new kinds of responses. My country welcomes the fact that the Security Council is taking those new threats under its consideration. It is in that regard that Gabon contributed, when we were a member of the Security Council in 2010-2011, to adopting a historic resolution on the impact of the HIV/ AIDS epidemic on international peace and security (Security Council resolution 1983 (2011)).
In that same vein, I would like to mention the Security Council presidential statement on the illicit circulation of small and light weapons in Central Africa (S/PRST/2010/6). On the initiative of Gabon and Germany, the General Assembly adopted, on 30 July 2015, a resolution on illegal trafficking in wildlife (resolution 69/314). I am delighted at the large number of sponsors, which reflected an unprecedented level of support from the international community on the matter. That resolution also reflected our willingness to pool our efforts — countries of origin, transit and destination — in order to end that phenomenon. I believe that we will be more effective if we work together. Gabon would like to encourage the Organization, particularly the Security Council, to continue efforts to overcome those threats, with a view to developing more suitable and comprehensive responses to the current security challenges.
Several crises continue in Africa despite the efforts of the Security Council, the African Union and subregional organizations. In the Central African
Republic in particular, despite the progress made this year, the situation remains fragile and a cause for concern. Events in recent days have proved that the stability in the country must be strengthened. We must redouble our efforts to move towards a transition. I invite the stakeholders to exercise greater restraint and to prioritize dialogue so as not to undermine efforts being made to restore peace in the country. The international community must work together to assist the Central African Republic in holding elections before the end of the year. That country will then be able to put an end to the current troubled period in its history.
In the Middle East, the situation between Israel and Palestine remains a source of concern. The international community must become more involved in efforts to resume the peace negotiations. Resolving other, similarly complex situations in other regions of the world has proved that there is no challenge that cannot be overcome. The establishment of a Palestinian State remains the only viable prospect for guaranteeing peace in the subregion. We must work together to ensure that the State of Palestine and Israel can coexist in peace and mutual acceptance.
I would also like to welcome the positive developments this year in the relations between Cuba and the United States of America in the wake of the normalization agreement and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. I would like to believe that this development will soon result in the lifting of the embargo against Cuba.
The nagging question of the ongoing threat posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, can be resolved only within the framework of multilateral mechanisms, such as the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). My country remains firmly committed to the international system of non-proliferation, as enshrined in the relevant instruments, such as the NPT. That is why I welcome the recent agreement between the international community and the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning its nuclear programme.
The terrorist threat continues to expand throughout the world. Besides the Middle East, Africa has become a new theatre of operations for a number of terrorist groups. In West Africa and Central Africa, the Boko Haram sect spreads terror and resists countermeasures by the countries on the front line. In East Africa, especially in Somalia, Al-Shabaab commita devastating
atrocities and continues to challenge the African Union Mission in Somalia.
If we are to be more effective in the fight against terrorism, we must necessarily strengthen international cooperation. We must pool our efforts to address that scourge. With good international cooperation we could benefit from the increased monitoring of the financial flows that fuel the phenomenon. My country reaffirms its solidarity with all initiatives to combat international terrorism in all its forms.
There has been significant and undeniable progress in the area of human rights worldwide. Through United Nations assistance, political systems have become open and national institutions ensuring equality and justice for all have been put into place within nations. At the request of the Member States, the United Nations undertook the reform of the Commission on Human Rights and transformed it into the Human Rights Council. The goal was to make the body more proactive, less politicized and, above all, more effective. I welcome the part that my country played in that effort. The support that Member States gave the Gabonese presidency of the Council enabled Gabon make significant progress towards achieving the objectives intended by that reform. I wish to thank Member States for that support.
For my country, the improvement of human rights must first be considered from an educational, not a political, point of view. The United Nations must engage in an ongoing dialogue with Member States to help them overcome the challenges that they face with regard to respect for human rights. Confrontation in that area does not appear to be constructive to me.
The maintenance and consolidation of peace necessarily depends on the reform of the Security Council. That ambition also calls for the reform of peacekeeping operations. Gabon reiterates its support for making the Security Council more democratic so that it involves all regions when it developments and implements its decisions. It is from that perspective that we reiterate our full commitment to the African position, as expressed in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, and to the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations on the issue. The time is opportune to translate the reform, which has been accepted and desired by all, into action.
The question of the use of the veto is an integral part of the Security Council reform process. My
country supports the initiative of France and Mexico on the rational use of the veto by the Council’s permanent members.
For several years, peacekeeping operations, which are the specialized arm of the Security Council, have been the subject of profound restructuring. I welcome the recommendations of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. I am particularly interested in the recommendations concerning the use of new technologies and improved communications between local populations and mission personnel, on the one hand, and between the Secretariat and contributing countries, on the other. I also support that sustainable development during the post-conflict phase is being taken into account.
Furthermore, in order to be more effective, peacekeeping missions should receive predictable financing and clear mandates of limited duration so as to avoid their becoming unduly long. In certain circumstances, the mandates must be more robust, especially when there is no alternative but to impose peace. In that case, based on Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, we should be able to provide peacekeeping operations with mandates that authorize the military to resort to force to impose peace. We must be able to give peacekeeping operations the mandate to create conditions for peace rather than to maintain a fragile peace framed by a ceasefire agreement.
The revitalization of the work of the General Assembly is another aspect of United Nations reform desired by the majority of Member States. I welcome resolution 69/321 on that issue, adopted on 11 September 2015. I am convinced that the resolution will strengthen the Assembly, which is the most representative body of the United Nations.
Climate change, another new threat to international peace and security, is increasingly affecting our ecosystems and the survival of the planet. If we do not act today, the consequences will be devastating — floods in some areas, droughts in others and even breaches of the peace in certain cases. My country notes the relative progress made in the process of negotiations in Bonn. However, I note that just two months before the upcoming twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris, those negotiations are far from attaining any preliminary agreement before we set to work in earnest to conclude an agreement at
the Conference. The gravity of the situation requires that we, leaders of the world, be able to courageously overcome our differences and make every effort to reach agreement in Paris. The climate situation continues to deteriorate.
In the opinion of the experts, the year 2014 was the warmest ever, and everything suggests an increase of 4°C, 5°C or 6°C in global warming if nothing is done today. It is therefore time for us to assume our responsibilities and make the right decisions, the decisions that our peoples expect of us. It is a question of the survival of humankind and the legacy we bequeath to future generations. Africa and South America, which are the two lungs of the planet, have a fundamental role to play in the negotiations. That is why I appeal to the Heads of State and Government of those two regional poles to conduct constant consultations during the Paris negotiations.
It is commonly said that climate change has a close connection with the migration crisis. The fight against climate change will certainly help reduce extreme poverty. The desired solutions involve, among other things, the development of the energy and water sectors, but they must also include increased Government investment in such areas as education and professional training. Africa needs electricity and water. Africa also needs to create jobs to improve the well-being of its populations. Providing responses to the climate change through the development of a new economic model will enable people to remain in their home countries. It is therefore important that the international community mobilize to set up coping mechanisms to mitigate the effects of global warming.
Since the Copenhagen Conference, Gabon has, through me, has continued to call for the adoption of a universal and binding agreement on climate change. The upcoming Paris Conference in December will enable us to achieve that vital objective. To achieve it, we must avoid the mistakes made in Copenhagen. The crucial nature of the Conference is such that it cannot be postponed for another year, because what is at stake is the survival of humankind. If we postpone it, it will be too late.
Over the course of recent decades the world has changed at a fast pace, an evolution that unfortunately is in contrast with the inflexibility of the ideas, institutions, rules and practices that form the framework of global governance. A new architecture whose legitimacy is
founded on the participation of all in the management of the affairs of the world is now necessary. The United Nations must resolutely embark on the path of reform if it wishes to continue to play a strategic and diplomatic role at the highest global level.
Now that democracy is a cardinal value, the organization of world affairs should no longer be based on the precept of balance of power. An international system based on power, whether balanced or coordinated, has the disadvantage of promoting hierarchy and the marginalization of small States and accentuating the absence of reciprocity. On the other hand, multilateralism, of which the United Nations is the guarantor, favours collective security over the balance of power, inclusion over selection.
Seventy years after the establishment of the United Nations, the growing number of its States Members shows that the world has definitely opted for multilateralism. Such intention necessarily involves an innovative political plan based on the principles of equality, inclusion, indivisibility and reciprocity. That is the primary goal of the United Nations. May the Almighty help us to achieve it."
70,2015,HRV,"Allow me to congratulate you on your election, Mr. President, and to thank His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa for his leadership throughout the previous session. We have great expectations for this session, recognizing that there is an urgent need for action on so many issues and in so many areas of the globe. While acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead, we sincerely hope that by working together we can turn those challenges into opportunities and make significant progress in achieving some of our common goals.
As we celebrate the 70 years of the United Nations, I find myself reflecting on the past 23 years, beginning in 1992, when Croatia joined the United Nations and has since gone on to contribute to the Organization’s legacy and achievements for almost a third of its existence. During those 23 years, Croatia has transformed itself from a recipient of United Nations assistance and an item on the Security Council’s agenda into an active member supporting the work of our Organization in many areas. Croatia has served on the Security Council and has held the presidency of the Economic and Social Council, and has actively and substantively contributed to our common cause, whether in peacekeeping missions, peacebuilding efforts, arms control, economic and social development, gender equality, strengthening the international legal architecture, or reforming the General Assembly. The United Nations can rest assured that Croatia will continue its efforts and contributions.
Can we truly say that we are doing enough to ensure peace, security and human rights? Are we doing enough to protect our planet, the only one we have? Member States, all 193 of us, should not forget how important membership is, nor how important are the commitments that we have made to ensuring global peace and security. Strengthening the role of the United Nations and promoting international relations and economic order is in the interest of all nations. That is not an empty phrase, but a reality that we must constantly be mindful of.
We must ask ourselves whether we are currently meeting the expectations that people around the globe have of the United Nations and of us as Members. The answer is obvious, and not flattering. Too many armed conflicts persist, too many people are denied basic human rights, too many children go to sleep
hungry every night, and too many women and girls are left behind. We are witnessing a breakdown in basic governance and increasing economic despair in too many parts of the world, with more than 1 billion children worldwide living in poverty. It is heartbreaking just to read the number of children who, according to UNICEF, die each day as the result of poverty — 22,000. This is where a commitment to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (resolution 70/1) is not just necessary, but perhaps overdue. I was inspired by the spirit of our Summit last week and hope that it will materialize swiftly and purposefully into actions and accomplishments.
We live in a world so rich with potential and beauty, natural and man-made alike, and yet we have witnessed one atrocity after another. This year marks numerous tragic anniversaries, among which we note the one hundredth anniversary of the unspeakable Armenian tragedy, the seventieth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and the twentieth anniversary of the genocide at Srebrenica. With regard to anniversaries, we should ask ourselves whether they are personal events intended only for the victims and the survivors, or whether they are general reminders designed to alert all of us to how much we have forgotten since our initial attempt to maintain world peace.
Accountability should always be at the centre of our actions. The fight against impunity for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide is not only a matter of justice. It is an equally important element of conflict prevention. No crime should go unpunished, and the effective prosecution of those responsible has to be ensured. We should spare no effort to put an end to the culture of impunity. Croatia is a strong supporter of the International Criminal Court. As the victim of aggression in the 1990s, we are proud to be the thirteenth State to ratify the Kampala amendments on the crime of aggression.
Nearly everything can be prevented. Time will, as always, determine who was right and who was wrong, but is that the only alternative to hindsight? Too often, we have to deal with the consequences of our inaction. Too often, instead of solving problems at their source and addressing the root causes at an early stage, we are required to spend more time and resources on the crises after allowing them to spin out of control. That is because we ignored the early signs or we just did not have the time or the courage to get involved. We must change that approach. We must act in time, with
15-29562 9/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
determination and adequate resources. That is not only the right thing to do. It is smart thing to do. The migrant crisis, which has flooded numerous European States, is a textbook case of paying too high a price as a consequence of inaction.
The challenge of migration is nothing new. It has been a part of human existence since the dawn of humankind. However, with 60 million people on the move worldwide, what is new is the lack of clear guidelines and comprehensive policies. We need sound legal, social, economic, humanitarian and logistical solutions. The current migrant and refugee problem has national, regional and global aspects. It cannot be addressed — yet alone solved — by one State alone. It is a multidimensional problem that requires multilateral solutions, in terms of protection against terrorism, preventive diplomacy and sound development. Whoever wants to avoid that issue, or pretend that it does not exist, will simply not be able to help solve it.
Since mid-September, with almost 80,000 people having entered Croatia, my country has joined a list of European Union and neighbouring South-East European countries that have been heavily burdened by the current crisis. Croatia has to look at that issue from its own perspective, while keeping in mind historical, current and future global policy trends. And finding the right balance of national, regional and global considerations is the hardest task. We must focus on both micro and macro levels at the same time, while keeping in mind what is really at stake: human lives and the future of so many individuals and their families. Here, I ask for consensus within the European Union. Here, I ask for a global response. Here, I ask that we focus on the rule of law and the conventions that we signed at the end of the Second World War.
The solution to the migrant crisis in Europe will have to be addressed at the highest global level in several ways. It is an issue that involves ways of defending against terrorism, which, together with extremism in all its forms, must be prevented and defeated at its core. But it is also an issue that involves providing sufficient financial and material aid to refugee camps in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and elsewhere in that part of the world. And equally important, it is an issue of efficiently policing and administering international borders. Last but not least, it is an issue that involves combating those who profit from human trafficking and eliminating their networks.
The first thing that always comes to mind is educating our children, our future generations, working harder at achieving global citizenship and building on the United Nations idea of a global classroom, such as the Global Education Initiative, in which Croatia is proud to serve as a champion country. It is important to establish a curriculum on common standards for global citizenship, a curriculum that should become compulsory for all children in their formative years. We need to deliver on the promise of the right to education.
It seems clear that legislation is not enough. We need a change of mindset and behaviour, and that is only possible through education. We must promote education that instils tolerance, trust, compassion, integrity, truth and respect for the dignity of the individual and gender equality. Children are not born with hatred, intolerance, racism, sexism, prejudice or stereotypes in their hearts and minds. They have much to teach us.
The rostrum in front of me bears the logo which 70 years ago became a symbol, not just of the United Nations, but of the better world that we then envisioned for ourselves. Since that time, progress has been achieved in some areas, while there have been alarming developments in others. I am hopeful that our quest for a better, safer and more prosperous world is far from over.
To take one example of the dangers we face, the impact of climate change and global warming on the economy, development, security, political stability and human rights of all countries can no longer be ignored. As we can see for ourselves, the United Nations logo shows the world from the perspective of the Arctic Circle and, sadly, last year’s winter was one of the warmest ever. As the Arctic ice melts and the oceans grow warmer, do we truly grasp the full impact that that has already had on our planet?
We cannot predict the final impact that those changes will have. All over the world, and in Croatia as well, we are recording changes in sea temperature and have witnessed unprecedented changes in the ecosystem. In Croatia’s beautiful Adriatic Sea, we have begun documenting the arrival of new species of fish from tropical waters. That represents a trend that many other countries are witnessing, and there has to be a joint solution on that front. With sea levels rising, many coastal States, like Croatia, will be seriously affected, while the even greater impact that some of our fellow
10/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
Member States may face will be detrimental to their very existence.
It is vital that our actions deal with the interrelationship between climate change, natural resources, prosperity and security. We have to fully understand how those interactions will affect our future prosperity, stability and development. In that regard, we must realize how fragile life is on this planet and that the damage that we have done may not be reversible. We must learn how to change our behaviour and to show more respect for our planet.
The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a chance that we cannot afford to miss. We should collectively take pride in the fact that we did not miss the chance presented by the Third International Conference on Financing for Development at Addis Ababa. We must remain committed to finding and executing the effective means of implementation for our ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and follow the Addis Ababa Action Agenda to the fullest extent.
Unfortunately, the world continues to be appalled by the brutality of a multitude of violent acts and to face increasingly complex security threats involving non-State actors. In this context of evolving security challenges, the rise of terrorism presents a threat to all of us and calls for a well-coordinated response. Croatia welcomes the work of the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations and its review of United Nations peacekeeping operations. We hope that its report will provide future guidance for increasing the effectiveness of United Nations peace operations as one of the key mechanisms for ensuring global peace and stability.
In implementing the mandates of peace operations, we stress the importance of giving the highest priority to the protection of civilians, the prevention of atrocities, especially sexual and gender-based violence, and the protection of children. In addition, I would like to welcome efforts made in other review processes, namely the review of the peacebuilding architecture and the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). I am truly confident that all expert recommendations will find a way to be implemented.
We are witnessing fragile peace and security situations in many parts of the world. Under such circumstances, our dedication to security agreements is becoming increasingly important. This is why we
regret that the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons did not produce the much-needed results. Croatia believes that this Treaty continues to be the most effective multilateral instrument for preventing nuclear proliferation and achieving nuclear disarmament. We should therefore spare no effort to uphold and enhance the Treaty in the future.
The uncontrolled spread of conventional weapons represents another significant threat to security and stability. In that respect, Croatia was proud to preside over the first Review Conference of the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which is among the most insidious types of weapons because they continue to be a threat long after a conflict ends. It is no coincidence that the Conference took place in Dubrovnik, a city that suffered attacks from these kinds of weapons in the Homeland War.
As a country with a rich historical heritage with seven UNESCO world heritage sites, Croatia strongly condemns the deliberate destruction of the world’s cultural history and urges the United Nations and everyone to do more to protect and safeguard heritage in areas where it is threatened by conflicts and extremists.
In terms of diplomacy and foreign relations, this year could mark a turning point in bilateral relations and a shift towards global policy. In this regard, I cannot overemphasize the importance of trust, not just trust among Member States and international institutions, but trust and truth at every level.
On the positive side, we are pleased to note the positive outcome of the negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme. We congratulate the parties to the talks on their determination and political will to resolve an issue that has been burdening international relations for so long. This is a major victory for diplomacy. We expect in the coming months to see to what extent the removal of the nuclear threat is contributing to the vitally important question of the stabilization of the Middle East and beyond.
Another milestone in international security has been achieved with the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty. This legally binding instrument establishes for the first time minimum standards in the trade of conventional arms at a global level. Croatia is proud to be among the countries that have ratified and put into effect this milestone treaty.
15-29562 11/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
Croatia is fully committed to promoting peace and stability globally, but even more so regionally. We host the Regional Arms Control Verification and Implementation Assistance Centre, an organization with the important mission of fostering dialogue and cooperation on security matters in South-East Europe, with a focus on harmonizing norms and standards, thus facilitating rapprochement with the European Union and NATO.
The issue of most pressing concern is related to the challenges in Europe, in particular its southern neighbourhood. The challenge of the migrant crisis has somehow triggered a connection between geography and peoples’ destinies and has brought to the fore the tragic consequences of unresolved conflicts. As to Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen and the other crisis areas of the Middle East and North Africa, we share a grave concern about the continuing and growing trend of violence, religious intolerance and terrorist actions. In those countries, we see unspeakable acts of barbarism and terror with such appalling forms of killing as beheadings, we see sexual violence against women and girls and other extremely heinous crimes — against humanity, culture, religion, dignity and, most appalling of all, human life. It is shocking and sickening. It has nothing to do with Islam, a religion of peace, tolerance and understanding.
We urgently need to stand together, face this huge challenge and mobilize all our efforts to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and all forms of intolerance and discrimination. At the same time, we have to find prospects for a peaceful resolution of these conflicts and pave the way for a better life. It is not enough to end human suffering; it is just as important to provide hope and opportunities.
We need to build safe, tolerant and flexible communities that are resistant to radicalization and the marginalization of certain social groups, particularly the most vulnerable ones. To that end, we must expand economic, educational and other opportunities. By so doing, we will eliminate the preconditions for radicalization and violent extremism, which may lead to terrorism. In this regard, we call for the timely implementation of the newly adopted Sustainable Development Goals.
There is no development without security. And there is no real security without justice, human rights, rule of law and good governance. Sustainable development
rests upon economic, social and environmental pillars and the positive synergy between them. There are few straight lines leading to the final goal; rather, it is a meticulous task that requires connecting all the dots, big and small. The complexity of the 2030 Agenda is testimony to that fact. However, it is the only way forward if we are truly committed to leaving no one behind.
On the European continent, in Ukraine, the implementation and the viability of the peace process have to be ensured. The ceasefire must be respected and the Minsk peace plan adhered to by all parties. Croatia, together with its partners in the European Union, remains committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as to assisting and supporting Ukraine on its reformist path towards a peaceful and prosperous future.
We emphasize the importance of the stability of South-East Europe and its prosperity. Croatia remains strongly committed to doing its utmost to support the processes of the Euro-Atlantic integration of its south- eastern neighbourhood. We strongly believe that this is the most efficient and constructive way to secure peace, stability and prosperity for this part of Europe. In particular, as we approach the twentieth anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords, we all should support Bosnia and Herzegovina, a politically emancipated State in which decisions are taken for the equal benefit and prosperity of its three constituent peoples and other communities and individuals.
History is more often than not the real litmus test for leadership. The attribute that all great leaders have had in common is the ability to see past the boundaries of their own timidity. That has often been called vision, or perhaps foresight. In any case, I believe that we all of us fail when we are forced to make a distinction between friends or allies and adversaries. Drawing those distinctions and picking sides creates another wall in terms of global policy. It not only blocks vision, but it confines reason. And once that line is crossed, history teaches us that conflict is inevitable. In terms of all the current crises, I have to say that the traditional bilateral diplomacy should be reevaluated in the light of shifting global policy.
Never judge a country, person or problem by its size. Do not look at numbers and do not be limited by vocabulary, legal terms, boundaries or borders. In terms of size, Croatia ranks 124th in the world, but
12/54 15-29562

we are determined that our international presence and relevance will be far greater than our size. Our geographical location keeps us at the global table, sometimes against our will, but mostly by choice. I, for one, am not going anywhere and will continue to ask real questions. More and more leaders must realize, as I have from the start, that we should, all of us, look on solidarity and membership in multilateral and international organizations as a privilege for our citizens. When we leave New York and return home, we need to evaluate our national and international interests and values. We should talk to friendly States and to adversaries. We should engage in dialogue, ask real questions, build trust and keep our perspective. We, the peoples of the United Nations, have the tools and the means. Now is the time to find the will to use them.
"
70,2015,TGO,"Before I begin, Sir, allow me to express my warmest congratulations to my friend John Dramani Mahama, President of the Republic of Ghana, for his excellent statement.
I am pleased to address the Assembly as we embark upon a new phase in our long search for peace, security, development and shared prosperity. At the outset, allow me to express my warm congratulations to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I would also like to reiterate our full appreciation for the positive efforts that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has undertaken since assuming his post.
Ever since its founding, our Organization has fully engaged with States, regional organizations and citizens to promote peace and security and to progressively raise standards of living. I therefore salute the long path we have travelled together.
Since becoming a Member of the Organization, on 20 September 1960, my country has made the values and priorities at the heart of the United Nations its own. Togo has striven with great determination to contribute to the triumph of the noble ideals of our Organization. In return, Togo has also received a great deal from the family of the United Nations. The most recent example of that fruitful cooperation goes back to the presidential election of 25 April. We will not forget that, throughout the electoral process, Togo benefited from the multidimensional support and attentive interest of its friends and partners, in particular the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations
15-29562 21/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
Office for West Africa. That solidarity was a source of encouragement to us and provided added impetus for us to make the extra effort that the Togolese people expected of us in order to succeed in the holding of the election. I would like to take this opportunity to express the deep gratitude of the Togolese people for that support.
Today, the Togolese people intend to build fully on that success, thanks in particular to our political reforms, which seek to further strengthen democracy and our ability to work together in the pursuit of progress. In that regard, fully aware of the stakes involved in ensuring peace and security in a just and fair society, Togo plans to make economic and social inclusion the priority in its strategy of national unity. The priority of priorities for Togo is to advance in consolidating the well-being of all its citizens, and thereby be able to play a more active role in the realization of our new post- 2015 development agenda.
Our national priorities for the coming years essentially dovetail with our new commitments under the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its SDGs (resolution 70/1) requires us to do a much better job than we were able to do in the past with the Millennium Development Goals. Even if we did not succeed in achieving all of those Goals within the agreed timetable, today we at least have the benefit of the experience, mistakes and successes of the past, which represent a huge capital on which to draw in order to better address the challenges before us.
At a time when we are deliberating the future of international cooperation, I think that it is crucial for us not to forget the high price that we have just paid in tackling the Ebola virus. Since I was supervising the fight against that disease in the Economic Community of West African States — the epicentre of the outbreaks of that virus — I would like to take this opportunity to express our profound gratitude to the States, regional organizations, bilateral and multilateral partners and non-governmental organizations that mobilized significant resources and assisted the countries most affected in various ways to stem the epidemic. I would also like to salute the heroism of the health-care personnel of various nationalities and communities who never abdicated their responsibilities, even when their lives were in danger. They saved lives and demonstrated our capacity to respond to extreme situations.
Finally, I would to express my sincere condolences for all of those who gave their lives in attempting to save the lives of others. Ebola has claimed lives, destroyed communities and weakened economies. It is responsible for losses of approximately $2 billion in gross domestic product in the three countries affected. Today, Ebola has been weakened but has not been completely conquered. We must all remain vigilant, not only to eradicate the residual hotbeds of that disease but also to rebuild systems that are more resilient to the vulnerabilities and shocks to which we remain exposed. Such crises must not, however, prevent us from staying the course or from keeping our promises to achieve economic growth and social progress. I urge all of our partners to remain active and committed, including those in countries that have so far been spared.
While we can be pleased with the fact that economic growth in Africa has been among the highest in the world in recent years, we must nevertheless note that, at the current pace, Africa will not be able to provide a massive number of jobs for its young people, nor to significantly reduce poverty. The need for accelerated, inclusive economic growth requires structured actions and financing that go far beyond our traditional, financial architecture. For that reason, Togo hopes that, following the Addis Ababa Conference on Financing for Development, the community of donors will spare no effort to assist African countries, more constructively and with fewer restrictions, in their quest to diversify sources of financing and to expand their domestic budgetary space.
In the same vein, at a time when we are seeking more appropriate mechanisms for financing development in Africa, it would be regrettable if cultural values that form the bedrock of African societies were sacrificed. That could jeopardize the results that have already been achieved. In that regard, pressure should no longer be brought to bear on our States to force them to adopt programmes and initiatives that would lead to cultural shocks. As the bishops of Africa said in their common declaration in June, we are concerned by the fact that aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals that are linked to sexual and reproductive health could be made the conditionalities for the granting of resources, as the endorsement of such issues continues to be highly controversial in African societies.
The long and rich experience of the United Nations teaches us that peace and security are at the same time preconditions and elements of development.
22/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
That dual requirement must be fully taken into account in the strategies that we will have to develop to effectively implement the SDGs. Togo, whose economy is largely dependent upon the West African hinterland, knows the true value of security in the African subregion. Combating the terrorist group Boko Haram and all forms of extremism and racism must continue relentlessly, with the help of the international community and in line with the values promoted by the United Nations. The shifts in power in that regard that we have been seeing throughout Africa in recent years do not correspond to any of the fundamental values of our continent. Togo expects to capitalize on what has been achieved through the reform of its defence and security system in order to better tackle new challenges and threats. We can never stress enough how crucial it is to align our policies in the areas of security, the defence of human rights and environmental protection. The environmental dimension of crises and conflicts, the impact of climate change in exacerbating poverty and the repeated threats to human rights during times of war are realities that we cannot conceal if we want to preserve stability in our States over the long term. That is why the Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris in December will be the first test of whether or not the sustainable commitments we have just made are sound.
Given the importance of what is at stake, it falls to us to adopt a binding international agreement at that Conference that will improve the lives of millions of people throughout the world by taking the necessary measures to keep climate change below the threshold of a 2°C rise in temperature. In Togo, unfortunately, we are already experiencing the effects of climate change every day, including coastal erosion, which amounts to a 10 to 12 metres annual advance of the sea, threatening our coastal populations. There are therefore immediate risks for the survival of those populations that require more urgent responses and significant investments. It is therefore crucial that future international financing aimed at combating the effects of climate change, and specifically financing that will make its way into the Green Fund, not come through a reduction in traditional official development assistance.
I would like to take this opportunity to recall that the economic, security and environmental challenges connected with the seas and oceans will be addressed during the African Union Extraordinary Summit on Maritime Security and Safety and Development in
Africa, which Togo will have the privilege of hosting next year. At that Summit, we hope to be able to adopt effective measures and make decisions that will enable us to work together so that the oceans and seas remain a major asset for the development of Africa.
After 70 years of peacekeeping operations, we must acknowledge that such operations are no longer sufficient to ensure the effectiveness of our actions when faced with the changing nature of crises and conflicts. It is for that reason that we must constantly innovate in order to adapt our responses to the current security challenges. In that regard, my country, which has always participated in peacekeeping missions, welcomes the report (A/70/95) of the High-level Independent Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, which was established by the Secretary-General to assess peacekeeping operations. Its recommendations should receive our full attention. My country also welcomes the holding, two days ago, of the summit meeting on peacekeeping operations, organized by a group of States at the initiative of the United States of America. That meeting sought to make more resources available for peacekeeping operations.
The magnitude of the challenges we are facing today requires that we constantly renew our commitment to the original purposes of the United Nations. It is our duty to preserve, in times of war and in times of peace, human dignity and to build a world based on the promotion and protection of human rights.
In that regard, I would like to pay well-deserved tribute to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which recently closed its office in Togo after having helped the Government, national institutions and civil society strengthen their capacities in the area of the protection and promotion of human rights. The eight years of cooperation that have just come to an end enabled Togo to make significant progress in the area of human rights. We intend to relentlessly pursue our efforts in that area, because we are firmly convinced that a society in which the rights of the individual are protected and guaranteed has all the cards it needs to achieve its promises of development and prosperity. It is my strong desire that the multifaceted cooperation that has mobilized us in the great United Nations family can continue to be strengthened in all the areas in which it can enable human beings to progress more easily in solidarity and in sharing.
15-29562 23/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
With that, I wish a happy birthday to the United Nations, our common Organization, and renew my wishes for success in its future actions. Above all, I express the hope that the years to come can give us an opportunity to preserve and strengthen our collective commitment to the ideals of peace, security and sustainable development.
"
70,2015,SWE,"Sixty years ago, Secretary- General Dag Hammarskjöld said these simple words, which summarize our task here today:
“The United Nations is an expression of our will to find a synthesis between the nation and the world ... to serve the world by serving our nation, and to serve our nation by serving the world.”
We will never forget Dag Hammarskjöld’s life, and we welcome the new resolution 69/246, investigating his death, but now more than ever, we need to ensure that his idea of international solidarity lives on.
The current refugee situation is a global crisis, a global responsibility and now also a global crisis of responsibility. The United Nations system and all the world’s leaders need to come together to ensure that those fleeing war and repression are treated in a safe, orderly and dignified way. We should dramatically increase the number of resettlement places, expand legal avenues for migration and base all our efforts on the principle of non-refusement and the right to seek asylum. It is extremely urgent that all the countries of the European Union treat people seeking refuge in the Union with a spirit of humanity, solidarity and shared responsibility.
Sweden will do its share. We are the largest per capita receiver of asylum seekers in Europe and we are increasing our funding to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is in dire need of more resources. But that is something no country or continent can tackle alone. It is time for us all to step up to solve this crisis. It is not simply our task. It is our duty in the service of our nations and the world.
To solve the current crisis, we also need to stop the horrors in Syria. Extrajudicial executions, sexual and gender violence, and atrocities that may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity cannot be tolerated by the international community. Sweden supports the efforts to secure humanitarian assistance for the Syrian people. We stand behind Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura and his proposal to form working groups with Syrian participation to implement the Geneva communiqué (S/2012/523, annex). To support that process, we want to see an international contact group comprising key international and regional actors. And time is of the essence. The Security Council and its major Powers must shoulder their responsibility. The bloodbath must end.
Meanwhile, other conflicts cannot be forgotten. A seven-year-old child in Gaza has already lived through three wars. Peace talks need to be resumed so that the State of Israel can live alongside a democratic, coherent and viable Palestinian State. Sweden has recognized the State of Palestine. We want to see a more equal relationship that will pave the way for the two-State solution that Israelis, Palestinians and a broad international community view as the right path to peace. Sweden will also step up its efforts to promote peacekeeping and crisis management.
We are contributing civilian personnel to missions in South Sudan, Afghanistan, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Middle East, and we have sent military personnel to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and the Global Coalition to Combat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. We stand ready to contribute to future United Nations missions and are continuing research on developed doctrines and methods for peacekeeping to share within the United Nations.
Working to maintain peace also means following through on our mutual promises of disarmament,
15-29562 37/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
namely, to pursue legal, practical and technical solutions to fully rid our world of its remaining 16,000 nuclear weapons; to finally destroy what remains of other inhumane arms, such as biological and chemical weapons; to implement the Arms Trade Treaty; and to fight the spread of small arms and light weapons, including ammunition. If we sway from those goals, humankind will suffer for our faults.
If peace is more than the absence of war, peacebuilding is more than the direct prevention of military conflict. Lack of resources, rising sea levels and natural disasters have already wreaked havoc on women and men living in vulnerable States. Climate change can work as a conflict multiplier, threatening peace as well as our chances to achieve all our Sustainable Development Goals. We need a course of action to create a low-carbon and climate-resilient world economy. We must protect land and ocean ecosystems. That is not a choice; it is a necessity for our survival.
The world must therefore reach a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement in Paris in December that, over time, will hold the rise in global temperature below 2°C, to the extent possible. Sweden will play its part by becoming one of the first fossil-free welfare nations in the world and having no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. We will be strong financial supporters of the Green Climate Fund and international climate action, with a view to supporting adaptation and transfer of technology on a global scale.
The coming decade will also need to see major investments in the schooling, higher education and professional training of our youth. We need fair and equal societies, where the just contributions of those who have are used to finance the gift of knowledge and power to those who have not. That is a foundation for peace that is too precious to neglect. Moreover, it is closely connected to the potential of gender equality. Barring women from power, public debate, work and education and depriving them of their human right to decide for themselves, including control over their own bodies, reproduction and sexuality — all that is a global disgrace.
It is time once and for all to get rid of structures that discriminate against and belittle people, on whatever grounds. It is time to fully realize Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), granting women their crucial role in peace and State-building. It is time to see sexual violence as one of the most destructive weapons of all
and to fight it with the full force of the international community.
New times also demand a new mindset. As several leaders of island countries have told me: “We are not a small island nation; we are a large ocean State”. To fully grasp the potential of the new world economy, we need to remove old colonial prejudice and false conceptions of large and small, North and South, East and West. We should welcome and enhance the transformation and expansion of the global economy through free and fair trade and create a global deal for decent work, while working to free some 160 million child labourers and also to end modern slavery. Sweden is taking concrete measures to maintain political support at the highest level for our common 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), and we will continue to allocate 0.1 per cent of our gross national income to official development assistance.
For me, words that are not followed by actions are not worth being spoken, but the challenges for the international community also show the dire need for a strengthened and reformed United Nations. Sweden contributes resources, but we also want to contribute reforms. We want to make the United Nations more effective, transparent and fit-for-purpose. We will work to strengthen cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations, not least the African Union.
In 2017, it will have been 20 years since Sweden last held a seat on the Security Council. Over the years, we have stood by those fighting for independence and dignity and against repression, colonialism, apartheid and inequality. We now seek Members’ confidence to champion the perspective of small and medium-sized States as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. We will strive tirelessly for a Council that can respond swiftly to the security challenges of our time and that is more representative, transparent and effective. A reformed Council must reflect today’s realities, with adequate representation for Africa, Asia and Latin America. We also support efforts to limit the use of the veto.
Although we see distress, we also see hope. The agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue was indeed a victory for the idea of diplomacy. Shared efforts create shared progress. Our decision on the new Sustainable Development Goals will, if thoroughly implemented, enable us to create another landmark in human history. And the upcoming Climate Change Summit in Paris
38/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
will give us the opportunity to act — late, but hopefully not too late.
Sweden is fully committed to those tasks. We believe that international solidarity is the first and foremost foundation for shared peace and prosperity. International cooperation is the only way to transform solidarity into substantial change. This year must be the essential milestone for global development and for future generations. So let us create that milestone, serving our nations and serving our world.
"
70,2015,VUT,"Vanuatu is honoured to join previous speakers in congratulating the President on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session, and I would like to assure him of my delegation’s full support. Under his leadership we are confident that he will guide us successfully through the session. I would also like to offer warm thanks to the previous President of the Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa. His exemplary leadership has produced many important achievements that will continue to shape and strengthen the United Nations and enable it to execute its mandate effectively.
We are meeting today at a critical crossroads in history that presents us with a unique opportunity to change the lives of millions of people around the world, especially the most disadvantaged, for the better. The 2008 world financial crisis dramatically changed the global financial landscape. The banking crisis resulted in unprecedented unemployment and low economic growth around the world. The effects of the financial crisis are still being felt, and the recent volatility of the global financial markets has created further uncertainty.
Apart from that global economic challenge, we are witnessing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis caused by conflict and violence. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are currently more than 60 million refugees in the world, a number unequalled since the Second World
15-29568 29/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
War. Climate change continues to be a major challenge for the world generally, and a major threat to small island developing States (SIDS) in particular. Its impact cannot be understated. The rise in sea levels and the effects of El Niño and unfavourable weather conditions point to a bleak future for humankind.
The uncertain global economic outlook, the adverse impact of climate change and the humanitarian crisis mean that the task ahead of us in implementing the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) is all the more daunting. That stark reality calls for immediate collective action. If we do not resolve this global crisis today, we run the risk of creating a world with no prospect of sustaining peace and security. For the world community, that blunt reality calls for global action to ensure that peace, prosperity and security can continue to be maintained in the future. That is the most important gift we can give our future generations.
I welcome the theme of the General Assembly’s seventieth session, “The United Nations at 70 — the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”. It is timely and relevant to our current global development challenges. Peace, security and human rights are the mutually reinforcing pillars of successful sustainable development and consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. This year we are celebrating the 70 years of the existence of the United Nations, and on reflection, we can see that much has been achieved. We have experienced no major wars so far; millions have been lifted out of extreme poverty and remarkable progress has been made on the human rights front. Despite those achievements, however, significant challenges remain ahead.
The humanitarian crisis that has resulted from the conflict and violence of recent years has revealed a dark side of humankind, a world of haves and have-nots. The major Powers must do more to assist the surging refugee population, and I urge the most financially able countries to seriously consider donating to the coordinated Humanitarian Programme Cycle of the United Nations. What we need now is to address the underlying root causes of such conflicts — extreme poverty, hunger, the lack of good governance, a lack of adherence to the rule of law, poor economic growth, rising inequality and youth unemployment. Sustained and inclusive development is therefore extremely important to preserving peace, human rights and stability around the world. I commend the Secretary-
General’s approach to addressing this humanitarian crisis from a human rights perspective.
In the light of these global challenges, the role of preventive diplomacy as a key instrument in the maintenance of peace and security around the world is critical. Women’s role in this area should be enhanced, and we should focus most of our efforts on preventive diplomacy. Vanuatu will always play its part in maintaining international peace and security, and our deployment of peacekeepers to Côte d’Ivoire and Haiti reflects our commitment to that endeavour.
As part of the international community’s response, we have embarked on three important and ambitious global agendas, adopting the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, as well as drafting an agreement on climate change to be concluded in Paris at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) later this year. The 2030 Agenda promises to be transformative, particularly for those at the margins of society. While the Millennium Development Goals contributed immensely to human progress in areas such as gender equality, extreme poverty reduction and improved access to basic social services, there is room for more to be done. The 2030 Agenda covers a wide range of areas that are pertinent to my country’s sustainable development and a good complement to our national sustainable development aspirations.
We welcome the establishment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, on the conservation and sustainable management of oceans and seas. For too long we have observed the decline of the health of the oceans and seas as evidenced in dying coral, a profusion of marine pollution, damaged coastal ecosystems, declining fish stocks and ocean acidification. We recognize the need for a framework within which the implementation of SDG 14 can be progressively assessed, benchmarked and driven forward for the duration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We therefore support mandating the proposed triennial United Nations conference on the oceans and seas as the driver of progress evaluation for SDG 14.
I am delighted to see that a focus on gender remains an integral part of the 2030 Agenda. Achieving gender equality in my country, given our tradition and cultural makeup, continues to be a challenge. However, the political will to continue to advance women’s interests remains steadfast. We have made notable progress
30/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
on women’s access to basic education and health services and their assumption of leadership positions in municipal councils, and today women have better access to basic financial services than ever before. As one of my country’s leaders, I want to see more tangible progress made in the advancement of women and girls and their active participation in national leadership. That can be expedited if more financial resources can be made available for helping my Government to advance gender equality and women’s empowerment.
The success of the 2030 Agenda will depend on access to affordable financial resources and appropriate technology and on substantially improving national capacity. Regarding access to financial resources, the recently adopted Addis Ababa Action Agenda reflects most of the pertinent issues, and it is important for us to implement it swiftly. I join other global leaders in calling on all developed countries to meet their official development assistance (ODA) commitments, as agreed on in the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration. The ODA target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income (GNI), as well as the increased target of 0.2 per cent of GNI to least developed countries (LDCs) by 2020, must be met, for they are crucial to realizing the 2030 Agenda.
Development financing initiatives through South- South cooperation are complementary to this and will remain critical. On that note, 1 would like to take this opportunity to thank the President of China, His Excellency Mr. Xi Jinping, for his recent announcement at the SDG Summit (see A/70/PV.7) that China will provide $2 billion to developing countries. That type of gesture and goodwill demonstrates real action and genuine partnership.
Access to technology is critical to the achievement of sustainable development. I welcome the United Nations initiative, launched in Istanbul, aimed at establishing a technology bank for least developed countries. My Government would greatly appreciate its speedy realization. In the area of technology, and particularly the development of information and communication technologies (ICT), Vanuatu has made tremendous strides in recent years. Our efforts were recognized last weekend when Vanuatu, along with a small number of other countries, received a United Nations award for ICT development, thus demonstrating the transformative role that ICT is playing in improving our people’s lives. It will continue to be a key tool for us in our implementation and achievement of the SDGs.
Regarding improving country capacity, I urge the United Nations to assist developing countries, particularly SIDS and LDCs, in developing their statistical capacities. For small island developing States, that remains a challenge and, as we know, it is the most important basis for formulating evidence-based policy, as well as assessing progress on the 2030 Agenda.
For small island developing States such as Vanuatu, climate change remains a major threat to our achievement of sustainable development. I am therefore grateful to see that Goal 13 of the 2030 Agenda highlights the importance of climate change. However, we should note that this Goal can be meaningful only if we reach a favourable agreement in Paris in December. The connection between climate change and sustainable development is clear. If we do not address climate change, SIDS cannot achieve sustainable development. In March, Vanuatu experienced a category-5 tropical cyclone that affected 60 per cent of the population and 64 per cent of its economy. According to our current assessment, it will take many years and more than $500 million to rebuild our economy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the international community for its swift response in assisting us immediately after the cyclone hit with disaster relief and operations. We look forward to its continued support for our recovery and reconstruction efforts, which we have just embarked on.
Our Pacific island leaders have continued to voice their concerns about climate change in regional and international forums. We are calling for a legally binding agreement limiting the increase in the average global temperature to well below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and for anchoring loss and damage provisions in the agreement. We are also calling for a financial package that will commit countries in the UNFCCC’s annex I category to providing $1 billion a year by 2020 in order to finance our adaptation and mitigation needs. These declarations represent our collective voice in the lead-up to the Paris Climate Change Conference and our call to ensure that the planet is saved for us and future generations.
Apart from focusing on climate change, we have also agreed to strengthen regional connectivity, improve productivity and boost economic growth to ensure peace and security in our region, all initiatives that are consistent with the 2030 Agenda. The relationship between the United Nations and the Pacific-based regional organizations is critical to the implementation
15-29568 31/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
of the 2030 Agenda and the SAMOA Pathway. We welcome the recent adoption of resolution 69/318, on the relationship between the secretariat of the Pacific Islands Forum and the United Nations, and we hope that cooperation can now be translated into concrete action.
My delegation would like to remind the United Nations not to lose sight of decolonization issues, in the light of the emerging challenges that have been presented to us to address collectively. Vanuatu calls on the United Nations family to remain equally focused on finding ways to address this long-overdue issue. The United Nations membership must bring closure to its work on decolonization. The right to self-determination has been a fight endured by many generations. While many have lost their lives in the process, the dream continues for the United Nations and all nations advocating and promoting the democratic principles that still linger in the hearts of many, in the hope that one day their cries will be heard and the promise of a self-determined future delivered. The United Nations must continue the work of the Special Committee on Decolonization in order to maintain a meaningful dialogue on the question of New Caledonia. We thank the Government of France for its cooperation in moving the decolonization process forward. It is therefore important that all parties maintain a dialogue and ensure that all the issues are addressed.
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome President Barack Obama’s recent decision to re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba and reopen diplomatic missions between the two nations. We hope the process will be completed soon with the lifting of the embargo on Cuba.
Like other small Pacific island countries, Vanuatu is a small, open and vulnerable economy. Its openness and small size mean that it is highly vulnerable to external shocks and that opportunities to exploit economies of scale are limited. Despite those challenges, we have been able to record economic growth for the past 10 years. The recent impact of Tropical Cyclone Pam, however, has erased the gains made over that decade. It will take many years to recover, making our efforts to achieve sustainable development somewhat daunting. As a result of this difficulty, my Government recently made a decision to request the United Nations to consider postponing our graduation from LDC status for some years. That will give us ample time to recover fully from the effects of the cyclone and rebuild our economy. I urge the membership of the United Nations
to support our draft resolution on the matter during the Assembly’s seventieth session.
My Government and people will work to mobilize domestic resources and ensure that our institutional capacity is geared to meeting the new development Agenda. Like many other developing countries, we acknowledge that we cannot achieve our sustainable development plans alone, and we therefore call on the international community to help us achieve those goals.
My Government believes that the ongoing tensions between the issues of the freedom of the seas and territorial claims has placed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other relevant international conventions under huge pressure. However, I also believe that States must be willing to cooperate and seek peaceful solutions to any disputes that may have arisen. Umaenupne and Leka islands, commonly known as Matthew and Hunter islands, south of Vanuatu, have been a repository of our cultural heritage since well before the colonial era. As in the other 83 islands, people would use the freedom of the seas to visit their claimed cultural sites. For several decades now, my people have been denied their right to enjoy the freedom of the seas and their claimed territory. I would like to thank and commend the United Nations and the Republic of France for their willingness to hold a dialogue and allow my people their right to visit their claimed territory to perform cultural rituals. The Government of France is to be commended for its important role in advocating for the rights of indigenous peoples in our region and around the world.
I would like to place it on record that Vanuatu has declared the two islands and the water surrounding them a cultural and marine protected area. Cultural visits to the island will be undertaken to revive and empower our indigenous and cultural system. I also wish to put it on record that the Government of Vanuatu will strengthen its ties with its French counterpart in collaborative efforts to ensure that our ocean is safe from terrorism, piracy, climate change and illegal fishing.
In conclusion, the global challenges before us are overwhelming. The global economic uncertainty, the impact of climate change and the unprecedented humanitarian crisis at hand remind us that we need to think differently and adopt innovative approaches to resolve those challenges. We need to deviate from business as usual. That is important especially when implementing the ambitious 2030 Agenda for
32/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the soon to be adopted Paris climate change agreement. What we need are revitalized partnerships, international cooperation and collective wisdom to address those challenges. When we stand together, there is no limit to what we can do together.
"
70,2015,PHL,"On behalf of the Philippine Government, I express our warmest congratulations to the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I assure him of the Philippines’ support of his leadership in charting the course for an energized United Nations about to embark this historic year on an ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), our plan of action for our people, planet and prosperity over the next 15 years.
Let me also commend the President for choosing a theme that echoes the fundamental elements that led to the creation of the United Nations. This theme is also at the core of Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III’s social contract with the Filipino people.
In 1945 when the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco, the 51 founding Members, including the Philippines, envisaged a future of enduring peace, shared prosperity and a new era of collaboration. Seventy years later, we have created a meeting place of the world, an experiment in world governance, and a venue where the universal values of equality, tolerance and human dignity prevail.
The United Nations has become a major forum of nations that guarantees the dignity and worth of every person. It has evolved as the main platform of opportunities to fight ignorance, disease, poverty, injustice and extremism. With all the successes and challenges, praises and pitfalls, the United Nations has not only demonstrated its resilience, but has also affirmed its continuing relevance against the backdrop of complex global issues and emerging regional threats to peace and security. ape
Today, the Philippines renews its steadfast commitment to the cause of peace and sustainable development through key priority areas and national positions ranging from climate change and the rule of law, memberships in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), disarmament and non-proliferation to women, peace and security, migration and human trafficking, peacekeeping and United Nations reform.

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
Two years ago in this very forum (see A/68/PV.22), the Philippines outlined the five pillars that form part of the building blocks for the new framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as follows: first, poverty reduction and social inclusion; secondly, environment sustainability, climate change and disaster risk management; thirdly, accountable, responsive and participatory governance; fourthly, a fair and stable order based on the rule of law; and fifthly, peace and security. During the process of intergovernmental negotiations for the 2030 Agenda, these pillars have guided the Philippines in sharing its experiences in pursuing inclusive growth, on some lessons learned in governance and on the continuing development and security challenges that we face as an emerging economy.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the overall global development architecture need to emphasize strengthening the pillar of resilience. The Philippines knows only too well the urgency of building a climate-resilient economy, being one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world and having experienced, almost two years ago, the devastating impact of super-typhoon Haiyan, the strongest typhoon to have made landfall in recorded history.
Given the new normal of mega disasters, the Philippines will continue to play an active role in tackling the issues of climate change, resiliency and disaster risk reduction and management. The Philippines is the current President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum and will promote a meaningful outcome at the twenty- first session of the Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris. The international community must adopt a new, legally binding climate agreement that is universal and equitable, that ensures a bright and low-carbon future for the next generation, and that addresses the needs of vulnerable States and sectors, particularly the poor, women, migrants and indigenous peoples.
On disaster risk reduction and management, the Philippines will be guided by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which recognizes that the State has the primary role in disaster risk reduction and management. That responsibility, however, should be shared with local Government, the private sector and other stakeholders. We will support initiatives in the United Nations that will allow us to work on the four priorities of understanding disaster risk, strengthening risk governance to manage disaster
risk, investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience, and building back better.
On maritime disputes in the South China Sea, the Philippines has long placed its faith in the rules and institutions that the international community has created to regulate relations among States. International law serves as the great equalizer among States, allowing small countries to stand on an equal footing with wealthier, more powerful States. International law is the tie that binds the community of nations together. Without it, the global order could fall into anarchy. That is why the Philippines, under the administration of President Benigno S. Aquino III, has been a strong advocate of the primacy of the rule of law. With the growing support of the international community in peacefully resolving disputes in the South China Sea, including through arbitration, the Philippines believes that the final outcome of this arbitration process would pave the way for a settlement of the maritime disputes.
On our dispute with China, a long-time partner and neighbour, we also hope that we will finally see actions that are consistent with Beijing’s declarations so that genuine efforts to lower tensions in the South China Sea can succeed and the peaceful settlement of disputes can be obtained.
This year, the Philippines plays host to APEC 2015 under the theme: “Building inclusive economies, building a better world”. As APEC Chair for the second time since 1996, the Philippines seeks to mainstream and pursue the following priorities: investing in human capital development; fostering small and medium enterprises’ participation in regional and global markets; building sustainable and resilient communities; and enhancing the regional economic integration agenda. APEC, both as a process and a platform, continues to positively contribute to the region’s economic environment by promoting legal certainty for trade and investment. APEC also complements global efforts to address challenges to sustainable economic growth through the APEC Strategy for Strengthening Quality Growth, which promotes synergy between APEC’s work and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
With respect to ASEAN, the 10 member States will be integrating their economies by the end of this year, realizing the vision of one ASEAN community. We need to ensure that ASEAN and its member States, partners and secretariat remain fully engaged in the
6/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
United Nations system. Indeed, the partnership between ASEAN and the United Nations has been beneficial to regional peace and stability. As we reaffirmed when ASEAN met with the Secretary-General last Wednesday here in New York, we are confident of the United Nations continued support for ASEAN centrality and its pillars.
Disarmament and non-proliferation have become more compelling issues for the Philippines, given that 10 per cent of our population live and work overseas, many in hot spots in the Middle East and Africa. The Philippines remains firm on its position in favour of the total and complete elimination of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. We will continue to voice our concerns over the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons. We reiterate the need for the balanced and immediate implementation of the 64-point action plan adopted at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which was chaired by the Philippines, particularly for the establishment of a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction. We also look forward to the signing and ratification of the Protocol to the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone by the five nuclear-weapon States.
On conventional weapons, the Philippines will help sustain the positive momentum created by the Arms Trade Treaty’s progress and continue to engage in discussions on small arms and light weapons and improvised explosive devices, particularly as used by armed non-State actors.
The Philippines will continue on its path towards successfully implementing the women and peace and security agenda by highlighting at this session the important contributions of women in peace negotiations and peacebuilding, and their roles in shaping the narratives of peace. We will maintain our active role in calling for the continued implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action and the Sustainable Development Goals on women, particularly Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls. Taken together, these instruments are powerful mechanisms for realizing national and international commitments to advancing women’s roles as enablers of sustainable development.
In the negotiations on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Philippines emphasized and will continue to highlight the positive contributions of migrants to sustainable development in countries of origin, transit and destination. We deeply appreciate the United Nations recognition of the Philippines as a model of migration governance because of its comprehensiveness in terms of managed deployment, solid protection, diaspora engagement and reintegration. Both the United Nations and the Philippines believe that migration governance is really about giving migrants a human face. The basic perspective of the Philippine migration management policy focuses on two important considerations: first, migration must be a shared international responsibility; and secondly, migrants’ human rights must be fully respected in all circumstances.
The Philippines will also continue to play an active role on the issue of human trafficking, either as a main or co-sponsor of resolutions that recognize the heightened vulnerability to trafficking of women and girls in humanitarian crisis situations and other emergency environments. The Philippines will work with other Governments to intensify efforts for the speedy disposition of trafficking cases and strengthening of anti-trafficking mechanisms.
Since 1963, the Philippines has been a consistent troop contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations. We are committed to and have answered the call of the United Nations for the deployment of female peacekeepers. I am pleased to announce that there are now 15 Filipino women out of the 161 Filipino peacekeepers in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. Guided by the policy recommendations of the Philippine National Council for United Nations Peace Operations, we will continue to engage with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the deployment of Filipino peacekeepers and support the recommendations of the United Nations High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations to improve the safety and security of our peacekeepers.
At this seventieth session of the General Assembly, the argument for United Nations reform is now more urgent than ever. The Philippines will continue to push for meaningful discussions on enhancing the role and authority of the General Assembly, as well as on proposals to rationalize the agenda of the Assembly and its main committees. The Philippines will support calls for continuing the conversations on the much-needed
15-29822 7/29

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
and long-overdue reforms to make the Security Council more democratic, more inclusive, more transparent and more accountable. These reforms include urging the Council to provide the General Assembly a plural number of candidates, especially women, for appointment to the post of Secretary-General, with due regard to regional rotation and gender equality. Together with other developing countries, the Philippines shares the position that a sufficient budget is important for the Organization to deliver on its mandates and missions more effectively and with greater accountability.
In conclusion, at the fourth session of the General Assembly on 20 September 1949, the late great Philippine statesman, General Carlos P. Romulo, who was just then elected President of the General Assembly, said that the goal of the United Nations
“defined by its Charter, was to make it possible for men to live better lives in larger freedom under a reign of peace founded on justice and universal respect for law” (220th plenary meeting, para. 19).
Those words now bear greater resonance. Today, I have the honour and privilege of leading the Philippine delegation, and on behalf of President Benigno S. Aquino III and the Filipino people, please allow me to convey these solid commitments of the Philippines.
First, as we prepare the way for our future generations the Philippines will continue to advocate for three key priorities and these would be: eradicating poverty; preventing conflict; and promoting the rule of law. Secondly, as we reaffirm our faith in the wisdom of the United Nations founding Members, we renew our commitment to ending the scourge of war, uphold justice and human rights and maintain international peace and security. Thirdly, as we all pursue the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, let the United Nations continue to serve as the institutional platform, the historical foundation and the moral edifice upon which we manifest humanity’s collective dreams, ideals and aspirations.
"
70,2015,IDN,"Let me begin by congratulating Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his assumption of the presidency of the seventieth session of the General Assembly.
It is a great honour for me to stand here and share Indonesia’s perspective on this year’s session of the General Assembly, under the timely theme “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security, and human rights”. On its seventieth anniversary the United Nations has reached quite a ripe age, the same age as the Republic of Indonesia this year. On this occasion I wish to highlight three points: the achievements of the United Nations in the past 70 years, current challenges, and the way forward.
Firstly, the United Nation’s seventieth anniversary is a good moment to look back and reflect on its progress in realizing the ideals of its Charter. The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations has been marked by the adoption of the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I should like to take this opportunity to convey my sincere appreciation to the United Nations
15-29822 3/29

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
Secretary-General for his leadership and steadfastness in the process.
Another success story of the United Nations is certainly its peacekeeping operations which have contributed to maintaining peace and security. Indeed, the United Nations has been relatively successful in preventing and overcoming major global armed conflicts in the past 70 years. Currently, more than 100,000 personnel are involved in 16 ongoing peacekeeping operations worldwide. Indonesia is proud to be the eleventh largest police and troop contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations with more than 2,700 personnel, and yet my country is prepared to contribute more in future.
Meanwhile, the establishment of the Human Rights Council in 2006 has created a peer-based review mechanism which reflects the collective efforts among Member States to strengthen cooperation and dialogue in the promotion and protection of human rights.
Notwithstanding the achievements of the United Nations, we must not be complacent. Indeed, there are still numerous challenges confronting us. As we speak there are still numerous armed conflicts throughout the world. The suffering of the Palestinian people is still taking place, while the realization of a two-State solution is still elusive. The recent conflict in Gaza has caused more than 2,000 human casualties, displacing more than 5,000 people.
Sectarian conflict, including the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), continues to threaten political stability and cause a multitude of humanitarian crises in the Middle East, especially in Syria, Libya, Yemen and elsewhere. Not only have violent conflicts torn countries and nations apart, but in Syria ISIS has also destroyed remnants of a great ancient civilization that is our shared historical legacy.
We ask whether the United Nations has done enough when faced with these unfolding and recurrent tragedies? Radicalism, violent extremism and terrorism continue to pose serious global threats. Indonesia has consistently played its role in addressing these threats, including their underlying root causes, among other ways through interfaith and intercultural dialogue, in sharing best practices in counter-terrorism as well as strengthening international cooperation. Indonesia has also set a successful example in resolving conflict through dialogue and peaceful means. In August, we commemorated the tenth anniversary of the signing
of the Helsinki Memorandum of Understanding on Aceh, which ended about 30 years of armed conflict. We wish to recall, and once again appreciate, the positive contributions of the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) through their monitoring missions.
We note with concern that little progress has been made in the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission. We still lack the necessary political will for nuclear disarmament. Meanwhile, the small arms and light weapons trade, legal or otherwise, is still a multi-billion dollar industry.
We are also witnessing the worst year for human displacement and irregular migration since the Second World War due to political crises, sectarian conflicts and other humanitarian crises globally. In the past weeks, we have seen a flood of refugees fleeing from violence in Syria — where well over 100,000 people have been killed — to seek a safe haven in Europe, despite the dangers and hardships they have to endure on the way. We also ask: does the United Nations have sufficient political will to face these issues?
Meanwhile, economic disparity, poverty and global inequality continue to haunt us. Even today, more than 800 million people throughout the globe are suffering from severe undernourishment. The rich nations, comprising a mere 20 per cent of the world’s population, consume 70 per cent of the world’s resources. In many parts of the world, women, children, young people, persons with disabilities, the elderly and people living in conflict and emergency situations remain marginalized and untouched by the progress in development. Twenty years after the first session of the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, we have yet to produce a universal agreement on climate change.
In the context of trade, we have yet to see progress and concrete results from the Doha development agenda to support a rules-based, open and equitable multilateral trading system. The recent Ebola outbreak has strongly reminded us of the importance of building a strong and resilient health system globally. There are many other problems we are facing that also need to be addressed, such as intolerance, youth unemployment and uncontrolled urbanization. All of these challenges are related to the lack of progress in United Nations reform. Therefore, let us join hands in overcoming these challenges. Here, the role of regional institutions
4/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
such as ASEAN should be be further strengthened in order to complement the United Nations.
We must work together in realizing peace and prosperity for our peoples. We have to stop conflicts and eradicate global inequality. We have to stop the spread of radicalism and violent extremism. We urgently need to realize United Nations reform. With its current membership of 196 compared to 60 in 1950, the United Nations system has to be even more inclusive to better reflect current global geopolitical conditions.
With regard to Palestine, we must ensure the birth of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State.
We must ensure the realization of the SDGs in a timely manner. We hope that the upcoming climate change Conference in Paris will seal the long overdue agreement on climate, applicable to all countries, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2°C.
We urge the United Nations to work more effectively through partnerships with regional mechanisms to better address national and regional challenges. In this regard, ASEAN needs to be even more actively engaged in United Nations processes in seeking better solutions for our global problems. And in narrowing global disparities, we should encourage and support the strengthening of South-South cooperation. In this context, Indonesia will establish the Asian African Centre as a follow-up to the 2015 Asian African Summit aimed at revitalizing the partnership between Asian and African countries to promote peace and prosperity.
Finally, let me conclude by stating that the world today relies on the United Nations: to create world order and peace and equitable prosperity; to guarantee security for the global community; and to fully implement the principles of human rights as enshrined in the United Nations Charter. For that purpose the United Nations needs the support of each and every Member.
"
70,2015,GNQ,"It is a pleasure for me to take the floor before the General Assembly on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, who, due to numerous duties of State, is not able to be here today.
Equatorial Guinea is participating at this session of the General Assembly in a renewed spirit of faith and trust in the relevant role played by the Organization in promoting peace, security and stability among our nations in order to create the basic conditions for the well-being of humankind. Motivated by that trust, my delegation wishes to warmly congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his unanimous election, which reflects the trust that the international community has in the rigour shown by his country in its treatment of international affairs. I am sure that, during his tenure as President of the General Assembly, he will always be able to count on the support and cooperation of the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. We would like also to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, for the commendable work carried out during his term, with the important decisions taken that will trace out the path for the United Nations towards the democratization and revitalization of its institutions, as well as for the
15-29568 25/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
universal scope of its decisions. I would also like to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate Secretary- General Ban Ki Moon for his tireless efforts to face up to the complex challenges facing the Organization. We extend to him our support and cooperation to achieve every success in his endeavours.
Despite the attempts of some to monopolize the United Nations system with their undeclared interests, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has never lost its faith and confidence in the relevant role that the United Nations must play with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security and in the promotion of fundamental human rights to guarantee the overall well-being of humankind. The United Nations is the only world body in which all States must have faith and trust, as is stated in its Charter. All countries are represented according to the principle of sovereign equality among States, including the democratic principle of respect for the majority opinion and for countries’ own decisions.
The events that have occurred in the first quarter century of this century show a degree of weakness in the role of the United Nations when it comes to preventing and eliminating conflicts between States, in the maintenance of international peace and security and in promoting the economic well-being of States. We are concerned at the proliferation of armed conflicts in Africa, Europe and the Middle East, as well as instability caused in countries of the developing world; the progressive advance of of terrorism in various parts of the world; and drug trafficking and uncontrolled immigration caused by those conflicts. All that would suggest that the United Nations has much more to do. Its Members must act in solidarity and according to the purposes and principles of the Charter, which should unite them in their actions.
In our view, the United Nations is not a police force acting to avert conflicts between States. The States Members of the United Nations must submit themselves to the norms of international law, to justice and respect for human rights, as well as strict respect for those standards. Consequently, they must work towards peace, stability and the development of nations. However, today it would appear that the law of the strongest and the most astute prevails, a situation that naturally leads to rebellions, which could lead to terrorist movements.
We believe that the success of the United Nations does not depend on the skill of the President of the General Assembly or of the heads of United Nations organs, or much less does it depend on the intelligence of the Secretary-General. Many of the denunciations made against the actions, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations happen on a daily basis, without those leaders being in the least concerned, because they feel that their interests lie above those of the principles of the United Nations.
The results are before our very eyes: the large number of wars and conflicts that give rise to refugees and concentration camps and the massive migrations of people looking for a place of refuge in countries that have a degree of stability and economic prosperity. The drop in the price of oil and other internationally traded commodities has a negative effect on the economic development of producer countries. That is the result of the pillaging recorded in the countries that have fallen victim to armed conflicts, the natural resources of which are being seized as trophies of war. Certainly, we are reaping the bad fruits of our own negative destructive action, and that is not in line with the aims of the United Nations.
Equatorial Guinea is a small African country that survives thanks to the cautious approach of its Government, the good graces of its people and the cooperation and solidarity of friendly countries. We have suffered attempted invasions by mercenaries, supported by weapons-producing Powers who had no other aim in mind than to take control of our oil resources. Fortunately, however, the preventive and precautionary measures that we took put an end to the schemes of the aggressors. Not satisfied with that aggression, our country is now subject to a systematic campaign of unfounded accusations concerning human rights violations and abject poverty. We are not ashamed to denounce those accusations here, because the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is open to the world and everyone is familiar with our successful achievements in sociopolitical development.
With the programme adopted by the United Nations on the Millennium Development Goals having come to an end, Equatorial Guinea is pleased to have achieved greater levels through the implementation of the Goals. Equatorial Guinea’s Development Plan — “Horizon 2020” — sets out the following goals: to build international standards of basic infrastructure in order to improve productivity and speed up economic growth;
26/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
to strengthen human capital and improve the quality of life of our citizens; to build a diversified economy based on four sectors, energy and mining sector, fishing and aquaculture, agriculture and livestock farming, and, finally, the service sector; and to establish quality governance at the service of the citizen. Success thus far in the implementation of that programme made it possible for us to achieve the priority Millennium Development Goals.
With regard to the reform of the organs of the United Nations, Equatorial Guinea reaffirms its firm commitment to the African Union position, based on the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, consisting in the demand for two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats on the Security Council, with all the obligations, rights and privileges that those seats entail.
We would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Governments of the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba for the restoration of diplomatic relations. We ask that this culminates in the lifting of the embargo against Cuba.
With regard to climate change, Equatorial Guinea fully shares the concern of the rest of the international community, namely, that the very existence of planet Earth is under threat. In order to combat this everyone should contribute according to their abilities to arrest this phenomenon. That being the case, the Amazon area, in South America, and the Congo Basin, in Central Africa, which constitute the world’s lungs for the preservation of the environment and biodiversity, deserve special attention at the upcoming twenty-first session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris.
I would like to conclude by expressing our wholehearted willingness as a State Member of the United Nations to contribute to all processes that would help to improve the functioning of this world Organization. We wish this session of the General Assembly every success.
"
70,2015,VEN,"We are assembled here in 2015, once again fully aware of the immense struggle of our peoples to arrive at an age of dignity, a time when there will finally be a world that respects the distinct identities of all our peoples, This year, Venezuela celebrates the 200th anniversary of a prophetic document written by our liberator, Simón Bolívar. I am speaking of the letter that he wrote 200 years ago in Kingston, Jamaica, a beautiful island of the Caribbean, at the exact moment when the liberation forces began their ascent from the depths of history after hundreds of years of colonial domination of our lands — today Latin America and the Caribbean. The purpose of that letter was to define the nature of their struggles and outline the path they needed to follow. In it, Simón Bolívar defined the elements of a geopolitical vision for the Americas — a non-imperialist, non-colonialist geopolitical vision that, in twenty- first century terms, we might call anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist. Two hundred years ago, he set down the conceptual lines of the geopolitical thesis we continue to support today to address the need to establish a balanced universe and a world with justice and peace for all. For 200 years we have drawn inspiration from that prophetic letter. And, only a few days ago, here in our common home of humankind, Pope Francis renewed Simón Bolívar’s message (see A/70/PV.3), saying that we need a new form of geopolitics, a new approach, a new world, a geopolitical vision based on respect for the different peoples of the world and for their different identities and models; in other words, a policy of coexistence and of peace with justice and
equality. He called for a political approach that rejects the imposition of all forms of hegemony, whether through the threat or use of force, and all attempts at financial, economic, cultural, military and political hegemony.
This year we also celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Those 70 years have sped by, like a fast-forwarded movie, while we undertook the most important search in human history, namely, the search for ways to settle our differences and to build a world that fulfils everyone’s hopes, a world without exclusion or discrimination. Humankind has been able to celebrate some successes in those 70 years.
In 1945, the Charter of the United Nations was written in the aftermath of the Second World War. While the tragedy that destroyed half of the planet and took millions of innocent lives was still fresh in everyone’s mind, humankind came together to write that Charter and, with it, to spell out its dreams. For 70 years, the Preamble of the Charter has continued to announce emphatically that we the peoples of the United Nations are determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Today, in 2015, we the peoples of the world announce that we are ready to save humankind from the scourges of inequality, poverty, looting and exploitation, which are the true causes of all the wars that we have known.
During those 70 years, we witnessed the birth of a dyadic world — aptly named because of the two factions involved — that, in the form of the Cold War and the resulting real and painful wars, left their mark on the second half of the 1940s and the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Later, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, we saw the emergence of a menacing monadic world that claimed that it had a panacea that could cure all our ills and rid us of false ideologies. In the 1990s, in that world, one way of thinking and one economic model were imposed on us. That was the era of neoliberalism, an era that sowed poverty and extreme need, owing to the privatization of the natural resources and economies of peoples of the South. In general, it sowed misery, sickness and unemployment throughout the world.
A dyadic world characterized by confrontation was succeeded by a monadic world, in which an intolerable situation was inflicted upon us. The dawn of the twenty-first century, thanks to God and thanks to the work of the people, saw the rise of a revolutionary elan in the Venezuelan people, who have, in turn, inspired
6/26 15-29437

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17
the constructive revolution of the peoples of the South, in Latin America and in the Caribbean.
In this new century, the time has finally come to build a multipolar world — a multi-centred world; a world without hegemony; a world of equals; a world in which the other’s points of view are respected; a world that acknowledges the weight that should be given to emerging centres of political, economic and cultural power; a world that recognizes the new regionalisms that are gaining in strength in the various parts of the world; a world that ushers in a new era and recognizes the values set down in the inspiring words of the Charter of the United Nations by ensuring that the rights to human dignity, self-determination, independence and life are realized for all peoples.
This multipolar and multi-centred world encompasses major themes. In this Hall, we have listened to the speeches made from this rostrum. Yesterday, we heard the speeches of President Dilma Rousseff, from our brother country, Brazil, and President Barack Obama of the United States of America. We saw President Vladimir Putin shine as one of the most important leaders in the world today. We saw Presidents Xi Jinping, Raúl Castro, Evo Morales Ayma, Rafael Correa, Cristina Fernández. We have followed attentively the discussion of the topics that are the subject of this debate. We have listened to what was said on the issues of war and peace. I believe that today no one in this Hall, or in any other forum, could offer a single word in defence of the unjust wars that have destroyed our brother peoples in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
Today, taking inspiration from the rebelling and clarion voice of the people of Venezuela, we need to acknowledge the tragic errors that were committed when our brother nations were invaded, bombed and waged war on. Today, we should acknowledge that the four wars that the world has seen during the past decade and a half have caused major systems within the United Nations to fail. With regard to the war in Afghanistan, we should ask ourselves and our brothers, the people of Afghanistan: did it bring peace? Did it bring stability? Did it bring life to the people of Afghanistan? Or did it bring more misery, destruction and terrorism? The war in Iraq was inspired by manipulation and lies and had only one goal: to conquer Iraq. It had only one objective: to take Iraq’s oil and natural riches. Twelve years later, can we say that Iraq is a more united, more peace-filled or more stable country? We should say to those who staged the war in Iraq that once again, through war,
they have failed and caused international politics to fail. And Libya? The words that Commandant Hugo Chávez Frías pronounced in this very Hall are fresh in our memory. He warned of the lies used to justify the bombing and conquest of Libya. Whatever political differences one country may have with another’s leadership or Government, it is not entitled, under the Charter of the United Nations or pursuant to any other mandate, to challenge or judge the political authority of that leadership or to overthrow that Government. No one is authorized to do that.
All this is distressing for us. We love the Arab peoples. We admire their ancient culture. We admire the Muslim peoples. Today, it pains me to say what I think is universally acknowledged, that what happened in Libya was a crime. A stable country, which, in its turn, sustained the stability of a score of other North African and African countries, was destroyed. Libya was the founder of the African Union, but what is Libya now? The people of Venezuela are asking if Libya is a more stable country economically and socially? Is it a united country? Is it a country? Is it a country at peace? And who will pay for the crimes in Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan? Who will acknowledge them? And what will happen to Syria? The situation there brings to mind one of those horror films made in Hollywood. The horror in Syria is created by the politics of terror and the terror of war.
With all due modesty and humility, we in Venezuela believe that the United Nations system still has time to prevent a worse tragedy in Syria, a tragedy of even more terrifying and shocking proportions than those that befell Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. Humankind still has time to create a new alliance of peace. We support the proposal put forth by the President of the Russian Federation, Mr. Vladimir Putin, on the creation of a new alliance of peace. Venezuela, as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, will submit another proposal with a view to protecting the people of Syria and putting up a real fight against the groups that, instigated and financed by the West, have been sowing terror, death and destruction. Humankind must lend its support and assistance to Syria for the salvation of the surrounding region.
Our fellow citizens in Europe would be wrong to believe that they can escape the consequences of the humanitarian tragedy in Syria, or to think that mass exoduses of Syrians will not reach their shores and lands, exerting an impact on the entire European civilization.

The United Nations must wake up and react to the tragedy in Syria. We must learn from the resounding and tragic failure of the four wars I just mentioned and initiate, in the Security Council and the United Nations system, the establishment of a new regulatory system prohibiting the use of interventionist methods to cause war, spread terror and bring destruction and death to peoples declared undesirable or unfriendly by world elites.
We must overcome huge challenges in order to achieve peace. I believe that on this there is general consensus, because we have heard even President Obama say that there is no development without peace. We have heard that the philosophy of peace has been gaining ground among major world leaders. Only peace can guarantee the viability of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), a noble plan for making progress towards achieving equality and overcoming poverty. Only peace can guarantee the viability of development in international relations on our planet. There are therefore huge challenges facing the United Nations system.
A new regionalist approach is being developed in Latin America. This is good news for our Latin American and Caribbean region. In recent years, Latin America has rediscovered the path to unity and independence, to unity in diversity and to a common search. Today, in 2015, we can justifiably say here at the United Nations that Latin America has been consolidating the strength of its new communities. At their historic Summit in Havana, the Latin American and Caribbean States declared Latin America a zone of peace. The path of our region is heading in that direction. Subregional bodies, such as Petrocaribe and the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, and powerful subregional bodies that operate collectively, such as the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), have created a new reality on our continent. We still have one armed conflict to settle: the 60-year-old internal war and conflict in Colombia. On behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, we congratulate Colombia on the welcome steps taken by President Juan Manuel Santos Calderón in order to make progress towards a conclusive peace agreement with the guerrillas of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia. Venezuela is betting heavily on the strengthening of the path of peace in Colombia — that Colombia which was the beautiful dream of our Liberator and the fine creation of our liberators.
In addition, Latin America is speaking with one voice. We will demonstrate this once again on 28 October. President Raúl Castro Ruz and our comrade Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla have announced that the issue of the embargo of the United States against Cuba will be discussed by the General Assembly on 28 October. We acknowledge the steps taken in 2015 for the normalization and regularization of relations, based on respect between the Government of President Barack Obama and the Government of President Raúl Castro Ruz, between the United States of America and Cuba.
We say to the United States Government that we look forward to the day when the relations of its Government with all the Governments of Latin America and the Caribbean enjoy the same treatment in terms of dialogue, respect and recognition as Cuba receives today. We are waiting for the United States to turn the page on a history of interventionism and coups d’état, and of attempts to disrupt revolutionary processes, as occurred in Venezuela and with the long hostility towards Cuba, which lasted for 56 years and consisted of the embargo and economic and financial persecution. That history must not be repeated. The financial and economic blockade and the persecution suffered by Cuba must end as soon as possible.
Just as President Jimmy Carter in 1979 signed the agreement to return the sovereignty of the Panama Canal to the Panamanians, we hope that soon the United States will return the Guantanamo Base and territory to the Cuban people, who have historically been its owners.
The good news is possible only because of the perseverance of the Cuban people and their proud and rebellious spirit, which, like the beauty of Cuba, has remained resilient throughout all these years of struggle. It has also been possible, we must admit, because of the courage of President Barack Obama in assuming a new policy towards Cuba.
In the same spirit, we support and echo the appeal of the Latin American and Caribbean nations to the Government of the United Kingdom to decide sooner rather than later that it will sit down and negotiate, in accordance with international law and via peaceful diplomacy and understanding, the right of Argentina to the Malvinas Islands, South Sandwich and the rest of the surrounding islands that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, historically belong to Argentina. It is an appeal made
8/26 15-29437

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17
by the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77 and China, and all who support peaceful diplomacy, dialogue and communication. It is an appeal that must be answered.
Venezuela has been facing significant challenges in recent years in its endeavour to create an eminently Venezuelan social, economic and political model, an endeavour inspired by the doctrine of Liberator Simón Bolívar. It has chosen the human option in the battle that our brother President Evo Morales Ayma referred to yesterday (see A/70/PV.15) and the option that Pope Francis described as eminently humanistic (see A/70/PV.3). Venezuela has opted to build a new society — the socialist society. It is a twenty-first- century socialist revolution that joins such other revolutions of independence in Latin America as those in Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua. Venezuela is on the same path as the historic Cuban revolution and is following the example of Commander Fidel Castro Ruz, President Raúl Castro Ruz and the Cuban people.
Our people have waged a great battle while facing domestic and foreign conspiracies. Recently, we had to deal with major conspiracies and grave attacks. Earlier this year, we had to have a public debate on a threatening executive order issued, on 9 March, by President Barack Obama, which declared Venezuela an unusual and extraordinary threat to the people of the United States. I think that the debate at the Summit of the Americas in Panama in April accurately clarified the real meaning of the thinking underlying the order. The statement of President Obama recognizing that Venezuela was a country of peace and is not and never has been a threat to the United States is a very positive step. However, I must say, as Head of State and Government, it is not enough. The order issued on 9 March must be repealed and annulled, because it is a threat to my homeland and my country. We have initiated talks with the Government of the United States, in the same spirit in which Cuba initiated a respectful dialogue and communication, so that sooner rather than later we can remove the sword of Damocles — the order of 9 March — that hangs above the heads of the Venezuelan people.
This year also, as we reported nationally and internationally, Venezuela had to use peaceful diplomacy to lift the threat of conflicts along our border. I reported, and I do so respectfully now in the General Assembly, a pincer operation aimed at causing conflicts along the borders with Colombia and
with our sister Republic of Guyana. A week ago, we were in Quito, summoned by CELAC and UNASUR, and together with President Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, we were able to define a way of clearing the provocations, threats and attacks by paramilitaries and drug traffickers against Venezuela. That is being done, and I am now able to say that I have strong hopes that we will be able to complete the process and then restore normal working relations and communications with the Government of Colombia.
Similarly, with the new Government of Guyana, there were a number of issues that needed to be resolved within the regional framework. I want to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for answering the call of Venezuela and convening a meeting on Sunday, 27 September, the day of the blood moon and the eclipse. While the blood moon was rising, we met with the President of Guyana, Mr. David Granger. Again, I am glad to say that peaceful diplomacy prevailed and allowed us to successfully take steps in connection with a historical claim that Venezuela has had since 1835.
The Bolivarian Revolution of Venezuela therefore will continue to address the threats and difficult circumstances with Bolivarian peaceful diplomacy, a diplomacy that enables us, by means of dialogue and communication, to resolve the various threats to and problems of the Venezuelan people.
Venezuela is shortly to hold parliamentary elections — the twentieth in 15 years of revolution. In the previous elections, the revolutionary, independent and Bolivarian forces, inspired by our Commander Chávez, won 18 of the victories. We are heading into the parliamentary elections. Everything is prepared once again. Former United States President Jimmy Carter once said that the Venezuelan electoral system was the most transparent and comprehensive electoral system he had ever seen. It will enable our people to express their will in the elections on 6 December.
I urge the world to be very attentive to any attempt to interfere with the political process in Venezuela. Venezuela is willing to continue its course along the active and participatory democratic path. It is the path prescribed by our Constitution and adopted by our people in 1999. It is a path of peace. The Bolivarian people have an eminently democratic, popular and peaceful nature. Therefore, this year we will
15-29437 9/26

A/70/PV.17 29/09/2015
undoubtedly continue to demonstrate and strengthen the independence and dignity that characterize the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
Two hundred years after the prophetic letter in Kingston was written, we wish here to say aloud, forcefully and with dignity, that we endorse the appeal for a different United Nations and a radical reform of the system created 70 years ago. We venture to say, as Bolívar did, that the world needs a new, balanced and respectful geopolitics that strengthens the new regionalism. Most of all, the world needs to listen to the people. We very much hope that, in 15 years’ time, in 2030, when the next cycle of the 2030 Agenda will be drawing to an end — the Agenda to promote equality and life and to eliminate poverty — we will be able to celebrate a new policy of peace, the rebuilding of the towns that have been destroyed by the unfair imperialist wars, and a new regulatory system with which the United Nations can quell attempts to impose hegemony by those who think they have the right to rule other peoples. I very much hope that in 2030 we will be able to build and rebuild this marvellous institution that was born 70 years ago with a dream of peace, which is our dream today. Long live peace!
"
70,2015,PAN,"This is the second year that I have come to the General Assembly as President of Panama, representing a peaceful, healthy and noble people, to whom I send my greetings from this rostrum, as I also greet the rest of the world’s people.
Like the illustrious Panamanian Ricardo J. Alfaro, who took part in the international conference in San Francisco when the Charter of the United Nations was drafted there in 1945, I stand here today to reaffirm our commitment to human rights and international peace and security. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the efforts of the thousands of men and women of this Organization, in particular those who have given their lives to achieve the objectives of the United Nations.
I preside over a Government whose foreign policy is based on dialogue and consensus, as well as on the continuing search for social peace and the common good. That was in evidence during the historic Summit of the Americas that was held in Panama in April, which became the stage for the recent rapprochement between Cuba and the United States of America, both of whose people and Governments we congratulate on taking that important step. We hope that the process of normalizing relations between them will culminate in a fair and just end to the economic blockade of Cuba. It will be a major challenge for Latin America to maintain the spirit of fraternity that prevailed in Panama during the Summit, but we are determined to do so.
I congratulate the Governments of Colombia and Venezuela on the progress achieved in Quito with respect to normalizing relations between them in order to guarantee the well-being of their peoples and to strengthen the unity between them as part of the great
family to which we all belong and within which we are all eager to overcome any differences through dialogue. I reiterate our support for the Colombian peace process and to welcome the agreements recently reached there. We call for that same resolve and determination that the Government of Colombia brought to bear in its peace efforts, which we all supported, to be applied to dismantling the structures for producing drugs, which have introduced such violence to that country and to the countries that serve as conduits for transporting narcotics to the main consumer markets.
In order to ensure the well-being and prosperity of all nations, armed conflicts and territorial disputes must end. We strongly condemn terrorism. It is unacceptable in the twenty-first century for human beings to be burned alive or decapitated on the basis of their faith. The international community needs to close ranks to protect humankind and to promote dialogue and tolerance as the only mechanism for achieving peace. Panama will stand firm in the belief that, together, we can meet such challenges. We call on the great Powers that united more than 70 years ago to bring an end to the Second World War to continue to work with all Member States on a road map to defeat terrorism and to bring lasting peace to all the countries of the world.
Peace depends on recognizing the legitimate aspirations of all peoples. In that regard, in recognizing the hope of the people of Palestine to become a State, Panama calls on the State of Israel and on Palestine to reach an agreement that will permit the coexistence of the Jewish State of Israel and the State of Palestine. The future of humankind depends on the structural capacity of each nation to address its people’s problems so that people do not attack each other.
The world today is facing two different kinds of war: armed conflicts and the ongoing wars that are being waged against poverty, inequality, the lack of opportunities and organized crime, which engender insecurity and violence, leading many young people to feel excluded and to fall prey to organized crime and terrorism. The best tool for addressing those scourges is to design State policies that offer our young people a better education, more opportunities and decent jobs and that permit them to grow up in safe neighbourhoods and communities with adequate public infrastructure. That is a task that requires the participation of Government, the private sector and civil society.
4/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
In this era of telecommunication and social networks, Panama recognizes that the exchange of information and intelligence among Governments is crucial. With the development of air and maritime connectivity, Governments and their security agencies must be able to distinguish between a tourist or business traveler and elements of organized crime. Panama is aware of its responsibility as a transit country and is moving to develop a regional security centre to combat crime in a more coordinated fashion and to support other countries of the region in that effort.
Our country is not immune from the illegal flow of migrants escaping war and seeking a better future. We reiterate our commitment to treating them with dignity and to offering them humanitarian assistance. We are taking the relevant measures in that regard and are building the necessary infrastructure in our country. Hundreds of migrants, including Africans, Latin Americans and others, pass through Panama each month, leaving their families and children behind on journeys that can take upwards of two years. When I recently asked one migrant why he had left his country, he replied that he was simply seeking a place where there was peace. We all have an obligation toward migrants. Just as we joined forces to fight the Ebola virus and HIV/AIDS, we need to continue our joint struggle to solve the problems that lead our brothers and sisters to migrate from their countries.
I am convinced that the most effective way to combat inequality and seek better days for humankind is through the honest management of our countries’ resources for the benefit of our people. In a world of such conspicuous wealth, there is no justification for the poverty that afflicts millions of its citizens. Heads of State and their collaborators must understand that politics is a form of service and that we are the temporary custodians of resources that belong to our people and for which we are accountable.
In today’s world, women suffer disproportionately from the effects of inequality, poverty, war, forced displacement during conflict, human trafficking and unequal opportunities. Therefore, Heads of State and Government and the United Nations have a critical role to play in defending and promoting the rights and freedoms of women. I reiterate the call that I made during the Global Leaders’ Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment to the effect that countries must provide more resources to combat
femicide, trafficking in persons and all acts of violence against women.
We are facing major challenges, but we also have enormous opportunities to change course and ensure a better planet for future generations. In the light of the upcoming summit on climate change in Paris, we call on all countries to reach a definitive, universal and inclusive agreement that will enable us to jointly address the damage caused to our planet, which has been so severely affected by our unsustainable practices.
The Coalition for Rainforest Nations consists of some 52 member countries and is co-chaired by Panama. The Coalition proposes to include a commitment to reducing emissions, which have been exacerbated by deforestation and forest degradation, and to strengthen mechanisms for financing. Those mechanisms also include climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. We all have the right to have access to safe drinking water, and that is one of the main challenges for our Governments. Protecting our water resources and our oceans, recovering our forests, expanding the production and distribution of safe drinking water for everyone in our countries and providing appropriate solid-waste treatment are also priorities on our agenda.
Our citizens need access to decent housing and a modern and efficient public-transport system, which are essential for improving the quality of life, and family life in particular. All States are obligated to ensure that their people have access to education and public-health systems. In our country, we have invested heavily in building, remodelling and equipping schools and hospitals, and in providing appropriate human-resources training. We are therefore taking very positive and decisive steps to reach those goals. Our economy continues to grow, and we are making progress with our social and public infrastructure plans. Those large infrastructure projects, together with a robust international financial system, will enable our service-based economy to grow and will help produce new and better employment for our young people.
In 2016, Panama will conclude our canal expansion. That and the expansion of our ports, airports and financial system are the two most important pillars of our service-based economy. Protecting our financial and logistical systems in order to ensure that they are used only for legitimate purposes is our responsibility. That is why we have strengthened our security and intelligence cooperation with other Governments. We
15-29562 5/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
have enacted important laws and undertaken reforms that protect our financial system from any negative practices. In accordance with the conclusions reached at the third International Conference on Financing For Development, held recently in Addis Ababa, I am very pleased to announce that Panama is making a commitment to increasing its international cooperation in the area of fiscal transparency.
We also announce our commitment to making further progress in automatically exchanging data and information on tax matters at the bilateral level, as our main trading partners have done. That exchange must be contingent on the right of each country to take measures that are commensurate with its capacities, national circumstances and international geopolitical realities. Each country has the right to take the necessary measures in the area of the automatic exchange of data and information that should be used for the common good. Those measures should ensure that such information will not be utilized for any purposes that would harm the competitiveness of some countries or be a detriment to others. We propose that the discussion of those particular issues be incorporated into the regular agenda of the United Nations, so that such initiatives can be discussed by countries on an equal footing. Our privileged geographical location contributes significantly to the development of our economy and our citizens. We also have a global vision of development that reflects our country’s motto, which is “Pro Mundi Beneficio” or “For the Benefit of the World”.
Strengthening the United Nations system is also our responsibility. We must review the governance structure of the United Nations, and in particular the Security Council, in order to achieve greater transparency and geographical representation. That is why Panama is actively participating in the current reform process of the Security Council and is working to bring about a rapprochement in country positions. Since the birth of the Organization, we have always reaffirmed our commitment to working together with all countries as we seek to establish the common good and to build a better world. That is why, at this very rostrum from which His Holiness Pope Francis made a call for millions of Catholics to support the United Nations on the seventieth anniversary of this noble Organization, I, as a Head of State, reaffirm Panama’s commitment to ensuring that our capacities are at the service of the international community and to working hand-in-hand
with all nations, so that we can move forward towards a world that is more just and more equitable and in which peace and dialogue will always prevail.
"
70,2015,LSO,"At the outset, let me congratulate the President on his well-deserved
election to preside over the deliberations of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. His impeccable credentials and experience ensure that we will have success in our deliberations. I also wish to assure him of my delegation’s full support and cooperation during his tenure of office.
While turning 70 is an auspicious event in the life of an individual, it has added significance and importance for an Organization that has presided over many of humankind’s trials, failures and successes. We recall with pride that many countries in Africa joyfully attained their independence through the united efforts of the Organization. That is why we make an impassioned plea for the United Nations to now address the unfinished business in North Africa and the Middle East.
Allow me to take this opportunity to commend the previous President, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his outstanding leadership during the Assembly’s sixty-ninth session. My delegation truly appreciates his tireless devotion to the onerous responsibilities entrusted to him during the past year. I also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the lucid report submitted at this session (A/70/1), which provides valuable insights into the state of our Organization and highlights a road map that will steer us into the future. We further recognize and appreciate the tedious work that our Secretary-General performs throughout the year, dousing flames of discord wherever they occur, and applaud him for sharing the joy of our Organization’s successes.
The United Nations was founded on the conviction that the nations of the world can and should cooperate to resolve conflicts peacefully and to change people’s lives for the better. It established conditions for justice, respect for international law and the promotion of socioeconomic development in the world. As the United Nations turns 70, our forebears’ abiding conviction must be steadfastly reaffirmed and their sense of purpose reasserted. In that context, we hail the theme chosen for the seventieth session, “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”, as most appropriate.
As the world’s only truly universal global Organization, the United Nations has, over the years, become the most important and relevant forum for addressing issues that transcend national boundaries. For the past 70 years, the Organization has worked tirelessly to buttress the foundations of global security
18/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
and the safety and well-being of the world’s citizenry. As a result of the work of the United Nations, in many countries corrupt dictatorships have given way to new democracies, and millions around the world today breathe the fresh air of freedom. Other notable moments of distinction in the track record of the Organization include its successful conflict-resolution and peacekeeping initiatives, helping over 17 million refugees since 1949 and ensuring that Governments meet their responsibilities to the fugitives in accordance with United Nations conventions. That notable achievement notwithstanding, we firmly believe that the world should not continue to churn out more refugees. An environment must be created to ensure a culture of religious and political tolerance so as to stop the flow of refugees.
Another milestone in the work of the United Nations is the adoption of an ambitious sustainable development agenda for the post-2015 period that epitomizes the Organization’s visionary endeavour to eradicate poverty, address climate change and ensure that prosperity is equitably shared. After frank and constructive negotiations, a few days ago we adopted the consensus outcome document (resolution 70/1). It might not be perfect, but it represents the best hope for future prosperity and stability in the world.
Looking at the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we draw courage and confidence from the fact that the majority resonate so well with the objectives of the new Coalition Government that I lead. The Coalition Government leadership has made a very ambitious commitment to ensure that Lesotho emerges from the group of least developed countries by 2025.
The practical road map under Goal 1 complements programmes already in place in Lesotho. We are humbled by the faith in our country shown by the African Union in nominating His Majesty King Letsie III as the Nutrition Champion, a move that will intensify efforts already under way in my country in the area of nutrition. On the important issue of energy, Lesotho recently launched an innovative energy policy that will ensure a substantial increase in renewable energy production, leading to an increase in the provision of affordable energy to 50 per cent by the end of this Parliament’s term. Those are just a few examples of the development programmes Lesotho is committed to implementing in the next 10 years that are in line with the SDGs just adopted.
Of greater significance is the reform process that we have emphasized in the Coalition Agreement signed after the February 2015 elections. Lesotho has passed through many political challenges since its return to democratic rule in 1993, which placed us on the agenda of the South African Development Community (SADC) for far too long. Most of those challenges have tested the resilience and relevance of our Constitution to the limit. We are now in agreement, together with our SADC partners, that constitutional reform needs to be urgently addressed as a first step on the road to political stability. The Commonwealth has also thrown its weight behind the need for such reforms. We appeal to this world body to remain seized of that process and offer the necessary guidance wherever and whenever the need arises so that Lesotho’s dignity can be restored and peace and stability can reign.
Despite the laudable achievements made by the United Nations in shaping the form and content of global dialogue and negotiations, the world is still an unequal place, with large areas beset by intolerable poverty and hunger. Thousands still die from malnutrition, while many people still live below the poverty line. Small arms and light weapons continue to be illegally traded. Those weapons are often used in violent terrorist attacks. The lack of political will to rid the world of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is obvious to all. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is not yet universal, while the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons regime is at a crossroads, with some nuclear-capable States refusing to sign on.
With the ongoing violence in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and some parts of Africa, from the Sahel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the capacity of the United Nations to find lasting solutions to these challenges is tested to the limit. Sadly, the human origin of many of these problems cannot be doubted.
Among the most pressing issues for the international community today is the problem of refugees and mass migration. As a result of war and the carnage that has exposed the depths of man’s cruelty to man, millions of people in the Middle East and elsewhere are fleeing across international borders on a scale reminiscent of the Second World War. The numbers crossing the Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea to reach Europe, despite the attendant risks, are staggering. The refugee problem Europe is facing today will test the limits of the continent’s resolve and generosity.
15-29658 19/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
Parallel to the migration crisis is the phenomenon of terrorism. Terrorism has increased worldwide, and it has become more brazen and lethal than ever before. Terrorist networks are expanding across Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Even as we remain vigilant against the threat of terrorism, we must move beyond a mindset that this menace can be defeated by force of arms alone. We may strike blows against terrorist networks, but if we ignore the fact that political instability and religious and other forms of intolerance fuel extremism, our efforts to root out that menace will be futile.
Climate change is a major challenge facing the world today, and unless it is addressed effectively it will continue to rewrite the global equation for development, peace and prosperity. We should not let the window of opportunity represented by the Paris Climate Change Conference close without collectively committing to action-oriented solutions that can significantly contribute to reducing emissions. The Paris negotiations should be guided by a spirit of frankness, mutual understanding and the willingness to compromise.
The Doha Development Agenda is important to developing countries such as mine and deserves emphasis at every available opportunity. We strongly believe that a well-functioning, rules-based multilateral trading system is in our interest. The bilateral arrangements that we are negotiating should follow the preferences and flexibilities accorded to World Trade Organization member States within the multilateral trading system. We therefore make a strong call for the Doha Development Agenda to be concluded quickly, according to its mandate and for it to fully deliver its development objectives.
Equally important is the need to acknowledge that we will never achieve real development if some sectors of society continue to be marginalized. The role of children and women and other disadvantaged groups in our communities in advancing the global development agenda must be further enhanced. As this year we celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the World Programme of Action for Youth, through which the United Nations strengthened its commitment to improving the lives of young people, let us resolve to adequately address the development needs and aspirations of young people with more vigour.
The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations offers a unique opportunity to appeal to the Security Council not to use the International Criminal Court to pursue the interests of its powerful members. We must acknowledge that in its present form and configuration, the Council will have an uphill battle to take our concerns on board. The call for the Council to be more transparent, inclusive and democratic needs to be echoed with even more vigour and clarity. A reformed Security Council that is in line with twenty-first- century geopolitical realities will be reconstructed in accordance with the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration. A Security Council that has the voice of Africa and other marginalized regions in the permanent category will increasingly acquire legitimacy and unconditional acceptance of its decisions.
We must continue to pursue a joint and consensual approach in tackling our challenges, taking decisions collectively and sharing responsibilities. The General Assembly, in whose name the United Nations was created, is most suited to fulfil that task. It has continued to serve as the principal policy-making, deliberative and most representative organ of the United Nations. It is the only platform on which all countries, big and small, can engage in face-to-face negotiations as sovereign equals to seek solutions to the problems facing humankind. The process of revitalizing the General Assembly must be hastened. The resolutions of this principal organ of the United Nations should no longer be regarded as mere recommendations that can be casually ignored. The need for the manifestation of a universal commitment to the principles upon which the United Nations is based cannot be overemphasized.
However, the United Nations is much more than a peacekeeper and a forum for conflict resolution. The United Nations and its family of agencies are engaged in a vast array of activities that seek to address challenges hindering progress in the improvement of people’s lives around the world. As indicated earlier, today’s challenges include, among others, climate change, food shortages, HIV/AIDS, financial crises, extreme poverty, population growth, urbanization, conflicts, terrorism and mass migration. The common purpose and most complex task within the United Nations family is finding practical and lasting solutions to all these problems.
For our part, Lesotho has initiated an innovative, indigenous consultative process that seeks to galvanize the collective wisdom and energy of leadership at all
20/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
levels of society, from His Majesty all the way down to local leaders, with the sole purpose of intensifying the fight against HIV/AIDS. That consultative process will ensure the leadership’s ownership and accountability in all our health-service delivery processes. We see great wisdom in redefining the rollout of primary health care, utilizing existing community-based leadership structures so as to realize the goal of health for all by 2030. That comprehensive rollout agenda has all the ingredients so well articulated in Goal 3 of the SDGs. His Majesty is expected to launch the initiative this month.
As we continue to ponder the most pressing issues and challenges facing the international community today, we should not forget the plight of the Saharan and Palestinian peoples. Both the General Assembly and the Security Council have recognized the Saharan people’s inalienable right to self-determination and independence. We support the call for a resumption of direct negotiations between the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco on an equal footing and without any preconditions. Lesotho also continues to fully support the Palestinian people in their decades-long struggle against Israeli occupation and oppression. Peace between Israel and Palestine is an essential cornerstone of the architecture of a comprehensive Middle East peace, a peace that can unlock the creative genius and entrepreneurship of the region. By the same token, we applaud the current initiatives aimed at normalizing relations between Cuba and the United States of America and urge that the unilateral sanctions on Cuba be removed sooner rather than later.
However much the world may have changed since 1945, the United Nations remains the only universal intergovernmental institution that unites us in a global community of sovereign States. Yes, the Organization may have its shortcomings, but it remains a bastion of hope for humankind. Indeed, the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session was correct in making the following observation:
“Yet for all its imperfections, which are, after all, inherent in any institution shaped by the human mind ... the Organization remains critical to addressing the growing needs of humankind. One simply cannot imagine a world in which peace and the dignity of all could flourish without the United Nations.” (see A/67/PV.1, p. 2)
I could not agree more. The responsibility for making the United Nations function optimally rests squarely with all of us. Our shared vision and objectives require much more than the reaffirmation of our commitment to the Organization’s founding principles. Greater political will is an ingredient essential to achieving the ideals that underpin the Charter of the United Nations. We look forward to a rebirth and an injection of fresh energy into the United Nations system, so that its next 70 years can be a period of even greater achievement and success. We must continue to carry out the obligation that its founding Members handed down to us with a solemn sense of responsibility on the part of all.
"
70,2015,ITA,"It is with gratitude and pride that I come here today to express the voice of the Italian people, a generous and responsible people, who every day have shown their commitment to saving the lives of hundreds of their brothers and sisters in the heart of the Mediterranean region.
This Hall calls for profound thinking rather than slogans. In every part of the world, political life is more and more fixated on the present. It is tied to discussions shaped by 24/7 news stations, the Internet and social media. Let me be clear. I belong to a generation for whom social media represent an extraordinary tool, a horizon of freedom that allows us to change lives and prospects. There is nevertheless the risk of reducing that horizon to a discussion of the next opinion poll or tweet. I think we should reject what has become a dictatorship of the moment, and take the time to pay homage to this Hall for its efforts in engaging in more meaningful reflection.
I am thinking of my country, which, on a map, appears to be shaped like a bridge, a bridge connecting North and South, Europe and Africa and East and West, a bridge that spans from the Middle East to the Balkans. Because of its geography, and especially its culture, Italy has always been a kind of extraordinary cultural laboratory affected by influences of every kind. That is the reason that we were the first country
in Europe to grasp the momentous dimension of what is happening in the Mediterranean region. From the very beginning — even in this Hall last year — we have said that the refugee question is not a question of numbers (see A/69/PV.9). The problem of migration is not one of organization or statistics. The problem is fear, the fear that runs through our societies and that we must take seriously if we wish to defeat it.
In Greek mythology, Phobos was the god of fear, able to paralyse the best armies and cause the most easily fought battles to be lost. That is why the glorious and ancient city of Sparta built a great temple to Phobos and did everything to gain his favour. Europe was born to defeat fear and replace it with the ideal of courage, peace, cooperation and civilization. And for a long time, Europe embodied that ideal. Over the past 70 years, our continent has left behind centuries of war and civil war. Europe had become a true miracle. For those like me, who as a young man witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall and found in that event a reason to devote my life to public service, to see new walls going up today is intolerable.
Europe was reborn to tear down walls, not to build them. That is why Italy is on the front line in rescuing thousands of migrants fleeing from war and despair. For that same reason, I had the privilege of accompanying Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on one of our ships currently participating in the rescue operations. Addressing migratory flows requires the capacity to respond to that emergency with a global and comprehensive strategy. In that vein, Italy has partnered with African countries through a broad array of initiatives, and in particular with the African Union, a cooperation about which I an the opportunity to speak recently at the third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa, which produced the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
In the 70 years since the birth of the Charter of the United Nations in San Francisco, the Organization has learned how crucial its role is. It has had the wisdom to recognize its mistakes and the strength to correct them by writing a new chapter that will ensure a better future for all of our children. I think that it will take an effort on the part of everyone, and Italy will not shirk from its responsibilities.
That is why we decided to present our candidature to the Security Council for a non-permanent seat for 2017-2018, with the ideal in mind of building the peace
48/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
of tomorrow. We believe that it is the job of each one of us here today to create an alternative to the culture of violence and nihilism exemplified by the recent crises in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Europe and at the borders of Europe. I am thinking, for example, of the consolidation of the ceasefire in Ukraine. I am thinking of the great joy with which we welcomed the news of the agreement between the United States and Cuba, one of extraordinary historic proportions. I am thinking of the hope that each of us now has as a consequence of the agreement with Iran on that country’s nuclear programme, which begins a new hopeful phase.
While we are committed to the implementation of that agreement, we also firmly reiterate the right of the people and the State of Israel to exist. Only through dialogue and negotiation will we be able to find a future for coming generations. Moreover, on the delicate question of Israel and Palestine, there is no alternative to dialogue. It is essential to return to the negotiating table, with the goal of reaching a solution based on two States living side-by-side in peace and security.
This open debate of the General Assembly has been characterized by many discussions on Syria. All of us have acknowledged and felt, on a very personal level, the failure that years of inertia has produced. We believe that the only way out of that quagmire is through a political solution that leads to a process of genuine transition. That will work only if we have the courage to stare reality in the face and acknowledge the presence of an enemy of unprecedented danger at our doors, namely, Daesh, the embodiment of extremism and terrorism. Through its Carabinieri corps, which plays an important role in Italy and the world, Italy is proud to lead the coalition for training the Iraqi police force. We know that the work of the security forces is decisive in ensuring daily security, enabling a family to return home without incident and enabling a mother to reassure her children. We will continue working with the global coalition to counter ISIL, in particular the United States and Saudi Arabia, and will maintain our leadership role in the working group to counter financing for Daesh.
At the same time, we underscore that Daesh is not limited to the specific region of the Middle East, even if there is an extraordinary mosaic of pluralism and beauty there. Daesh may reaffirm itself with strength in Africa, starting with Libya. From this rostrum, I renew my appeal to all the parties who hope for peace and a unified nation in Libya. We must unite our forces. Our
Libyan brothers and sisters must know that they are not alone, that the General Assembly has not forgotten them. Italy is ready to collaborate with a national unity Government and to restore cooperation in key areas so as to give Libya back its future. If the new Libyan Government asks us, Italy is ready to take on the leadership role in a mechanism, authorized by the international community, to assist in the stabilization of the country.
There are many reasons for our role in the fight against terrorism. It is a battle for values, a battle for culture. The terrorists want us to die. Failing that, they want us to live under their rules. That is why the battle that we are waging is a battle against darkness and fear, because fear is the playground of terrorism. The first area in which we see that is that of culture. When terrorists attack Palmyra or the Bardo Museum in Tunisia, or a school or a university, from Asia to Africa, they are not attacking the past, they are targeting our future.
Italy is the country where the culture of the conservation of cultural assets was born. Proud of our roots and of our Renaissance, we have the highest concentration of UNESCO cultural heritage sites in the world. That is why, together with our partner countries and friends, we aspire to be the guardians of culture throughout the world, carrying out concrete actions, both here in New York and at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, through United4Heritage, the Blue Helmets of culture. On the basis of a model developed in our country, we are proposing the establishment of an international task force, with military and civilian members, for operations to protect and rebuild art historical sites. That is our identity. That task force will be available to UNESCO, and it could be deployed in the framework of United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Let us not forget that even Europe runs the risk, in the absence of a major educational project that would show that the evil seed of terrorism is growing on European soil as well. Let us not forget that what has happened in recent months and weeks — from Charlie Hebdo in Paris to what took place in Belgium and in Denmark — involved women and men born in European countries, raised and educated in European countries and yet transformed into terrorists who sought to undermine human rights and the very raison d’être of our continent. I think, therefore, that it is important that we all succeed in this educational challenge together and that our peacekeeping model,
15-29431 49/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
which President Obama noted yesterday and for which we thank him, can serve as an established model that can be in deployed in various countries, such as is happening now in Afghanistan. I wish to recall Italy’s commitment to honouring the women and men who have sacrificed their lives for our collective security, in particular in that country. We are proud of the work of our soldiers and civilians aimed at supporting the Afghan Government on the road to peace and prosperity.
The Security Council is at the centre of the challenge. That is not a bureaucratic issue, but rather a political one. The Uniting for Consensus group is ready to continue to work with all members.
Human rights, which are today under attack, are for us a reference point at every level. I am thinking about Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security. I am thinking of resolution 69/186, adopted by the General Assembly last December, with its moratorium on the death penalty, an issue on which we will tirelessly work. I also recall the words that the Holy Father Pope Francis pronounced here (see A/70/PV.3) and at the United States Congress. The resolutions against forced and early marriage (resolution 68/148) and against female genital mutilation (resolution 67/146) are clear signs of the shared commitment of our world community.
The deep connection between peace and security and between human rights and development is also the message of the current Universal Exposition in Milan. The slogan of Expo 2015, “Feeding the Planet: Energy for Life”, is a message that brings together many of the aspirations of the General Assembly, in particular that of promoting sustainable agriculture. I wish to make a commitment, especially to the African countries, that we will never stop working in that direction, bolstered by Italian know-how and the desire to work together. Guaranteeing access to food for all, fighting world hunger, changing consumption patterns, ensuring the centrality of women as central stakeholders in agriculture, defending smallholder farmers, as well as easing tensions and conflicts caused by the degradation of arable land and the scarcity of water for irrigation, are not secondary issues.
The legacy of Expo Milan is assured by the Charter of Milan and by the commitments of each of us to fight climate change. Italy stands alongside Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon and is mobilizing the necessary
resources to ensure that the conferences in Lima and Paris are successful.
With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), Italy has accepted the challenge of the five Ps — people, prosperity, partnership, planet and peace, which we recognize and which inspire our action for the future. But let me say that Italy intends to contribute with strength, in particular in those battles in which some countries seem to be alone. In the next few weeks in Milan, we will welcome our partners, the small island developing States, which are considered small States but are actually great States for their value, to the events on climate-change adaptation that will take place in mid-October at Expo Milan, and we will bring a large delegation to Venice, where we will show participants, in one of the most beautiful artistic cities in the world, how we are working to combat the risks associated with the presence of high waters and the lack of attention on the part of the international community.
In conclusion, as a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council, Italy wants the values we have discussed to occupy a central place in the Security Council. But I do not want us to think of those values in an abstract way. I do not want us to forget that what brings us here is not a document. It is a face; it is many faces.
In Italian schools, our children learn about the strong connection among the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, Africa and the Middle East. Today, those children are not just extras in a movie. They are the reason why we are here today. We believe that of all the values we teach our children at school we cannot forget that the first value is life.
Faced with the migration crisis, many of us were deeply moved this summer by the photo of a little boy named Aylan. He was a child from Kobani, who, together with his older brother, fell asleep without ever being able to see the future. He was photographed, dead, on the beach at Bodrum. We must not limit our commitment to the emotion of the moment. We must bear that image in mind and commit to doing our best. Many children have died in the heart of the Mediterranean. They died on the ships launched in the direction of Europe by traffickers, the new slave traders of today. However, together with all of those children who are no longer with us, I want to recall the names of children whom no one talks about: Yambambi,
50/51 15-29431

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16
Salvatore, Idris Ibrahim and Francesca Marina. They are some of the children who were born on the ships of the Italian Marines and Coast Guard, which saved thousands of women, and in some cases enabled them to give birth on those ships. I wish to thank my fellow citizens for the extraordinary work that they have carried out. I want their names to be remembered with the names of those who did not make it. Their heroic actions should serve as an admonishment for all of us. Politics can be restored to dignity when we are aware of the enormity of our challenges. The old Europe, born in
the name of courage, does not give in to fear. Italy will proudly do its part.
"
70,2015,SAU,"Seventy years have passed since the United Nations was founded, and we are gathered here today to recall together the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. My country was among the founding signatory Members in 1945.
We all realize that the United Nations came into the world in the wake of two world wars that resulted in enormous financial and human costs, something that makes us understand the importance of upholding the principles of the Charter, aimed at establishing security and stability in our world. Paramount among those principles is that of preventing new destructive and lethal wars and conflicts. We should not forget
20/26 15-29876

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24
that the main principle and goal is the maintenance of international peace and security. That can be achieved only by promoting justice, equality and respect for international law among our nations, and in particular the principle of State sovereignty, in accordance with the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, which established State independence and sovereignty as the basis of modern international relations.
The Palestinian question has become a permanent item on the General Assembly’s agenda. Today, despite all the initiatives and opinions that have been put forward, the Palestinian people continue to suffer and to be deprived of their right to live in dignity, in flagrant defiance of the rules of international law and internationally legitimate resolutions. We are in urgent need of a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, based on the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the Arab Peace Initiative, which was promoted by my country and adopted 13 years ago by the Arab and Islamic worlds and has garnered wide international support. Its aim is to establish an independent Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. That is why we repeat our denunciation of Israel’s violations of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which have exacerbated the conflict, as well as extremism and violence in the world.
The crisis in Syria has now entered its fifth year. The international community continues to be incapable of taking decisive steps to save the Syrian people from the machinery of killing, destruction and forced displacement operated by Bashar Al-Assad, which has resulted in the deaths of more than 300,000 people and the displacement of 12 million Syrians and the destruction of the country in one of the worst humanitarian disasters we have seen in our times. The only way to resolve this crisis is through a political solution based on the Geneva I final communiqué (A/66/865, annex), in order to maintain Syria’s national unity and preserve its State institutions, both civil and military, and to create a transitional council on which Bashar Al-Assad and those who have Syrian blood on their hands have no place. We will continue to push for such a solution and will be among the first countries to support the Syrian people and to contribute to alleviating their suffering.
The legitimate coalition forces accomplished much in Yemen. Chief among their achievements was the liberation of the city of Aden and of the Bab al-Mandab Strait, which secured international maritime freedom. The military option was a last resort following the
coup d’état staged by the Houthis and Saleh in which they seized power and laid siege to the presidential palace and residence in Aden, thereby threatening the legitimate President. In response, we initiated a military intervention on the basis of a demand by the legitimate Government of Yemen and in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. Our aim is to find a political solution based on the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative, the conclusions of the national dialogue, and Security Council resolution 2216 (2015). Although we recognize that the Houthis are part and parcel of the social fabric in Yemen, that does not give them the prerogative to own militias outside the framework of the State of Yemen or at the expense of the rest of the Yemeni people.
Certain parties are trying to exacerbate and escalate the crisis in Yemen through incitement and arms smuggling, as when an Iranian ship laden with arms for the rebels was intercepted on 26 September. Our Kingdom and our partners are intensifying efforts in order to mobilize international humanitarian assistance to Yemen. The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre has provided assistance to the brotherly people of Yemen. His Majesty, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, is striving to improve the conditions of the Yemenis who live illegally in the Kingdom by providing employment, education and health care.
Convinced that the realization of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations should focus on the maintenance of security and peace the world over, we were in the vanguard of the nations calling for a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. That is why we welcomed the recent agreement between the P5+1 and the Islamic Republic of Iran, which prevents Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. We call on Iran to renounce its meddling in Arab affairs, which we will firmly resist in our desire to build good-neighbourly relations with Iran, based on mutual respect, good neighbourliness and non-interference in the affairs of other countries. We also call on Iran to end its occupation of the three islands in the Arabian Gulf belonging to the sisterly United Arab Emirates.
We are among the States targeted by terrorism and extremism. We continue to fight terrorists and are determined to find a way to eradicate the grave phenomenon of terrorism. We were among the first countries to combat terrorism in all its intellectual and ideological aspects and to seek to cut off its financial
15-29876 21/26

A/70/PV.24 01/10/2015
resources. We denounce the attempt by terrorists to attribute their crimes to Islam, the religion of love, peace, moderation and tolerance.
We attach primary importance to development issues, especially in developing countries. Successful development hinges on the international community’s respect for a nation’s specificities, whether historical, ethnic, religious or cultural. The achievement of sustainable development should therefore take into account the specific aims of each individual country and its particular level of development. For that reason, we have been actively and directly involved in shaping the Sustainable Development Goals.
In closing, I wish to stress the role of the United Nations and its bodies in our changing world. The challenges we face in various fields make it incumbent upon us to enhance the role of the United Nations and to reinvigorate its bodies, pushing ahead with the reform of the Organization so that it can keep pace with the changes in the international arena.
"
70,2015,MOZ,"It is with great honour that, once again, on behalf of the people of Mozambique and, indeed, on my own behalf, I address the General Assembly at its seventieth session. As we celebrate 70 years of our Organization, we are cognizant
of the fact that we are not here just to commemorate a mere event. We are also celebrating the realization of the desire to build a universal Organization that carries out activities with a global perspective and with a structured and institutionalized scope and a capacity to evolve and adapt.
We are celebrating one of the wisest decisions that humankind has ever made, namely, to establish an international body responsible for peace, security and the development of member countries. It is an Organization created to prevent humankind from experiencing a world war or violent conflicts whose effects are felt at the global level. We are celebrating a mutual commitment to strengthen international law as an instrument for regulating and standardizing relations between and among States. Those relations are based on the principle of sovereign equality among States, the peaceful settlement of disputes and non-interference in domestic affairs. Those positive and inspiring ideals contrast, however, with the prevailing conflict situations, which still affect humankind. We would not be fair to ourselves, to our peoples or to future generations, if we ignored the challenges and failures that are to be overcome.
The United Nations has failed to guarantee international peace and security in its full sense. Old and new challenges have emerged, and inter- and intra-State conflicts have proliferated, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. The phenomenon of terrorism is growing and becoming the most serious threat of our time. Decolonization is yet to be completed. Underdevelopment, exacerbated by the problem of refugees and illegal migration, is far from becoming a thing of the past. However, those failures should not be regarded fatalistically. They should be taken up as challenges, which require more than mere words as a response. Most importantly, they require concerted action by the international community. Without the United Nations, the political, economic and social context in which we find ourselves would surely be worse.
In celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, the theme for this session, “A new commitment to action”, represents a reaffirmation of our commitment to keep alive our objective of protecting future generations from the violence of war and to ensure inclusive social and economic development in full freedom. There is, therefore, one response to those phenomena and trends, and that is
to translate the theme, “A new commitment to action”, into concrete, structured and tangible actions. For Mozambique, the commitment to action in the area of international peace and security includes, inter alia, the adoption and implementation of effective structures for the prevention and management of conflicts, as well as the need to conclude a convention against terrorism. The emphasis should be on preventive diplomacy. The commitment to action that we are celebrating here should establish platforms for dialogue among cultures and civilizations as an essential tool for promoting tolerance, the culture of peace and a dignified and peaceful world.
With respect to development, we are delighted at the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which is our new global development framework for the next 15 years. It is an agenda that follows and builds on the Millennium Development Goals, which have guided us over the past 15 years. Therefore, any action we take in future should not ignore the successes achieved and lessons learned. Like other countries, Mozambique has achieved remarkable progress in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. We have expanded access to education, improved gender balance in access to primary education and met the target set for infant- mortality reduction.
The new post-2015 development agenda embodies our collective ambition to transform the world by 2030. The new Agenda brings back human dignity by fighting poverty and protecting people and the planet. At the core of the new Agenda is the culmination of a series of negotiation processes, at the global level, on climate change. The new post-2015 development agenda is perfectly in line with our Government’s five-year programme. It is not an end in itself, but it has the added value of focusing on people. It is founded on the so-called sustainable development pillars, namely, the economic, social and environmental dimensions.
It is our desire that we should meet in 2030, at another historic event just like this one, to celebrate the implementation of the goals and common vision, as reflected in the new Agenda, whose full title is “Transforming our world: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. If that is to be possible, Mozambique maintains that, among other things, it is of paramount importance that the commitment to action include the need to mobilize the requisite resources in
a timely manner. Significant resources will be required for the implementation of the new Agenda if it is to maintain continuous relevance. In that regard, we must follow the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and keep in mind how important it is that all partners respect the commitments made and the agreed international development goals. It is also important that the appropriate technology transfers to developing countries take place and that aid be granted without political conditionalities. We must also strengthen North-South, South-South, and bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms in accordance with internationally agreed principles and respect for national realities and local content.
As all may be aware, Mozambique was one of the 50 countries selected by the United Nations to host national consultations. That sample contributed to the development of the new guiding instrument that is the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). The process included the broadest spectrum of social and professional elements, and, to our satisfaction, its results were taken into consideration in the report of the Secretary-General (A/70/1).
If the post-2015 development Agenda is to be truly transformative and successful, it must be integrated into and owned by policymaking instruments at the national level. Indicators and targets should be defined clearly to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of progress. Mozambique has already taken an important step by incorporating the three-dimensional approach of the post-2015 development Agenda into the Government’s five-year programme 2015-2019, which defines five priorities, namely: consolidating national unity, peace and sovereignty; developing human and social capital; promoting employment, productivity and competitiveness; developing economic and social infrastructures; and ensuring the sustainable and transparent management of natural resources and the environment. We reiterate here our commitment to continued capacity-building in the area of domestic resources mobilization, which increased from 13 per cent of our gross domestic product in 2006 to 25 per cent in 2014.
The inability of the United Nations to fully achieve the purpose for which it was established is one of the issues that concern us. It is hard to understand why the United Nations is hampering the implementation of its own mandate. We should be here today to celebrate the completion of the reform of the Security Council and
the opening up of new opportunities to create a world in which people enjoy the most basic rights, including peace and development. The role of that reform in providing underlying support for the successful implementation of the post-2015 development Agenda should not be underestimated. We should therefore translate our renewed mutual will to reform the Security Council into practical results, and we should take advantage of the environment created for this session to provide greater dynamism to the reform process.
The celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations and the adoption of the post-2015 development Agenda are being overshadowed by an unprecedented crisis at the international level. I am referring to the humanitarian crisis caused by a flow of refugees and migrants that is unparalleled in recent history. That shocking situation is due to a succession of unresolved crises and to poorly handled situations with outcomes that are far from meeting the expectations of the international community.
Today we are committed to adopting measures to minimize the plight of those people. However, little will be achieved if we continue to focus on short-term cosmetic measures, rather than respond to the need to curtail the flow of refugees and migrants at the source. We need to address the underlying problems of this phenomenon, which explain the tragic human proportions of the crisis. We will be in no position to identify effective actions unless we, the international community, recognize our own failure. We are talking about the proliferation of conflicts and political, social and economic exclusion. We are talking about poverty, injustice and hunger.
We have noted how dialogue has been replaced by threats and aggression. We have noted how fear has replaced a willingness to achieve mutual agreement. Some of the ways to address the situation have been known for a long time. In that regard, we call upon all leaders to redouble their efforts to find lasting solutions to the humanitarian crisis. We have followed with keen interest and much satisfaction the latest positive developments aimed at normalizing bilateral relations between the United States of America and Cuba. We continue to encourage actions aimed at ending the economic, trade and financial embargo against Cuba, without prejudice to the legitimate interests of any of those concerned. Although we may meet all of the targets of the post-2015 development Agenda, our mission as
an international community will not be complete until we use wisdom and implement the political processes.
As is well known, Mozambique was one of the countries most affected by the presence of landmines. In acknowledgement of the importance of mine clearance for promoting an atmosphere of peace, security and development, Mozambique became a party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, also known as the Ottawa Convention. From the outset, we have made every effort to comply with the obligations arising from the Ottawa Convention. In that regard, I am pleased to announce that Mozambique has successfully completed its demining programme. We have cleared all known risk areas, which totalled 500 million square metres of land.
It would not have been worthwhile for us to liberate our country if then we had been forbidden to travel across our country, or if we had been forbidden to farm the land or develop tourism or mine our coal or graphite. We celebrate that victory with intense emotion. We would like to express our profound gratitude to our international partners, humanitarian demining organizations, United Nations agencies and civil society for their cooperation and invaluable support.
The year 2015 is of special importance to Mozambique. On 25 June, we celebrated 40 years of independence. We are no longer an adolescent State. On 16 September we celebrated 40 years of cooperation with the United Nations. I am jubilant because I am speaking here today, at the United Nations, and I believe that the United Nations should feel proud on account of my country’s stability and growth — growth that needs to be supported.
I would like to conclude my remarks by reiterating that the search for sustainable solutions to global problems, alongside the Organization and its Member States, will continue to be the focus of my Government’s unconditional commitment. Long live humankind and sustainable development!
"
70,2015,ATG,"Democracy, peace, security, rule of law and respect for human rights are crucial elements in achieving the economic and social development to which my people aspire. We are aware that, just as no development can take place without democracy, peace, security and the rule of law, so, too, little peace and certainly no security will exist without development. Development, peace and security, therefore, go hand in hand. They are inextricably linked.
But I am disappointed that some nations within this body fail to recognize that if development is denied to any section of humanity, so too are human rights. Today, we live in a world where — despite all the utterances to the contrary — might is still right, and the big and strong continue to bully the poor, the weak and the vulnerable. Until small States such as mine are no longer bullied by larger and more powerful nations, despite our full compliance with international standards and practices, human rights will continue to be denied. As the Organization enters its seventy- first year, it is time that Member States stop paying lip service to the principle of sovereignty. They must show that they truly respect the sovereignty of States regardless of their size.
In the years since our independence the people of Antigua and Barbuda have built solid institutions of
democracy and respect for human, civil and political rights. We guard those institutions jealously, and we have enshrined them in our Constitution and in our laws. And we do so not only for ourselves, but for every investor in our country, every visitor to our shores and every other country with which we have treaties or conduct business.
However, my country is beset with all the problems and challenges that confront all small States. They include remoteness, high transactional costs, threats to our survival from climate change, a limited economic base and a small resource pool to fund and manage our development aspirations. Those realities make it difficult, if not impossible, for my small country to finance its development, without external assistance and without access to foreign capital. But the people of my country do not wish to be beggars before the world community. We do not want to attend meetings, cap in one hand, begging bowl in the other. Yes, we want the sympathy and understanding of the international financial institutions and development agencies. Yes, we want better terms of trade and more reasonable access to development financing. But we are also determined to stand on our own two feet and to earn our place among the community of nations. We are resolved not to beg for it, but to work for it. However, the international community, particularly the rich and the powerful, must help us to work for the development we need, instead of placing obstacles in our way.
Yet, 11 years after the World Trade Organization delivered a judgement in my country’s favour against a larger and vastly richer country for a trade violation that set back my small country by over $100 million, that country has failed to settle with us. Justice delayed is justice denied. After 11 years of not receiving the fruits of that judgement, which, incidentally, are lawfully due to my country, my people are entitled to conclude that the powerful continue to ignore and trample on the rights of the weak and that might is right.
In the international trading system, my small country with a population of 100,000 people is treated in the same way as the United States of America, Canada or Japan. Our market size and development status, which require us to be treated differently from larger and vastly more developed countries, receive scant attention. Our need for access to concessionary financing to fund our development is accorded even less attention. At best, we are treated with benign neglect. The arbitrary and unjust rules that are imposed
15-29664 13/25

A/70/PV.23 01/10/2015
upon us choke our efforts to diversify and develop our small economies and are even worse.
In that regard, my country condemns the recent list of the European Commission, in which several small States in the Caribbean and the Pacific, including Antigua and Barbuda, are falsely named as tax havens. Similarly, my country deplores the list of tax havens produced by individual States and a district within the United States of America that has wrongfully and inappropriately labelled many Caribbean and Pacific countries.
My country and others in the Caribbean all have tax information exchange agreements with the Government of the United States of America. We have been fully cooperative and no request for tax information has ever been denied. With regard to the European Union’s (EU) list of tax havens, Antigua and Barbuda has tax information exchange agreements with 18 of the 28 EU nations. Yet, because 10 of them, with which we do little or no business, arbitrarily and without consultation say that we are tax havens, we are placed on an EU rogue list that is published globally.
What is more, my country and many of the others wrongly named in both lists have been found to be fully compliant with all the relevant international standards. And the relevant authorities namely, the Financial Action Task Force and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, have also found us to be fully compliant.
It cannot be right that powerful countries unjustly tarnish our small country’s reputation, despite all that we have done—at great cost in view of our limited resources — to comply with international standards. Such wrongful tarnishing opens the possibility of financial institutions in Europe and the United States discontinuing correspondent relations with our banks. If that happens, no one in our small States will be able to pay for any goods or services purchased from the United States or Europe, including food, tuition for our young studying abroad, and medication and medical bills for our people in need of specialized treatment.
The consequences would be disastrous, since we would be excluded from the international payment system and would be unable to settle our trade and investment transactions. Our banking system would collapse, our economy would be irreparably damaged, and our people would be plunged into abject poverty,
contrary to the objectives of the post-2015 development Agenda.
International principles to which small States readily adhere should not be overturned by bigger countries that seek to impose their will on smaller ones. It is not fair; it is not just; it is not democratic; and it is patently wrong.
My country is not looking for handouts, nor are many others like mine. We do not want to endure the indignity of begging. What we want is a chance to develop, a chance to improve the living standards of our people.
In this regard, I wish to salute the Government of the People’s Republic of China, whose President, in this very Hall a few days ago, undertook to establish a fund for South-South cooperation with a pledge of $2 billion to support developing countries in the implementation of the post-2015 development Agenda. I further hail China’s announcement of a 10-year, $1 billion fund to support the work of the United Nations in peacekeeping and development. China should be acknowledged and applauded for the care it is demonstrating for others in the global community.
I acknowledge, too, the contributions of two other developing nations, Venezuela and Cuba, which have made significant contributions to South-South cooperation.
Despite the economic challenges that these three developing countries face, they have given help to other countries unstintingly. If these three countries, challenged as they are, can recognize an obligation to all humankind, regardless of race or colour or of a country’s size or geographical location, surely rich and developed countries should be able to do the same. I call on these developed countries to stand up and be counted.
I applaud those countries, such as Britain, Germany and Sweden, that have met their commitments to deliver 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product as official development assistance. I urge the others to follow their lead and to join them not as a giveaway to beggars but as an investment in a safer and more peaceful world, whose progress will contribute to the prosperity of all humankind.
On the matter of peace and security, my country firmly believes that the world’s prospects for peace
14/25 15-29664

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.23
and security were greatly enhanced by two recent developments.
The first is the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States of America. We hail that accord, and we call upon the United States Congress to lift the embargo against Cuba, which serves no one’s interest or any useful purpose. Further, we support the call for the United States to return Guantanamo Bay to Cuba.
At the same time, my country congratulates the United States Government on the agreement reached with Iran. While we are mindful of the fact that five other countries were involved in the process, we recognize that President Obama faced the most difficult circumstances. We commend his far-sightedness, as we applaud the willingness of all of the participating countries, including Iran, to overcome obstacles through negotiations and dialogue.
The President of Iran told the Assembly that while his country will not forget the past, it does not wish to live in the past. He has committed his nation to the practical path to security and stability through the development that comes with economic engagement. My country welcomes that commitment and, in turn, stands ready to participate with Iran in such economic engagement.
I express Antigua and Barbuda’s deep concern at the devastation of neighbouring Caribbean island Dominica by tropical storm Erika. I also want to make the point that countries in the Caribbean did not await an international response. In fact, we went ahead and provided aid to Dominica and its suffering people, and we did so within the limited capacity of our respective States members of the Caribbean Community. We made immediate financial and other tangible contributions to Dominica.
Despite our own challenges, we stood up for the humanitarian needs of our neighbour. But even as we did so, we were aware that wider international support is necessary. Therefore, I appeal for continued international action for Dominica in its recovery process. I also express my country’s deep worry about the Bahamas, which is being battered by a Category 4 hurricane even as I address the Assembly. There is no greater evidence, if any were needed, that climate change is now one of the most serious challenges facing small island States. The time for action on climate change is now. There is no more time for excuses.
Climate change is the greatest threat confronting all of humankind. It knows no borders, and it respects neither size nor economic and military power. All of our countries are its potential victims, even where its existence and danger continue to be denied. But it poses the greatest threat to the smallest on our shared planet, particularly the island States in the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.
What happened in Dominica a few weeks ago also befell Vanuatu and Tuvalu in the Pacific earlier this year. What is sad is that these disasters are not occurring in these islands through their own fault. They are happening because of the excesses of larger and more powerful countries, which will not bend from their abuse of the world’s atmosphere even at the risk of eliminating other societies, some older than their own.
Increasingly, several of these islands are drowning, and their age-old civilizations are facing extinction. In this connection, I hail the clean-energy proposal of United States, and I commend President Obama for this initiative. It is a most enlightened proposal, as a result of which the people of the United States will not only maintain the quality of their own country but will also stand up for the rights of other societies to have a homeland and to raise their children in the land of their ancestors.
I am thinking particularly of the people of the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu in the Pacific; of Maldives in the Indian Ocean; and a few Caribbean islands where the prospect of disappearance looms large from sea- level rise. All industrialized nations should accept their responsibilities as chief contributors in emitting high levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. If the countries of the United Nations want their pledge for democracy, human rights and peace to be meaningful, they must resolve to make the Conference on Climate Change in Paris later this year a resounding success. That success will be best measured if our nations collectively ensure that the outcome of the Conference is an ambitious international agreement that limits global warming below 2°C, in order to ensure the survival of small States. Financing is also important. Not because we are begging, but because the world’s interests are served by it. Financing the cost of mitigation must be done through an internationally legally binding commitment to additional and predictable support.
I want to end my statement by thanking God for the United Nations. If it did not exist, small countries such as mine would have no voice at all. We know the United

Nations needs reform to make it more democratic and certainly more representative. But, within its bodies, we have a platform and an opportunity to hold up a mirror to the world that reflects the marginalization we confront. That is of great value to us. My country hopes for a tomorrow that offers us better prospects, where the opportunities in the world are not monopolized by the rich few but are shared for the advancement of all humankind. In this Organization, fair-minded nations, acting together, still have the chance to make equity a reality for the small as much as for the big.
"
70,2015,HND,"We are speaking in the Assembly today, as His Holiness Pope Francis said, as an afterthought. The President of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, appeared a few days ago in this Hall, addressing the Sustainable Development Summit (see A/70/PV.5). At this final stage of the debate we are not going to overwhelm the Assembly with long speeches, when so many renowned leaders, speaking on behalf of their States, have already delivered more informed views on the contentious issues that concern us.
All of us who have the singular privilege of using this unique platform in this unique forum, where we
discuss feelings, opinions, criticisms and reflections on the world’s most important issues, are influenced by the places that we come from and our particular perspectives on the world. It could not be otherwise, for we are the products of our origins and environment. It is natural that those of us who come from places of dire deprivation, pressing needs and miserable exclusion, see things differently from those from areas of wealth, abundance, power and superiority. We even differ in how we understand the universal terms of law, justice and equity. It is even true that we can question what is the truth itself, if we are not familiar with another’s perception of the truth.
We all react according to our own reality. How can victims who have to leave their homes and embark on terrible migrations for reasons of extreme poverty or situations of overwhelming violence, in search of a better life and an unclouded future for their loved ones, understand the concept of law and justice in the same way as those who enjoy all possible assurances and opportunities and who do not want their comfort disrupted by inconvenient strangers? Perhaps what we do not see in this dichotomy in the interpretation of essential human values is that there can be no peace or security for anyone unless there is peace and well- being for all. There is no stone wall, no human law, no physical obstacle that can contain the movement of human beings being compelled by the right to life.
Of course, it is our homelands that we belong to and that our hearts return to, our inalienable lands with their tears and smiles, setbacks and celebrations, hardships and riches, boundaries and expanses, reservations and dreams, gaps and opportunities. We all want to be born and die in our homelands. But for many, the cradle can sometimes also be the fence that limits us and constrains our yearning for the possible. The shadows of fear created by insecurity and the struggle for survival provoked by scarcity are powerful forces that can drive anyone to leave their homes and undertake a terrible journey to the unknown. Serious and desperate circumstances compel people to leave what they cherish the most. The urge to survive and the attachment to freedom know no borders. Mass migrations are only a symptom of other acute problems that must be addressed. And we all have a responsibility to address those problems, but, first and foremost, we need to produce results rather than just promises, because despair saps even the most long-suffering patience.

The answer to that serious dilemma is not something that we have to invent. It lies at the foundation of the natural values of civilization, in the divine principles of spirituality where all religions converge, in the doctrines of the Charter of the United Nations that inspired the very existence of the United Nations — harmonious and respectful coexistence among brothers and sisters of the same world family, where all of us are citizens of a common home, regardless of race, gender, creed or origin; and where there is, of course, universal solidarity, so that no one abuses resources that others lack, and the offer of a fraternal hand where it is needed.
"
70,2015,TLS,"It is with the utmost pleasure that I address the Organization today. It is a privilege for me to take the floor for the first time in the General Assembly, particularly because the Member States have come together to celebrate the Organization’s seventieth anniversary.
This is undoubtedly a historic moment in the life of the United Nations, when we can celebrate and honestly reflect on the principles and spirit that led to the establishment of the Organization, as well as the failures and successes of the past 70 years. Those failures and successes are intimately associated with various world events, including the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, whose status as a sovereign State was internationally recognized on 20 May 2002.
Nonetheless, the world has changed dramatically since the Charter of the United Nations was signed seven decades ago, in 1945. Today, we are an Organization with 193 Member States, many of which were formed after the end of the Second World War. The world in the twenty-first century is marked by a combination of complexities, challenges and different opportunities
18/25 15-29664

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.23
that require coordinated actions by the States. While in the 1940s we already had the audacity to proclaim that no country is an island, that adage is even more relevant in our own century with the advances in communication and transportation technologies that transform our world into a global village in which distance and location are no longer impediments to interaction among peoples and States. It requires from us a stronger commitment to understanding and cooperation as a means to better capitalize on the potential and to minimize the adverse risks of that new reality.
Our commitment to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the multilateral system therefore constitutes an indispensable element in the interactions of humankind in our century. Today, using the words of the Preamble to the Charter, we must repeat our undertaking “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” and “reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights” with dignity and equality for all. We must strengthen our commitment to “justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law” and to “social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom”.
Those ideals are the pillars of the Organization and have guided its work since its foundation, but we must acknowledge that we have yet to respond to the aspirations of all peoples in all nations of the world. Now is an opportune moment to renew our efforts towards fulfilling those principles. To that end, the United Nations needs a reform that will allow it to take up the challenges that have emerged in the new circumstances of our century. Reforming the Security Council is one change that has been suggested, with a view to making the Council more representative and balanced. Improving the system is the only way for us to be prepared for the long journey ahead and for us to honour and fulfil the promise of peace, security and human rights for all.
At the United Nations sustainable development Summit a few days ago, from 25 to 27 September, we all met to launch the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). Through the changes outlined on the new Agenda, we have redefined the pillar of development for the United Nations and set the planet on the path to sustainable development. The dynamic of change must now focus on the other pillars of the Organization, which are peace, security and human rights.
The United Nations was born out of the need for States to develop closer relations and work together in a world dismayed and marked by war. Yet, conflicts and violence continue to ravage the world, and millions of people continue to be forced to abandon their homes and countries. We currently have the largest number of refugees since the Second World War, and estimates indicate that the number will increase. In addition to those refugees, there are many other people who migrate in search of better opportunities.
We are seeing thousands of people arriving in Europe every day, trying to escape threats to their lives, which they face in the conflict zones in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, among several other countries. It is crucial that we bear in mind that we must provide those who are forced to flee persecution and armed conflict with the protection to which they are entitled under international law. We cannot forget that crises, wherever they crop up, can drag on and spread indiscriminately, affecting economies, social life, peace and stability in particular regions and in the world. Notwithstanding the progress achieved since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945, we must acknowledge that there remains much to do and fulfil. Conflicts and crises persist in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe and the Americas. The Saharans, Palestinians and many other peoples continue to be denied their fundamental rights.
When there is disagreement, leaders must recognize that dialogue is a means to an end. Timor- Leste is particularly pleased that the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba have re-established diplomatic relations. It congratulates them and hopes that a frank and open dialogue will quickly lead to the removal of impediments to economic, financial and trade relations.
New and different threats to peace, security and human rights have emerged since the creation of the United Nations. Terrorism, organized crime and extreme violence are new obstacles to international peace and security. The United Nations and the international community must adapt to those new threats in order to ensure a process to build peace and to build an inclusive, responsible and transparent State with a view to achieving lasting peace.
Another challenge, which may not appear as consistently in the mass media but which affects us equally, is climate change, and the international community is approaching a moment of decision in that
15-29664 19/25

A/70/PV.23 01/10/2015
regard. The discussions that will take place at the end of the year at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris, must produce universal, ambitious and legally binding results. It is time to act with respect to climate change. The whole world is advancing towards a consensus that recognizes the urgency of combating climate change, including citizens, civil society and religious leaders, as seen in the message of His Holiness Pope Francis (see A/70/PV.3) and the declaration by Muslim leaders, which underscore our moral duty to protect those who are most vulnerable and to care for the planet we inhabit.
We also know that the impacts of climate change are even more pronounced in the developing small island States, which are on the front lines of the struggle. Our neighbouring islands in the Pacific have been assailed by the same storms and by an increase in the number of natural disasters, which are compounded, as if that were not enough, by soil erosion and the rise of sea levels.
Timor-Leste has been a part of the community of nations for 13 years and is ready to roll up its sleeves, leverage its national experience and contribute to the international community. We are a young nation, but that has never been nor will it ever be a reason for us to ignore the events and realities of the world we share. We officially announce our desire to join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, boost progress in fragile States through the Group of Seven Plus and accede to the international mechanisms for the promotion of peace, democracy, justice and human rights.
We have been serving in the presidency pro tempore of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries since 2014. We wish to instil a new dynamic in that Community of sister nations and bring it to the forefront of economic globalization, with investment opportunities that could improve the living conditions of our peoples and contribute to the development, peace, and stability of the peoples of the world. We have had the opportunity to share our experience with other brotherly countries and peoples, such as Guinea- Bissau, Sao Tome et Principe, and the Central African Republic.
Timor-Leste’s participation on the stage of international politics reflects our conviction as to the importance of solidarity, mutual respect, and cooperation for a better world. We have also undergone a Government transition recently. After many years at
the helm of the country, our outstanding leaders and former Presidents of the Republic, Xanana Gusmão and José Ramos-Horta, who are present here today, understood that Timor-Leste lacked a model of inclusive democracy. That type of democracy, which gave rise to the sixth constitutional Government, which is currently in office, was achieved peacefully and with dignity. The Government that I am honoured to lead is committed to preserving the peace and stability that has been achieved. It is also committed to continuing the efforts of previous Governments to foster growth and development in our country and the well-being of our people.
However, the road ahead for the Timorese is still long and arduous. In addition to building our institutions and promoting sustainable development, the national consensus in Timor-Leste is that we must work to fully assert our national sovereignty under international law and standards. That full assertion of our sovereignty includes the demarcation of our maritime borders with our two great neighbours, Indonesia and Australia. As a matter of principle, Timor-Leste has opted for negotiations in accordance with international law and standards and, when dialogue fails to resolve disagreements, our country has chosen to use international conflict-resolution mechanisms.
Though small, Timor-Leste has also helped other nations in their development efforts. The recent report of the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations (see A/70/95), chaired by former President José Ramos- Horta, proposed fundamental shifts for the future of peace operations, which will have an impact on the lives of thousands of people. The four major shifts proposed by the Panel would help to enhance the credibility, relevance and legitimacy of the United Nations, thus making it more effective in preventing and resolving conflicts, and in peacemaking and peacekeeping, so that people can live in security and freedom.
Over the past three years, we have witnessed an unprecedented effort on the part of the States Members of the United Nations, and the international community in general, to redefine our approach to sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) embodies a remarkable balance of interests and priorities in its set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are profoundly interlinked and indivisible. Timor-Leste is particularly pleased with the inclusion of Goal 16, which strengthens the essential elements of peace, justice, and
20/25 15-29664

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.23
institutions. We know from our own experience that those elements are crucial to our joint commitment not to leave anyone behind on our path towards sustainable development. Goal 16 is the basis for a truly inclusive Agenda and, together with Goals 5 and 17, serves as the cornerstone for achieving the other Goals. Timor- Leste is committed to working with other countries and development partners and sharing what little we have to implement those Goals and the other SDGs.
In conclusion, I wish to thank the United Nations, its Secretary-General, the President of the General Assembly and all States Members of the United Nations here present, as well as all the sectors of society that supported us in our struggle for liberation until we were recognized as a sovereign State. It is with humility that we once again express our profound gratitude and declare our commitment to being a part of this great team of nations that fights tirelessly for a more prosperous, just, and peaceful world. We believe that nations, when united, are much stronger and produce better results.
"
70,2015,LUX,"The United Nations was created, not to lead humankind to heaven but to save it from hell. These were the apt words of Mr. Dag Hammarskjöld, who served as the second Secretary-General, from 1953 to 1961, and saw things for what they were. The United Nations was created according to the people’s will 70 years ago, following the Second World War, to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Today, in a world beset by armed conflict, violent extremism, radicalization and terrorism, in a world where war, persecution and violations of human rights force millions and millions of people — men, women and children — to leave their homes and to take to the road in mass exoduses in search of safety and dignity, the achievement of that goal seems far more urgent than ever.
The choice of theme for the seventieth session of the General Assembly, “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”, was
15-29658 39/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
wise indeed. As we have said many times from this rostrum, human rights and the rule of law are closely interconnected and one cannot exist without the other. I shall not revert again to the historic adoption of the post-2015 development agenda except to recall that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, speaking in San Francisco in June and commenting on the importance and scope of this universal programme, observed that we were the first generation that could put an end to poverty in the world and the last generation that could take action to prevent the worst consequences of a warming Earth.
That observation should cause us to renew our commitment to a better future for all, to show solidarity, to unite our forces, pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations. As we did when we reached agreement on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we must spare no effort to come together at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December, so that we can accept an ambitious and binding climate change agreement that applies to all countries and will keep the increase in global warming to below 2°C. As President of the European Council, Luxembourg will spare no effort to ensure that the Paris meeting will be a success. We must seize this historic opportunity.
Another priority project during Luxembourg’s presidency of the Council in which I will invest all my energies is that of migration. According to the data of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, today there are 59.5 million displaced persons, including refugees, or more than at any time since 1945, at the end of the Second World War. As the Secretary- General noted, the continuous flow of migrants and the surge of human misery bring us face to face with our responsibilities as political leaders, as members of the international community and, obviously, as human beings.
In times of crisis, unfortunately, various unilateral vague desires and nationalist or populist reflexes seem to reappear. We saw that happen again, tragically, in the summer. But no country can face the unprecedented crisis of migrants and refugees alone. Withdrawing into ourselves is not the answer. We must act together, as the countries of origin, transit and destination of migrants, and respond to the challenges posed by migrant movements in the Mediterranean, the Balkans
and elsewhere. Only if we firmly anchor our actions in respect for our international commitments, shall we find a solution worthy of our shared values, the values for which the United Nations and the European Union were founded.
At the level of the European Union we took a first step during the past week by deciding to relocate within the countries of the Union 120,000 people who clearly need international protection. Other decisions will follow shortly. The European Union will respond to the urgent needs of refugees by donating at least an additional €1 billion to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme and other such bodies. We will increase our assistance to Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey to deal with the Syrian refugee crisis. We will help Western Balkan countries deal with the flow of refugees, including through pre-accession instruments.
We cannot simply deal with the symptoms of the crisis. We must also tackle the root causes of migration and of refugee flows: development inequalities, especially in Africa; conflict and violence; the absence of the rule of law; persecution and violations of human rights; and impunity. That brings us back to the interconnectedness of security, development and respect for human rights and the need to adopt a comprehensive, integrated approach for the most effective application to development and migration of a combination of foreign policy, security, trade and cooperation instruments. The upcoming Valletta summit on migration on 11 and 12 November will provide an opportunity for us to discuss a comprehensive approach to the question of migration with our African partners, an opportunity which I welcome.
For more than four years, Syria has been synonymous with war, violence and exodus. One in six Syrians has now fled the country. One out of two has had to leave home. Every day 9,500 persons are added to the list of displaced persons. Every minute a family is forced to abandon everything. A whole of generation of children has been exposed to war, violence and death and deprived of fundamental freedoms, protection and education. More than 220,000 people have lost their lives. Indiscriminate aerial bombing, the release of barrel bombs, the acts of violence and the violations of human rights and international law continue unabated. The sieges continue. The denial of assistance and the obstruction of humanitarian assistance persist. Crimes
40/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
against humanity and war crimes are committed every day with impunity.
That cannot continue; it must be stopped. The situation is the Security Council’s responsibility and it is the responsibility of all of us. The solution to the Syrian conflict cannot be humanitarian, nor can it be military.
Today, the worst thing is the indiscriminate shelling in an undisciplined way and without prior coordination. The people are waiting for us to end the carnage rather than to make it worse.
A solution to the conflict can only be political. As we have said time and again, any lasting settlement requires a political transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people, in line with the Geneva communiqué (S/2012/522, annex). Words must be followed by actions. It is time for negotiations to finally begin. All of us must support Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura in his efforts. The fate of the Syrian people and the stability of Syria and of its neighbours within and beyond the region depend on it.
In that context, I will say a word on the destructive barbarism of the terrorist group Daesh and the urgent need to combat it. The tragic current situation in Syria, Iraq and Libya, and its repercussions in Europe, demonstrates that the international community must work together to stop the advance of Daesh. The day before yesterday, my country participated in a summit meeting organized by President Obama, which was the continuation of a discussion held in the Security Council one year ago (see S/PV.7272). The Assembly can continue to count on our country’s support in combating Daesh and violent extremism, whether in terms of preventing radicalization, exchanging intelligence, countering the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters or taking measures against terrorist financing.
I must mention another tragedy at the heart of the tumult in the Middle East, which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The year 2015 was sadly emblematic of the impasse of the peace process, which, at present, is only that in name. In an environment characterized by a total lack of prospects and the continuing cycle of revenge, the idea that there might be an alternative to the two- State solution is beginning to gain public support and to be applied on the ground. During my travels in the region last month, I was able to see that development for myself. But it involves an illusion, and perhaps a
very dangerous one. The two-State solution remains the only way forward. The conditions for that solution are obvious, both with respect to the 1967 borders and the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital of the two States.
The call to stop the settlements is not a matter of Israel-bashing, as it was described by the Prime Minister of Israel earlier today. Rather, it is a call to reason, to give the resumption of negotiations a chance. But to save the two-State solution, we must change our mindset. We must think outside the box. Now is no longer the time for efforts that lead nowhere. We must encourage a new negotiating format, broaden the circle of participants so that there is a greater involvement of Europe and especially of the Arab countries, reactivate the role of the Security Council and set a reasonable time frame within which to conclude the negotiations.
Israel has the right to live in peace and security, but it is clear to me that Israel’s security in the long and medium term will depend on the creation of a sovereign and democratic State of Palestine, living alongside it. The two-State solution is the only solution that is just and moral for both parties. As of yesterday, the Palestinian flag began to fly beside those of the States Members of the Organization. Let us all work to make it become more than just a symbol.
The comprehensive solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, which the E3+3 and the European Union reached after several years of negotiations with Iran, demonstrates that we should not lose faith in the power of diplomacy, even when tackling the thorniest of issues. The international community has made considerable efforts in those negotiations with Iran, which also serve the security interests of Israel. Let us be less fatalistic. Israel’s right to exist is not affected by that agreement. In fact, the opposite is the case. We believe that the full and rigorous implementation of the Joint Plan of Action, adopted on 14 July, will mark a fundamental turning point for peace and security in the region.
We could also say much more regarding other regions in the world, including Africa, as well as my own continent, Europe, where a conflict dating from another era started to affect Ukraine in February 2014 and is still ongoing. Thanks to substantial mediation efforts and commitment on the part of Germany, France and the European Union; thanks to close cooperation between regional and international organizations, first and foremost among them the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; and thanks to

the continuous monitoring of the United Nations, especially of the human rights situation in the Crimea and in eastern Ukraine, the foundations of a settlement of the crisis in Ukraine have been established in recent months. Commendable efforts have also been made with respect to regional autonomy and decentralization. The upcoming regional elections will be critical. It will be especially vital to hold them throughout the country and, therefore, in the Donbas region, under the authority of Ukrainian law. It is essential that each party fully respect the commitments entered into in the Minsk agreements.
When we talk of Ukraine, the Middle East, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Mali or Burkina Faso, there is one constant in all the situations, which is that diplomacy and the commitment to human rights and the rule of law must prevail, if we are to solve today’s profound crises. Our Secretary-General has fully risen to the challenge with the Human Rights Up Front initiative, firmly reminding us of our collective responsibility to protect and to place human rights at the centre of United Nations efforts to prevent conflict. To that end, all the actors and organs within the United Nations system must play their respective roles.
Allow me to focus on the particular role of the Security Council and its members. According to the Charter of the United Nations, the primary responsibility for maintaining peace and international security was conferred upon the Security Council to “ensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations”. The paralysis of the Council, when populations are threatened with horrific crimes, runs counter to the spirit of the Charter. That is why we welcome and support the initiative launched by France aimed at ensuring that the permanent members of the Security Council refrain from using the right of veto in cases of mass atrocities.
But beyond the permanent members, each of the Member States must assume its responsibility. Each one has its role to play, in working towards decisive action by the Security Council to prevent or halt mass atrocities. We therefore encourage all Member States to support the code of conduct as it relates to the action of the Security Council against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It will be officially launched on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. The same code of conduct has been developed by the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group, of which Luxembourg is a
member. The responsibility to protect must cease to be an abstract principle and become a concrete reality.
At 70 years of age, the United Nations must be able adapt in order to be up to the challenges it faces. On that account, we welcome the ongoing reviews that aim to make United Nations actions more efficient in its peacekeeping operations, peacebuilding or in the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), which recognizes women’s indispensable role in peace and security. Luxembourg will continue to engage with the numerous Member States that wish to push forward a reform of the United Nations. I am obviously thinking, in particular, about a reform that would make the Security Council more effective, transparent and representative of today’s world.
Let me conclude my remarks as I began them, with a quotation. This one is from Mahatma Gandhi. I understand it as an exhortation and a reminder of the responsibilities that we must shoulder, if we want to realize the dream of the creators of our Organization, which is the dream of a world of peace and dignity for all and the dream of a better world: “You must be the change you wish to see in the world”.
"
70,2015,GEO,"It is a great honour to once again address the General Assembly as we mark the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The occasion provides us with an opportunity to reflect on our accomplishments and to recognize the challenges that remain in achieving peace, security and human rights at home and abroad.
Georgia is a small country with a big heart and even bigger dreams. It is on the move and headed in the right direction. Our vision is clear and our future is bright. In a major announcement this week, the World Bank released its comprehensive new report on governance, and I am very proud to say that Georgia was at the top of the charts in overall progress in all six indicators. According to the rankings, since 2012 Georgia has jumped 13 places in regulatory quality, 16 in voice and accountability, 19 in the rule of law, 22 in political
15-29658 21/55

stability and in Government effectiveness, and 23 in controlling corruption. That dramatic progress underscores my Government’s determination to strengthen the rule of law and media freedom, build a modern economy and move our nation forward with confidence.
By contrast, just two decades ago Georgia was an isolated country torn by civil war, with few functioning institutions of modern statehood. Today we are writing a new chapter in the history of our great nation. Georgia is a modern, dynamic and democratic State. Next year, we will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of Georgia’s regaining its independence. Freedom, fairness and justice, as we say, run through the veins of our people. The Georgian people are committed to the rule of law, to the protection of human rights and to democratic values. We will stay the course on reform, which is the only road to peace and prosperity for our country.
We are moving our country forward in the same spirit that our ancestors embodied for thousands of years. Georgia has absorbed the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, principles that have guided our democratic development. We learned quickly and embraced passionately the spirit of international cooperation. So on behalf of all freedom- loving Georgians, I thank the United Nations and all free people around the world for their steadfast support of my country.
Today, Georgia is firmly connected to the world and the family of nations. We have dedicated ourselves to democracy, human rights, sustainable development and the promise of peace. We are building a mature democracy and a job-creating economy even in the face of significant regional security threats. The steady arc of our Euro-Atlantic path reflects Georgia’s strong European identity and values. European integration has proved to be a powerful incentive for calm cooperation among European States and their neighbours. We reached a milestone in June 2014, when I signed the Association Agreement with the European Union. As part of Europe, Georgia will become part of that fabric of peace and stability, which can only benefit our own neighbours, and I think it will make us more secure.
In the past few years, my Government and our country has made progress in every policy area. We have established a social compact that rewards work and enterprise while providing a social safety net for those in need. Despite challenging economic
headwinds, we have introduced a national health- care programme and doubled welfare services. In just one important initiative, we will save over 200,000 lives through a new and creative campaign to combat hepatitis C. We are solidifying Georgia’s democracy. Our people demand and deserve a strong democracy and a responsive Government. We have created a system of governance that is more open, more transparent and more accountable to the people than ever before. But we will not rest. More must be done.
The 2013 presidential election and the 2014 local elections were praised by international observers as free and fair. I am also proud of the fact that last year we adopted Georgia’s first comprehensive long-term human rights strategy and enacted a new anti-discrimination law. My Government strives to ensure human rights for all of our people. A free and open democracy goes hand in hand with a free and open marketplace.
Economic freedom remains the central pillar of our development plan. Our plan is designed to grow our economy, strengthen our institutions of governance and deliver more jobs and more opportunities for the Georgian people. We are driving growth by making Georgia a great place to do business and an attractive location for foreign investment. Since 2014, we have added 90,000 new jobs in Georgia, covering all sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, tourism and energy. Doing business in Georgia continues to be easy. Foreign and domestic businesses freely operate in a competitive environment with strong guarantees of private-property rights. The World Bank also ranks Georgia as the fifteenth easiest place to do business in the world. In 2014, Georgia achieved an 87 per cent surge in foreign direct investment (FDI), which is the largest growth in and highest amount of FDI since 2007.
Georgia has also become a major tourist destination and venue for international sporting events. The world is catching on to the fact that Georgia has it all — beautiful beaches and stunning mountain resorts, a gourmet tradition, exceptional wines, unique historical sites and world-class hospitality. In August, Tbilisi hosted two major sporting events, the European Youth Olympic Festival and the 2015 Union of European Football Associations Super Cup, which provided a unique opportunity to celebrate cooperation over conflict. Speaking of sports, I must take this opportunity to wish the Georgian national rugby team success as they face New Zealand tomorrow at the Rugby World Cup. Our nation is proud of them.

Another area of our national development is education. I personally know the value of a good education and studying abroad. I want Georgian youths to have that same opportunity. To that end, we launched a new programme where the Georgian Government will provide financial support for our students to study abroad. In return, they must come back home and put their skills to use in service to our country. For those hard-working Georgians who cannot travel abroad, we are bringing world-class education right to Georgia. I am proud to say we recently inaugurated a new programme in cooperation with the Millennium Challenge Corporation of the United States. Georgian students can now obtain a United States engineering degree from San Diego State University without leaving Georgia.
Even with all those achievements, we still face challenges to our security at home. I regret that since my last address to the United Nations (see A/69/PV.14), the Russian Federation signed the so-called integration treaties with Sukhumi and Tskhinvali. Russia continues to illegally extend its control over Georgian sovereign territory. I condemn that creeping annexation and Russia’s disregard for international law. A tragic result is that the local population in the occupied territories of Georgia are robbed of the fundamental rights of a free people. De facto authorities recently undertook additional measures to suppress still further the Georgians’ right to be educated in their mother tongue. The freedom of movement and the basic rights of a free nation are crushed, along with the hopes and dreams of hundreds of thousands of victims of ethnic cleansing who only wish to return to their places of origin.
I must once again underline the importance of resolution 69/286, on the status of internally displaced persons and refugees from Abkhazia, Georgia, and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, Georgia, and similar resolutions annually adopted by the General Assembly. The pain of the conflict is real. The dislocation is profound. Just since 2012, our Government has provided homes to approximately 10,000 internally displaced families from the occupied territories.
Against the backdrop of continued Russian occupation, my Government has nevertheless been clear on the need to forge responsible and pragmatic relations with the Russian Federation. To that end, we have taken a number of constructive, concrete steps to advance trade, transport, communication, humanitarian
contacts and tourism when and where possible with Russia.
Let me be clear. Relations with Russia cannot be settled at the expense of our sovereignty and territorial integrity. I hope that the Russian Federation will finally fulfil its international obligations, including the 12 August 2008 ceasefire agreement, and act as a responsible member of the international community. At the same time, I want to once again reaffirm our strong commitment to the peaceful resolution of the conflict, based on the fundamental principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.
Let me now address the Abkhazian and Ossetian peoples, my brothers and sisters. I firmly believe that no one will rewrite history and erase our common past. All attempts to cut off ties and divide our peoples will fail. We will benefit from a growing Georgian economy soon and from our Association Agreement with the European Union, including increasing trade and visa liberalization. We know that the arc of history favours more cooperation, more integration and more prosperity. When we work together, we all succeed and benefit. I look forward to the day when we will share in our mutual prosperity.
Despite those challenges, my country seeks to contribute to international peace, security, sustainable development and economic prosperity. Last year I had the honour of announcing Georgia’s intention to establish a Silk Road forum. Today, I am proud that the idea has materialized, and in a few weeks we will host the first-of-its-kind high-level forum in Tbilisi. My country’s location is at a key crossroads linking East with West. That was underscored this year when Georgia hosted both the annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the first meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The revitalization of the Silk Road is an important opportunity to ensure deeper economic and cultural ties between Asia and Europe. We are developing a strong economic and trade relationship with China, and I think the Silk Road region will open up new opportunities. That region accounts for two thirds of the world’s population and 60 per cent of its gross domestic product. I am convinced the Tbilisi Silk Road forum offers great potential to promote cooperation and regional integration.
I also want to comment on the recent P5+1 agreement reached with Iran. My country is hopeful
15-29658 23/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
that the process will develop in a positive direction and contribute to greater security and economic development in the wider region.
Georgia has repeatedly demonstrated its readiness to pay more than its fair share to promote a secure international environment. My country contributed the second-largest number of troops, after the United States, to the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. Our soldiers are among the world’s best. They are the pride of my nation, and we honour them. I would like to take a moment to remember all the brave Georgian troops who serve their nation and have given their lives in the pursuit of peace and freedom. My country’s contributions to our common security do not end there. Georgia also supports the European Union’s peacekeeping efforts, including providing the second- largest troop contribution to the European Union Military Advisory Mission in the Central African Republic.
A core element of Georgia’s security and its Euro- Atlantic integration is its ever-deepening relationship with NATO. Following last year’s NATO Summit, NATO agreed to provide Georgia a substantial package of practical support to strengthen Georgia’s armed forces and make us a more integrated ally. Most recently, we inaugurated a new joint training and evaluation centre in Georgia, where Georgian forces will receive NATO training. We are also increasing the number of training exercises carried out between Georgia and the United States and between Georgia and its NATO allies.
The Charter of the United Nations, adopted 70 years ago, was designed to put an end to chaos and to build a better world. Today, the world is still facing unprecedented challenges that require strong political resolve. Where necessary, we must reform international organizations to meet current demands. In that context, we commend the ongoing inter-State negotiations on Security Council reform, which aim at raising the effectiveness of the United Nations in crisis situations, as defined by the Charter. Increasing the role of small States in the Security Council, avoiding misuse of the veto rights, as well as improving the working methods, should be the cornerstone of the reform process. Thus I express hope that the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations will serve as a reminder to all of us to stand firmly for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and for the goal of peace and stability throughout the world.
In conclusion, let me end where I began. Our vision is clear and our future is bright. Let me share my dream for Georgia. I see a country where every young Georgian boy or girl has access to a quality education in order to give them the opportunity to develop their God-given talents. I see a country where people are free from the fear of not having the health care and resources they need to protect their family, livelihood and future. I see a strong, prosperous Georgia that leverages its geographic location as a vital crossroads connecting East and West, North and South. I see a strong and proud nation dedicated to facilitating peace among neighbours, as well as commerce between continents. I see a country that is a force for good and stability in its own neighbourhood, a country that lives up to its responsibilities as a global citizen.
Let us walk together in creating a brighter future for the next generations.
"
70,2015,QAT,"At the outset, I would like to extend my congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and to wish him every success. I also wish to express our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, for his efforts in conducting the Assembly’s business at that session. I wish also to avail myself of this occasion to commend the efforts made by His Excellency the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to achieve the goals of the United Nations.
It is gratifying that the United Nations has adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which we have supported, based on our belief that the good distribution of the fruits of development is a prerequisite for realizing social justice, preserving human dignity and enhancing the cohesion of communities, thereby enhancing security and stability in the world. Since there is no lasting stability without development and social justice, development is also clearly impossible where there is war and unrest. It was our hope that this session would be convened after some progress had been made with regard to the various bloody conflicts in our world, yet we find ourselves encountering increasing numbers of challenges and crises that threaten international peace and security.
The absence of international consensus has proved once again to be an obstacle to efforts to resolve important issues. Selectivity in choosing what efforts to make in enforcing justice and international law remains prevalent in dealing with regional issues. That compromises the concept of international legitimacy and the values, norms and principles that are rooted in the human conscience and have been adopted by the international community after millions of people paid an exorbitant price throughout history as a result of major humanitarian challenges that have taken an unforgettable toll on people, such as enslavement, genocide, colonialism, racism and world war. It is impermissible to tamper with the values that have grown out of the suffering of people. In a way, that is the raison d’être of the Organization, without which our annual meetings would be meaningless.
The conflict in the Middle East will continue to pose a permanent threat to international peace and security, given its direct impact on the numerous crises facing the region and the world. A just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine, which remains an issue involving a people perennially displaced from their land and still under the yoke of occupation, cannot be postponed to another generation. The achievement of a just and lasting settlement that brings an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and which establishes a Palestinian State requires an Israeli partner for peace. For the time being, there is no Israeli partner for a just peace or even for a settlement. In such circumstances, the international obligation to address the last de facto colonial issue in modern history cannot be shirked.
Until an end is put to occupation and procrastination and other delaying tactics, futile contacts and statements will continue. The feverish pace of settlement activity, despite its having been condemned, will continue, in addition to persistent violations of the sanctity of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This is a clear indication not only of the absence of Israel’s will to achieve peace, but also of the domination of ultra-Orthodox fundamentalist nationalist elements over Israeli policy. Look at what is happening in Jerusalem. Extremist religious political forces rely on literal interpretations of texts dating back thousands of years in order to desecrate other people’s holy sites and occupy and settle their land. Is this not tantamount to religious fundamentalism? Is this violence not an act of terrorism carried out by radical religious forces?
Permit me to address a message to all major actors of the international community: the continued failure to find a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question is a blot on the conscience of humankind. The international community is failing to find even a less than fair settlement; it has not even succeeded in achieving the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the aggression, even though an international conference based on a Norwegian initiative was convened specifically for this purpose. Qatar has pledged to pay $1 billion for the reconstruction process, and we are continuing to provide aid to the Gaza Strip in implementation of our commitment. But we wonder what happened to the conference and the decisions it took.
The international community, represented in the Security Council, is duty-bound to assume its responsibilities by taking a firm stance that would force Israel to comply with the deliverables of peace, namely, to halt all forms of settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territories; to lift the unjust siege of the Gaza Strip; and to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy that recognize the Palestinian people’s right to regain their legitimate national rights and establish an independent Palestinian State on the basis of the 1967 borders, in conformity with the principle of the two-State solution.
We caution against missed opportunities, because if people were to reach the conclusion that there is no peaceful solution to this issue, this would lead to unpredictable and dire consequences for the region and for the whole world.
The Syrian crisis, with all of its dimensions and repercussions, is having catastrophic consequences for the Middle East region and the world as a whole. The continued atrocities and horrendous crimes perpetrated by the regime against the Syrian people threaten the status of the State and its people and create a breeding ground for extremism and terrorism, under false religious, sectarian and ethnic pretexts, endangering humankind and the cultural heritage in Syria and the region.
In that context, the Syrian regime has manipulated the concept of terrorism by depicting peaceful demonstrations as terrorism, even as it has been committing actual acts of terrorism. When the shelling and killing of civilians drove people to take armed action, and when certain entities that are not committed to the demands and principles of the Syrian revolution entered into the sphere of political action without permission, Syria became a war zone. At that point, the regime attempted to instil fear into the international community as to the alternative.
It was incumbent on the international community to put an end to the massacres in a timely manner and create the conditions necessary for the Syrian people to devise a rational, civil and fair alternative to despotic rule. But is there a tyranny in the world that could acknowledge an alternative? Is it possible that a tyranny could allow an alternative to grow and develop under its shadow?
When a people suffer from war, genocide and displacement, the worst decision is not to take a decision at all, and the worst danger lies in ignoring danger. The failure of the international community to take the decisions and measures necessary to end this disaster is a major crime. It reveals the failure and the incapacity of the international system and has led to a loss of confidence in legality and the international community.
In this context, the role of the General Assembly must be promoted and strengthened as a broader framework for dealing with the issues facing peoples, given the inability or failure of the Security Council to find fair solutions thereto.
From this rostrum, I call for cooperation aimed at imposing a political solution in Syria that would end the reign of tyranny and replace it with a pluralistic regime based on equal citizenship for all Syrians; defeat radicalism and terrorism and insulate Syria therefrom;
repatriate the displaced to their homes; and allow for the reconstruction of Syria. The question is not whether this is possible; it will be possible if certain States have the necessary will.
The question is: is the continuation of the current situation in Syria possible? The conflict has morphed into genocide and caused the mass displacement of the population. This is having grave consequences for the region and the entire world, even for countries that are not working to expedite a solution because they are neither directly affected by the conflict nor reached by the influx of displaced people.
The handling at the international level of nuclear-disarmament issues, which is characterized by shortcomings and double standards, alarms us. Clear evidence of this is the recent failure of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to render the Middle East a nuclear-free zone; this was disappointing and has undermined the credibility of the Treaty.
The agreement between Iran and the P5+1 is a positive and important step. We hope that this nuclear agreement will contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in our region. We further wish to see the entire region rendered free of nuclear arms and weapons of mass destruction.
In this context, given the strategic importance of the Gulf region, the achievement of stability in the Gulf is essential to the countries of the region and the international community as a whole. In this regard, we emphasize our firm position that the Gulf region must be spared any dangers or threats related to nuclear weapons, and that there must be a recognition of the right of the countries of the region to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in accordance with the relevant international norms.
On this occasion, I wish to reiterate that Iran is an important neighbouring country and that cooperation between it and other countries is in the interest of the region.
Bilateral relations between Qatar and Iran are developing and evolving steadily on the basis of common interests and good-neighbourliness. There is no dispute concerning bilateral relations between our two countries. There are various creeds and religions in our region, but, in my opinion, there is no Shiite-Sunni conflict, only differences that are triggered by the political interests of countries or the interests of
political and social forces that foment internal sectarian prejudices.
I believe that existing disputes are political, regional Arab-Iranian differences rather than Sunni-Shiite disputes. These could be resolved through dialogue and by initially agreeing on the rules governing the relationship between Iran and the Gulf States on the basis of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. It is high time that a meaningful dialogue of this kind be conducted between countries that will always remain neighbours and are not in need of mediation from anyone. We are ready to host such a dialogue in Qatar.
We affirm our commitment to Yemen’s unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty, and we support the legitimacy of the political process and urge its completion in accordance with the Gulf initiative and its executive mechanism, the outcome of the Yemen National Dialogue Conference in January 2014, the Riyadh Declaration of May 2015 and the relevant Security Council resolutions, particularly resolution 2216 (2015). It is unreasonable to set the precedent whereby a major political party accepts the outcome of a national dialogue yet ignores it, seeking instead to impose its own vision and to dominate the entire country by force.
With respect to Iraqi, the stability of Iraq requires a general national consensus free from outside interferences and from sectarian and ethnic discrimination. We hope that the Iraqi Government will be able to fulfil the need for concord and reconciliation among the various Iraqi people’s factions. Experience in Iraq and Yemen has proved that the existence of militias operating outside the framework of legitimacy is not only a threat to the State by virtue of its inherent nature and its exclusive right to establish armed forces, but is also tantamount to a dormant civil war that could turn into full-blown domestic strife sooner or later. Any political solution in Iraq, Yemen, Syria or Libya must preclude the existence of militias outside the framework of legitimate State institutions. That is a key component of any genuine settlement, without which there can be neither a permanent settlement nor real solutions.
The political forces in our region must pay heed to the thousands of young people who recently took to the streets in more than one Arab country demanding that citizenship be the basis for partnership, and refusing to be represented on a sectarian basis and to accept that sectarian representation may be used to cover up
corruption. Nations and peoples face grave political, security and economic challenges from terrorism and its dire consequences. Tensions and conflicts have undoubtedly contributed to the emergence of terrorist organizations. The international community’s failure to address hotbeds of tension and conflict has also contributed to creating an environment that is friendly to terrorist operations.
Terrorism is rooted in radical ideas that brook no compromise with the actuality of people and their potential; it thrives in an atmosphere of despair and blocked prospects. Terrorism does not emerge in a society where policies guarantee its citizens a life of dignity and freedom. It arises in the shadow of tyranny and feeds on oppression and humiliation, feeds on grudges and hatred born of torture in prison, and exploits the loss of hope of peaceful political action.
Moreover, the behaviour of influential Powers in the international community distorts people’s perceptions rather than helping to provide clarifications. Some armed militias that commit crimes against civilians and public institutions are branded as terrorist, while others perpetrating violence and intimidation against civilians are not deemed terrorists due to considerations related not to the local communities themselves, but to international and regional Powers or to transitional alliances.
The rising toll of victims of terrorist operations has necessitated the use of military force to counter this phenomenon. We affirm our commitment to fighting terrorism, but even if the harshest conditions we should not ignore its underlying causes; if we do, the phenomenon will be exacerbated and spread even further. We highlight the fact that there is no faith that preaches terrorism. All religious texts contain ample teachings calling for peace, tolerance and coexistence, but the promoters and hucksters of literal readings of scripture ignore the fundamental religious teachings of noble values, tolerance, cooperation and constructive dialogue for the benefit of humankind. Simple people with their quintessential religiosity deem religion first and foremost to be a set of values and morals. That is what we must build on.
The State of Qatar has sought to pursue a progressive policy in the protection and promotion of human rights and pursues cooperation with international organizations through our membership in the Human Rights Council in order to consolidate the concepts and culture of human rights through an approach based on
the rule of law, transparency, justice and human dignity. We must work together to strengthen the collective security system in order to effectively deal with international and regional problems and to preserve the rights of peoples. We must resolutely counter any attempt to impose temporary solutions to address the side-effects of problems rather than targeting their roots.
Finally, the State of Qatar will spare no effort to support the international community’s efforts to achieve the goals that we all aspire to, commensurate with the interest of our peoples and the good of humanity.
"
70,2015,ZMB,"I would like to begin by thanking the Secretary-General and by expressing my gratitude for the convening of this important session, at which we mark the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I am confident that, coming as he does from the great country of Denmark, he will preside over our meetings with great success. I would also like to pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa of the Republic of Uganda for successfully presiding over the Assembly at its previous session.
I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to deliver my first address to this gathering of world leaders. I should recall that, almost a year ago, my country found itself at a crossroads following the demise, on 28 October 2014, of our fifth President, Mr. Michael Chilufya Sata — may his soul rest in peace. I was elected President of the Republic of Zambia in the subsequent election, which took place on 20 January. Building on my country’s impeccable record in the area of democracy and good governance, the election was described as transparent, peaceful, free and fair, reflecting our commitment to internationally accepted standards for peaceful changes of Government and popular participation in shaping a country’s destiny. I would therefore like to thank the people of Zambia for being true champions of democracy. As we meet today, I also feel duty bound to thank the international community for its unflinching solidarity during that very challenging time of the past year.
This year is an important one for the General Assembly, as we commemorate the 70 years of existence of the United Nations. In our deliberations, therefore, it is imperative that we take stock of the collective successes as well as the challenges of the past seven decades, in order to improve the performance of this noble Organization. I am optimistic that the seventieth session will set a tone for the future and meet the expectations of the international community
as a whole. Zambia is proud to be part of the global endeavour to foster the mandate of the United Nations to promote peace, security and respect for human rights and to ensure progress in development for all. We are concerned, however, that the gears for advancing the three pillars of the Charter of the United Nations are moving at a very slow pace, which has the potential to negate the gains we have achieved so far. It is therefore important that we enhance our concerted efforts to address areas of concern.
We have just adopted the world’s quintessential development blueprint in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), centred on humankind, the environment and the creation of peaceful societies. Those core elements will guide its implementation, supported by the principle of leaving no one behind. I have been encouraged by the focus on development that has characterized the global discourse in recent years, as the 2030 Agenda has evolved. The development lessons of the Millennium Development Goals and the cumulative experience of the 70 years of the United Nations should serve as a springboard for our ambitions. Let us therefore ensure the successful implementation and attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I am confident that the invaluable lessons learned will set us on a trajectory that must inevitably lead to a safer, more inclusive, cleaner and more prosperous world.
In the 70 years of the existence of the United Nations, the inequality gap among and between nations has continued to widen, as poverty and youth unemployment have threatened the prospects for peace, security and development. My Government looks forward to the comprehensive implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which promotes poverty eradication and the creation of employment opportunities for young people and women, especially in rural communities.
Over the past 70 years, the global community has become more united than ever before in its quest to push boundaries in order to attain peace and security; yet it is as divided as ever, if not more so, on the question of who makes decisions on global peace and security. The 70 years of the existence of the United Nations have seen more conflicts in Africa than on any other continent, and yet those 70 years have been characterized by Africa’s absolute exclusion from decision-making in the Security Council, despite the fact that a significant part of the Council’s agenda
12/26 15-29437

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17
concerns the African continent. In the 70 years of the existence of the United Nations, Africa remains the only continent not represented among the permanent members of the Security Council. Goal 10 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) on reducing inequality among countries will not be achieved without eradicating the inequality among countries in the Security Council. The United Nations must, therefore, redouble its efforts to implement Security Council reform in order to ensure that Africa can take its rightful place among the community of nations and contributes equitably and effectively to global peace and security.
Zambia has continued and will continue to offer its resources for peacekeeping, including the deployment earlier this year of a large contingent of troops to the Central African Republic. Zambia comes with a long history of involvement in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. As a landlocked country, our independence was incomplete as long as we remained surrounded by nations still fighting their liberation struggles. That gave impetus to our moral conviction to join in the liberation struggles in Africa. Since then, Zambia has continued to participate in peacebuilding initiatives and has supported peacekeeping efforts all around the world. We continue to share the global concerns at the unrelenting threats of terrorism, as it mostly affects the safety of non-combatants and civilian populations.
I have been encouraged by the focus on development that has characterized global discourse during the past year, notably through discussions on the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Zambia has been a beneficiary of various initiatives aimed at facilitating the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, which arose from the collective resolve of the generation of world leaders at the turn of the millennium. Indeed, most of our countries have continued to face serious challenges in the quest to foster development and improve the quality of life of our people. The challenges are numerous, including energy shortages and the effects of climate change. The two are inseparable on the development agenda for countries such as Zambia that rely heavily on hydropower generation.
The changing rainfall pattern has adversely affected power-generation capacities in most of our countries. This year, Zambia is experiencing an unprecedented energy crisis, which has already cost
the nation dearly in terms of productivity, jobs and revenue. Beyond the economic limitations, the social ramifications are equally devastating to the country. It is therefore important that much effort be exerted to develop mitigation strategies to counter the effects of climate change. Furthermore, developing countries are still grappling with other challenges, such as poverty, high unemployment — particularly among the youth — skewed industrial development, low intraregional trade, inadequate infrastructure, low productivity in agriculture and livestock, poor quality health services and the challenges of access to quality education.
As we move forward, it is important for us to acknowledge the realities and imperatives of the world today and to renew our common resolve to sustain the core principles of our Organization as the United Nations. We should redouble our efforts, by harnessing our individual strengths in order to collectively address the rather complex challenges that confront us in our increasingly globalized and interdependent world.
Given the demographic nature of our communities, poverty remains a real concern, particularly in rural areas. In Zambia, 70 per cent of the people in rural areas depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Agriculture is one of my Government’s priority areas in the county’s efforts to diversify the economy, apart from mining. The Government is therefore devising interventions aimed at improving capacities and adding value for both subsistence farmers and commercial farmers. Our interventions, notably the Farmer Input Support Programme, the Irrigation Development and Support Project, and other credit schemes, need additional support in order to exploit the full potential of that giant industry. We also seek to strengthen partnerships to enable the improvement of services in such areas as providing extension services, improving access to market information and facilitating the physical transfer of produce to markets.
A key element of Zambia’s development agenda is industrialization. In that regard, my Government has devised measures to encourage and support the development of appropriate industries, mainly in value-added industries, in order to spur structural economic transformation and increase private-sector participation. The primary focus in that area has been on areas with more backward and forward linkages so as to catapult the Zambian economy to higher levels of growth, leveraging regional value chains so as to

A/70/PV.17 29/09/2015
expand trade, attract foreign direct investment, create employment, reduce poverty, promote sustainable development and thereby empower our people.
Financing is one of the major challenges that faces developing countries. We need external resources to bridge the gap in the funds required to finance development projects. It is in that light that the United Nations third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa in July to develop strategies for financing development, was most welcome. The Conference recommended several measures meant to bridge the financing gap, including the need to exploit new sources of finance and improve tax administration systems, which would be supplemented by international support. We know that putting the appropriate infrastructure in place is very important in our quest to expand intra-Africa trade, bolster our productive capacities and enhance Africa’s competitiveness in the global market. In that regard, we must quickly identify sources to raise the $100 billion Africa needs annually to finance its infrastructure development.
It is equally important, from the perspective of landlocked developing countries, to remain committed to implementing the decisions of the 2014 Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024. In keeping with that commitment, Zambia was privileged to host a high-level meeting on the follow-up to the Second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries, held in Livingstone in June. I was honoured to officiate at the Conference and hope that the Assembly finds the time to review the outcome document, entitled “Livingstone Call for Action”.
Special attention should be paid to gender and women’s empowerment. The International Conference on Population and Development Beyond 2014 Global Review Report, published in June 2013, indicates that 35 per cent of women have been victims of gender- based violence. Indeed, Zambia acknowledges that the problem extends to most nations, including our own. To that end, we are already implementing important interventions to curb that scourge. Our approach to development will not be limited to the economy but will continue to focus on all pillars of development. I welcome the fact that our traditional leaders, the United Nations system and civil society have all been seamlessly working with Governments in fighting for gender equality for our women and girls.
One of the most important programmes, and one in which I have been engaged as a designated champion, is the “He For She” campaign, which seeks to address issues of gender-based violence. That project was initiated by UN-Women in September 2014 with the aim of addressing incidents of gender-based violence. In a few days, my Government will also launch the United States-supported “From Boys to Men” project, which targets the 15-to-21-year-old age group and is aimed at encouraging the development of a non-violent generation. In our determination to bridge the gap between the sexes, a vigorous campaign is under way to strengthen the education of girls by encouraging them to complete their schooling and unlock their developmental potential instead of being pushed into child-, early or forced marriages.
The situation of our young people remains daunting, with unemployment one of the major challenges they face. To address that situation, my Government recently launched a national youth policy that seeks to lay a foundation for interventions of various kinds aimed at supporting the development of a vibrant and productive generation. We hope to create 500,000 jobs over the next five years, an effort that will depend heavily on the private-sector-led job market. We are also making efforts to address the specific social disadvantages of the most marginalized members of our society, including the disabled. We want to ensure that they can realize their potential and serve in national development efforts in the same way as anyone else.
The challenges are many, but they are not insurmountable. The United Nations has been a key ally in addressing some of those problems, and indeed, to a large extent, the story of Zambia is the story of the United Nations. I am confident that through our concerted and collective efforts, determination and hard work, coupled with able and visionary leadership, we shall indeed overcome. I look forward to working with everyone here so as to ensure that our shared solutions are brought forward and implemented in the spirit of this Organization.
"
70,2015,NZL,"The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations is a good opportunity to reflect on the state of the Organization. For most of us, the United Nations has been one of the key international realities of our lives. It has been at the heart of what has shaped us in the significant developments of the post-Second World War era. But as we all know, it is not perfect. A lot can be said about the shortcomings of the United Nations. They are many and some are serious. But there are things this Organization can do that no other international body can. And it remains the key reference point for States when there is a problem. That is why New Zealand fought so hard for its current seat on the Security Council. We sought election because the Council is the primary body for the maintenance of international peace and security.
New Zealand is a small country at the bottom of the world. Despite being far from many of the world’s trouble spots, we are not immune to their consequences. This time last year, I pressed the case for New Zealand’s election to the Security Council. I would like to thank Member States for their faith in us. In the past nine months we have striven to repay them. Much of the debate in this Hall this week has been about where the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, has not performed. The conflicts and human suffering in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan and a long list of other countries show how far we are from achieving the aspirations of our founders and of today’s Members. So, too, does the lack of progress in bringing peace to the Middle East.
Since we have been on the Council, we have found it as hard as many of those here warned. The Council’s agenda is lengthy and contentious. The dynamics within it are difficult. When Council members work together, as they did over the recent agreement on Iran’s nuclear capability, they can still deliver on the Council’s role as it is set out in the Charter of the United Nations. The Iran deal was a notable bright spot this year. Although it was negotiated in Vienna, only the Council had the power to implement it. New Zealand is proud that this occurred during our presidency of the Council in July. Now, the deal has to be implemented and its example followed. That is because this important agreement must become the basis for something wider — a fundamental resetting of relationships and a foundation for the resolution of other regional conflicts.
Nowhere is the resetting of relationships needed more than in Syria. Syria has been torn apart by internal divisions and a leader prepared to wage war on his own people to cling to power. External actors, from within the region and beyond, have tried to tilt the balance in pursuit of their own interests. And as the country descended into lawlessness, the evil nightmare that is the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which first took hold in Syria, spread death and terror in the region and beyond. ISIL’s warped ideology and unprecedented use of social media to export its twisted message is a threat to all of us, even a country as distant as New Zealand.
That is why New Zealand has joined the international coalition against ISIL. We are doing what we can to help the victims of the Syrian conflict and combat the scourge of ISIL. New Zealand’s armed forces are helping the Government of Iraq to train its soldiers to
16/25 15-29664

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.23
defend its people. In response to the humanitarian crisis we are helping to fund programmes in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to assist their efforts to support thousands of displaced refugees. Like many other countries, we are implementing an emergency Syrian refugee resettlement programme.
None of that gets to the root of the problems in Syria. All Council members carry responsibility for ending the misery in Syria and beyond. The consequences of inaction are not theoretical. The human toll is real — a 3-year-old boy dead, washed up on a Turkish beach; hundreds of thousands killed and millions forced to flee their homes. We cannot ignore the huddled travellers in the railway stations of Europe or the reality of refugees scratching out a meagre existence in camps and makeshift homes in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. More than 160 leaders have shown up in New York this week to mark the enduring importance of the United Nations over the past 70 years. Yet we do so against the backdrop of the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.
Every one of us sees the harrowing images daily. At the same time we see the consequences of the Security Council’s failure to act over the past four years. It is time for the Council to step up. It is time for it to stop talking about what is right and do what is right. It is time for the Council to do the job for which it was created. It is time for its members to set aside their vested interests and historical alliances in order to stop the violence and end the suffering. It is time for the Council to do its duty by those who have lost their lives and loved ones and the millions who have been displaced. We cannot afford to let the Council go from an institution with failures to a failed institution.
There must be a political solution to the conflict in Syria. And it must come soon. It should address all issues and involve all relevant actors, from within the region and beyond. The question is not Al-Assad or ISIL. Both need to be dealt with. A workable political solution will not be a perfect one. Indeed, it is a classic case of the perfect being the enemy of the good. It will require international cooperation and compromise, on all sides.
The Council also needs to engage in making progress on the Middle East peace process. Since being elected to the Council, New Zealand has made clear its view that the status quo is unsustainable. It puts at risk the achievement of the two-State solution that we all know is the best hope for a lasting peace. That is a
matter of urgency and another critical issue on which the Security Council should lead. We are told that the conditions are not right on the ground and that the parties are not ready, but we should not let conditions on the ground dictate our actions, if our actions can help bring a solution.
We stood for the Council because we believe small States have a positive contribution to make, and we wanted to provide a voice for those who go unheard too often. It was for that latter reason that we arranged the first open debate on the peace and security challenges of small island developing States during our presidency in July (see S/PV.7499). We were heartened by the level of participation of both those States and the broader membership.
The challenge for a small elected member to have its voice heard and its views taken into account is considerable. Part of the problem is structural. That the five permanent members of the Council have the right of veto creates an extraordinary power imbalance. That imbalance is exacerbated by their practices of prenegotiating outcomes before engaging with the 10 elected members and of taking no action when one of the five does not agree. That experience has reaffirmed to us that New Zealand was right to oppose the right of veto when the Charter of the United Nations was being drafted.
It is still our view that the right of veto is a constraint on the effectiveness of the Council and realizing the aspirations of the States Members of the United Nations. For that reason, New Zealand supports the two proposals being put forward this year — by the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group of countries and by France and Mexico — to limit the use of the veto in mass atrocity situations. The fact that two permanent members are supportive represents progress, but part of the problem is also behavioural. The permanent members have become used to exercising power and are protective of their privileged position. They presume to control the Council’s agenda and to determine its processes. Despite that, we are doing what we can to ensure that the elected members have the information and the opportunity to contribute effectively to Council decision-making. And, in turn, that it makes effective decisions.
We want to contribute to a Council that is genuinely focused on finding practical solutions to political problems and not on preserving the status quo. We are well aware that the conflicts on the Council’s agenda
15-29664 17/25

A/70/PV.23 01/10/2015
are complex and not easily solved, but we are realistic in our expectations of what can be achieved. New Zealand believes that the body responsible for maintaining international peace and security has a responsibility to find solutions to the world’s most pressing crises.
Only the United Nations and its agencies have the capacity to focus world attention across a range of issues. That was demonstrated last week with the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals. We sincerely hope that the Conference of the Parties will be similarly successful in Paris in December, with the adoption of a meaningful agreement on climate change.
Healthy and productive oceans are a key requirement for a sustainable future. I was pleased to announce earlier this week the creation of a marine sanctuary around New Zealand’s Kermadec Islands. The Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary will comprise 620,000 square kilometres of ocean in one of the most pristine and special environments on Earth. The Sanctuary will be one of the world’s largest and most significant fully protected marine areas. It will cover an area twice the size of our land mass and better protect the habitats of a huge array of sea creatures.
New Zealand is committed to managing our oceans responsibly, and we are working with our Pacific neighbours to do the same. We have committed $1 billion in development assistance to the Pacific, focused on, among other things, helping support sustainable fisheries management. Our aid is focused on our region and in areas where we know we can get real results for real people, improving livelihoods and creating opportunities. Many Governments around the world are doing the same, and we are proud to play our part.
As I prepare to leave New York, I do so proud of the contribution that New Zealand has made to the sustainable development of our oceans. I leave proud of the contribution New Zealand is making on the Security Council and proud of the values and principles that underpin the country I lead. I also leave dispirited by the Security Council’s failure to help not only the people of Syria, but those in so many other countries. The collective effort of the Security Council, supported by the broader membership, could make a real difference.
I think all of us who have been here over the past week know that collective action must start somewhere. It should start at the United Nations.
"
70,2015,BEN,"The Organization turns 70 this year, and on this birthday we welcome its call for a “Strong United Nations, Better World”. This celebration is an opportunity to welcome and take stock of all the progress made in promoting the fundamental principles of the Charter. The goals and ideals of the Organization today face a globalized and often dangerous world that is experiencing a turbulent time in its history. We are in a multipolar world. Climate change has become tangible in terms of its harmful effects, especially on the least developed countries. Fortunately, there is public opinion and there are peoples with aspirations for a prosperous, long-term future who know how to achieve it.
I commend the President of the General Assembly on his personal qualities. His country, Denmark, where he is a senior leader, continues to be very close to countries such as our own. He is an excellent Ambassador to the United Nations and of the international community’s resolve to stand in solidarity.
I also wish to pay tribute to the outgoing President of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa from the brother country of Uganda. His personal qualities allowed undeniable progress to be made and strong consensus to be reached on important issues. I pay tribute to him together with the current President.
When it comes to peace, security and human rights — the themes of this seventieth general debate — we are certain that considerable progress has
12/28 15-29701

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21
been made but it is still possible to go further. That is what we want to discuss. Yes, our world has made considerable progress, but the threat of terrorism has been mentioned many times from this rostrum. Just a few minutes ago, we heard about its prevalence in Iraq, but we also know it from our own experience in Africa. There is strong financial instability and crises in Africa — food crises, energy crises, mass youth unemployment — that are affecting the youngest and the oldest in all countries. There are pandemics, that other globalization of the day. There are the rising sea levels and coastal erosion that we feel as a coastal country.
Clearly everyone has their own challenges, but the United Nations system is at the front line and we are proud and confident in the United Nations action. We also have problems that run deep in all our countries concerning good governance, which sometimes poses major obstacles to development policies and good responses to the challenges of the day. They need to be addressed.
The Addis Ababa Action Agenda opens new possibilities of cooperation for Africa in combating the vast international corruption that is hitting us hard with mass tax evasion and illicit financial flows. The struggle against such corruption requires a coordinated judicial effort. We need to counter its harmful, far- reaching effects. It is an obstacle to growth and to investment. We must deny the perpetrators of economic and financial crimes the possibility of taking refuge in the sanctuaries of tax havens. We are pleased that the United Nations system, working with the Group of 20, is coordinating with the full commitment of the African Union to combat this corruption.
But in each of our countries, we know that corruption at the domestic level is also a very important hindrance. Benin has decided to address it and attack it using institutional means by establishing, through a law enacted in 2011, an effective national authority for combating corruption, and in 2015 a general audit office designed to improve administrative practices. With the help of its technical and financial partners and the United Nations system, which has been very vigilant and very effective, Benin seeks justice to find better means to prosecute and eradicate the impunity that often goes with corruption at the domestic level, even in the institutions of the Republic itself.
If we look at things more broadly, we hope that the United Nations, which has helped us in all these subjects, will be ever more effective in conflict resolution. No State, powerful though it may be, can prevent or resolve conflict alone. On our continent, the security issue is ever present. It is a serious obstacle to the development of the countries in the grip of these conflicts. Often it is a reflection on our borders and our territory of conflicts that in reality are cross-border in nature. They are often linked to religious fundamentalism, all kinds of terrorism, human trafficking, drug smuggling, and maritime piracy.
Africa knows these problems. Africa is getting organized but needs the help of the rest of the world. We still need security assistance, which is a primary and critical priority component of development assistance. Our country advocates a comprehensive approach to cooperation among States that is political, economic, legal and diplomatic. We find that such assistance is making solid progress, especially among African countries or between Africa and other continents, with the United Nations system as guarantor and stakeholder.
Similarly, we wish to stand in solidarity and also be an actor. It will be noted that in recent years Africa has increasingly been a key actor in the prevention and resolution of conflicts. I must apologize today for the absence at this General Assembly of the President of the Republic of Benin, Mr. Thomas Boni Yayi, who left a few hours ago. In his capacity as a mediator for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), he was summoned to finish mediating the internal conflict in Burkina Faso and to help the people of that country in their quest to resolve their internal problems. The President is on his way, ever the optimistic.
That is one example of what we can do, but we also contribute to the task force constituted by the brother countries of Nigeria, the Niger, Cameroon and Chad to fight Boko Haram together in a resolute manner. Eight hundred Beninese soldiers, many of them trained for action and intervention as part of United Nations peacekeeping operations, shall take their place beside to their sisters and brothers in arms.
Conflict prevention is very important. Let me highlight an initiative that the United Nations has strongly supported. We met in Cotonou from 26 to 28 May at a symposium on education for peace and interreligious dialogue. We have the opportunity as
15-29701 13/28

A/70/PV.21 30/09/2015
a people to be a nation of peaceful and constructive coexistence for development among our traditional religions and the religions of the Book. That symposium led to the adoption of a manifesto that proposes ways forward to create this harmony and determination to live together that are key elements in preventing future conflicts and threats. I should like to thank the United Nations for its support and call on the international community to draw inspiration from and substantively assist us in following up on this reflection on interreligious dialogue with its roots in African soil.
The President of the Republic of Benin was the driving force behind the coordination of the offer to provide the least developed countries with the services of the Secretary-General. in that regard, I thank the Organization and especially the Secretary-General for their assistance. We have thus been able to improve the plight of the least developed countries. Here, too, it is vital that, in the historic adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, our least developed countries received a certain number of very strong commitments in economic development, earmarked to their specific cases.
In terms of the way the United Nations is evolving, let me just say that Benin is very attached to seeing ever-stronger cooperation with the African institutions. When the President of the Republic of Benin assumed the presidency of the African Union in 2012, we saw in the situation in Mali how perfect coordination between the United Nations and the African Union, with the assistance of ECOWAS, yielded favourable results in terms of stabilization and appeasing an eminently dangerous situation.
Institutionalizing relations between the African Union Peace and Security Council and the United Nations Security Council is obviously a goal that we want to see pursued effectively. In speaking of the Security Council, we clearly share the African position which seeks to remedy the historic injustice of Africa’s lack of representation among the permanent members of the Security Council, and sometimes on the Security Council in any guise.
If the Security Council wants to be effective, it is hard to leave more than 1 billion people, who will become 2 billion people in the space of a generation, outside the Council. It is hard to remain committed to privileges dating back to 1945. Those opposed to equitable representation of Member States within the
Security Council need to use the fact that we have entered our seventy-first year to truly modernize the Council. It will make it more effective given the major contemporary political problems before us.
In that respect I should like to say that we believe that major progress has been made on a number of subjects on which we need to move forward on further. We welcome the call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, a fully-fledged State Member, living in good relations with its neighbours, Israel. We are convinced that this would create an impetus to ease tensions in that part of the world so that we could then declare the Middle East a nuclear- weapon-free zone the next day.
But we were also very encouraged by the negotiations that ended on 14 July 2015 in Vienna with the resolution of what could have been a very grave conflict, which saw the Islamic Republic of Iran and the five permanent members of the Security Council plus one reaching an agreement on the nuclear issue that maintains the possibility of the peaceful use of nuclear energy for the welfare and well-being of the people while at the same time avoiding the considerable risks that were crystallizing.
We also noted with emotion during this session of the General Assembly to see we are moving towards a complete lifting of the United States embargo on Cuba and the progress made. We want to commend both President Raul Castro Ruz and President Barack Obama for their spectacular courage in being able to wipe the slate clean and being able to build a future of hope for the two peoples. It is vital, and the whole world should benefit from it.
I should like to conclude by returning to the question of good governance and combating corruption. The post-2015 agenda is very demanding, and that is as it should be. With a country like Benin, a least developed country, what we have to do in 15 years is something that humankind has never done. There will be more than 150 million new inhabitants in a few years in Africa, with all that means in terms of the balance of our ecosystems, social equilibrium, needs for education, and for infrastructure in terms of urbanization. What lies ahead, no one has ever done. The goals that we are proposing no one has ever proposed. That is a considerable step forward, and the success of the Millennium Development Goals in many countries and in our own from — all the people — ensured
14/28 15-29701

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21
that significant progress was made on all of them. In Bangladesh they achieved all the goals. That is an extraordinary feat and is rather dizzying because it now faces something even more demanding. We will need all the aid from the international community, but we ourselves will need to draw on our own strengths and the best possible governance.
The President of the Republic of Benin is coming to the end of his two constitutional mandates, in compliance with the Constitution. He is ensuring that the elections to take place six months’ time in Benin will follow the example for all previous elections, just like the last two at municipal legislative levels that have just taken place. The democratic changeovers that the country has seen over the past five years should once again be marked with success and dignity.
We are but a small example, but an example of democracy and of governance that knows its limits and shortcomings but is getting better. We are an example of democracy for Africa, and we think that today that is the primary ingredient of any successful development policy given the challenges that lies ahead. We seek to be there in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.
"
70,2015,THA,"On behalf of the Royal Thai Government, I should like to join other leaders in expressing my warm congratulations to the United Nations on the occasion of its seventieth anniversary.
I wish to sincerely thank all countries for their expressions of condolence and solidarity in the aftermath of the bombing in Bangkok on 17 August. Thailand strongly condemns this barbaric act, which took the lives of many innocent civilians. We will never condone such violence. Let me therefore pledge our firm and unwavering determination to work with all countries to uphold peace and stability everywhere.
During the past 70 years, the United Nations has made significant contributions to alleviating the plight and problems of peoples in all four corners of the globe, playing a pivotal role in maintaining peace and security, protecting and promoting human rights and advancing the welfare and well-being of all humankind.
15-29595 5/23

A/70/PV.18 29/09/2015
In the area of peacekeeping, the United Nations has been recognized for its success in preventing armed conflicts from escalating into war. Nevertheless, the United Nations remains duty-bound to shoulder a heavy humanitarian burden and build sustainable peace, which means continuing to carry out development work and assisting people on the ground. Thailand is determined to provide support to United Nations peacekeeping operations, especially in the area of development.
In the area of human rights Thailand has always accorded priority to protecting and promoting the human rights of all groups of people. We proudly served as a member of the Human Rights Council from 2010 to 2013 and as its Chair from 2010 to 2011. During our tenure we advocated ourselves as a bridge-builder among nations and groups of nations with diverging views and ideologies. We uphold the principle of non-discrimination and constructive partnerships, as well as capacity-building of individual nations in their human rights promotion and protection efforts.
In the area of development, the United Nations deserves credit for bringing progress and prosperity to all Member States. Thailand is proud to be a part of this transformative world agenda, which places people at the centre of development in order to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities, ensure universal health and well-being, promote good governance and the rule of law, and reduce disaster risks. Climate change will pose a major challenge to the achievement of various Sustainable Development Goals. It is therefore our shared responsibility to ensure that the outcome of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will be both ambitious and viable.
We live in a borderless world marked by a complex interlinkage of problems, and solving them will require a comprehensive approach because we cannot rely on a one-size-fits-all solution. And since each country’s circumstances are different, there ought to be different approaches to addressing common global challenges. Today, close international cooperation and enhanced partnerships are indispensable to tackling the problem of irregular migration, especially persons displaced by conflict, which has created protracted humanitarian crises in many parts of the world. Thailand is also facing this challenge, and we reaffirm our commitment to work closely with all to address this pressing issue.
The United Nations at 70 has a commendable track record in the maintenance of peace and security and
the prevention of human rights abuses. Nevertheless, numerous challenges remain and require a holistic approach, focusing especially on the development dimension. The imperative now is to focus on crafting a truly sustainable solution to peace and security, taking into account the nexus of development and human rights.
Thailand’s socioeconomic success of the past three decades, its ascent to the rank of middle-income country, and its status as a partner for development, owes a great deal to the sufficiency economy philosophy of His Majesty the King of Thailand. Thailand’s approach to development takes inspiration from His Majesty the King’s sufficiency economy philosophy, which espouses moderation, prudence and resilience. It teaches people to be moral, wise and self-reliant and to live modestly and in harmony with society and nature. This people-centred development is indeed consonant with the United Nations new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). His Majesty the King’s sufficiency economy philosophy has been recognized internationally. In 2006, His Majesty the King was awarded the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award.
The strategy underpinning my Government’s approach to national development inspired by His Majesty the King’s philosophy is to make the country stable, prosperous and sustainable. The goals include reducing disparity and inequality, promoting the rule of law and good governance, fostering national unity, enhancing economic connectivity with our neighbours and pursuing development that would not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Security and stability, allowing people to live free from fear and free from want, are top priorities for my country, and it is my conviction that Thailand will be stable only when we have developed ourselves into a nation of virtuous, competent and enlightened citizens who live their lives responsibly and for the greater good. The Government has a role to play in the promotion of such a society, in which individuals actively take part in building a stronger and better future for themselves and for the community so that they can be resilient enough to cope with future challenges.
Climate change is a major challenge, and all countries must cooperate to manage the challenge it poses. Thailand reaffirms its commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by between 20 and 25 per
6/23 15-29595

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18
cent by the year 2030, in line with our commitment under the intended nationally determined contributions. Furthermore, sustainability can be achieved only when we put in place a framework of fair rules for all and promote good governance that in turn leads to greater transparency and accountability. We will stress joint ownership and the collective efforts of all across all sectors because people are the main agents of change, and that change must begin from within.
Thailand is therefore undertaking comprehensive reforms on several fronts to make our country stronger and better in the hope that we will achieve security, prosperity and sustainability, and pave the way towards resilient democracy. Some of these major reforms include amending laws and strengthening the justice system, and improving public-sector efficiency. What we do today will become history tomorrow. Therefore, we must make the best of today so that 10 or 20 years from now we will be remembered for our actions. We want Thailand to be stronger and better and to become more actively involved in the work of the United Nations to shape a brighter future for us all.
We often expect the strongest to help the weakest and the most vulnerable, but given the widening gap between the strongest and the weakest we must not overlook what those in the middle can do. This middle group of countries actually constitutes the majority. They may be strong enough to stand on their own feet while still remaining in touch with the instructive experiences of their growth and development. Therefore they can serve as a crucial link between the strongest and the weakest.
As a middle-income country, Thailand firmly believes that development cannot be truly sustainable when some countries forge ahead and leave others behind. That is why we have pursued the “Thailand- Plus-One” policy for all-inclusive, region-wide economic and industrial development, so that our neighbours can advance alongside us. This includes projects of transport connectivity and the creation of special economic zones along our borders with our neighbours in support of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
At present, the majority of people in developing countries are in the agricultural sector. They currently face a host of challenges, such as trade barriers, competition on the world market, climate change, debt, poverty and a diminishing workforce. All these challenges put the world’s food security at risk.
Therefore, we must join hands to help developing countries, particularly through North-South and South- South cooperation and by strengthening the agricultural sector.
Aside from looking after our farmers, we must also empower other vulnerable groups, such as women, children and the disabled, and those at risk of having their human rights violated and becoming victims of human trafficking, such as workers in the fisheries sector. The Thai Government accords priority to solving the problem of human trafficking because it is a serious violation of human rights and necessitates humanitarian assistance. The comprehensive efforts that we are now undertaking in the areas of prevention, suppression and rehabilitation will contribute to regional and global efforts to tackle this problem.
As regards other major transnational challenges, such as pandemics and drug trafficking, these are issues that require enhanced international cooperation. Thailand stands ready to share our experiences and best practices in areas where we have expertise, namely universal health coverage, infectious disease surveillance and sustainable alternative development. In a few months, we will be organizing the second High-Level International Conference on Alternative Development.
Thailand attaches importance to building a culture of peace. We have also actively participated in the international efforts to address global challenges. It is for these reasons that Thailand has decided to run for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term 2017-2018. We believe that we can constructively serve as a bridge-builder among Security Council members and non-members. We believe that we can play a constructive role in bridging different cultures and beliefs. In undertaking this important responsibility, we hope to be able to promote good understanding and enhance international cooperation in our collective endeavour to achieve the common goals of the United Nations.
As we enter a new era of development, the concept of sustainability should be integrated into all three pillars of the United Nations work. We have been emphasizing for decades how these three pillars are mutually reinforcing, but in reality we have been taking somewhat of a silo approach to peace and security, to development and to human rights. It is time to change all that. Now is the time to converge all three paths so that the road ahead for humanity in the next 70 years will be
15-29595 7/23

A/70/PV.18 29/09/2015
one of promises fulfilled, of visions transformed. Let us make it happen together now and let us turn our road into one that makes a difference.
It is our firm conviction that together we, the States Members of the United Nations, hold the power to change the world for the better. I hereby reaffirm Thailand’s readiness to partner with all Member States in our continuing efforts to address both traditional and non-traditional challenges. We are indeed united in our aspiration to make the United Nations a true beacon of hope for humankind.

70,2015,VAT,"Echoing the sentiments of Pope Francis, who recently visited the United Nations, I wish to renew the congratulations of the Holy See to Mr. Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I also wish to greet each of the participants in today’s meeting and to express my hope that its work will prove fruitful and give new impetus to the commitment for creating a world of peace and security, the respect for human rights and the promotion of the necessary conditions for integral human development. Significantly, on 24 October, we will celebrate the entry into force of the Charter of the United Nations.
The recently concluded summit of the Heads of State and of Government adopted a plan of action for the prosperity of peoples and the planet and for strengthening peace in greater freedom. In the General Assembly’s adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), it has undertaken the task of proposing a stable and sustainable pace for the world economy. The Holy See can only express
its satisfaction, as must the Governments that took part in the process of drawing up the new Agenda for their citizens. In that regard, I wish to mention that, even before the completion of the negotiations, Pope Francis stated that the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is an important sign of hope for humankind.
In contrast to the promising hopes generated by the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (resolution 69/313, annex), adopted at the third International Conference on Financing for Development, there is the sad panorama of war. It is obvious that, unless conflicts are properly resolved, all efforts to overcome poverty will fail. The Holy See is therefore seriously concerned about the global consequences of conflicts; above all, it expresses deep regret for the countless victims of those wars and joins its voice to the plea of all those who suffer.
We must acknowledge that, over the past 70 years, the United Nations has succeeded in avoiding a great global conflict and the outbreak of many wars between Member States. At the same time, it has also halted or resolved many regional conflicts and complex instances of civil war. Nonetheless, there are at present at least 50 conflicts or situations of latent conflict, to say nothing of the actions of international terrorist and criminal organizations set up as quasi-States and as a sort of alternative international community. We have before us, unfortunately, the immense tragedy of the war in Syria with its thousands of dead, its millions of displaced persons and its tremendous consequences for the stability of the region.

A/70/PV.27 02/10/2015
Similarly, the troubles in Libya, Central Africa, the Great Lakes region and South Sudan must remain at the centre of the international community’s attention. Nor can the tragic situation in Ukraine be overlooked or many other smaller or more contained conflicts, violations of humanitarian law or the atypical warfare waged by drug traffickers and other criminal groups. Then there is the grave conflict in the Middle East, which has been going on since the first years of the United Nations. That region, a cradle of civilizations, is immersed in a situation that combines every form of conflict and every possible subject — State and non-State combatants, ethnic and cultural groups, terrorism, criminality and so on.
The atrocities and unspeakable human rights violations that characterize today’s conflicts are transmitted live by the media, and with wide diffusion and repetition they risk generating a numbing familiarity and indifference. The international community, for its part, must feel a grave responsibility to act resolutely and renew its political and juridical structures, so as to limit and overcome, as quickly and effectively as possible, the consequences of the current war-related crises.
It is a bitter irony that the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations is accompanied by an exodus of peoples that is the greatest such migration seen since that caused by the Second World War. Entire populations are being displaced, as they flee from war, persecution, exploitation and poverty. Sadly, however, those waves of migrants are seen more in terms of the additional burden of unforeseen problems that they cause for the countries of passage or destination than in terms of the cost of human life paid by millions of innocent people. Furthermore, as a response to such mass migrations, the fear of terrorism and other local problems, there has been a return to the practice of building walls and barriers between peoples. That is a sad example of inhumanity, a hasty and ineffective solution to security and one that we thought the events of the late 1980s had definitively consigned to oblivion.
At the same time, the Holy See urgently appeals to States to overcome every form of nationalistic self- interest and, above all, to recognize the unity of our human family and to have faith in the human person. Distant and more recent history teaches us that migrants, even in the most dramatic situations of displacement, have always made a positive contribution to their host countries. More importantly, however, the migrants are
women and men who, by virtue of their humanity, are entitled to the universal rights to life and dignity.
In addition to offering hospitality, the present dramatic situation urgently demands a commitment to address the causes that force peoples to flee and thereby to take real, effective and generous decisions in favour of peace and integral human development. The solemn commitment to implement the 2030 Agenda is more timely than ever and must be advanced with courage. At the same time, we must recognize that, without peace between peoples and nations, it will be impossible to implement that Agenda.
To that end, the Holy See wishes to suggest four areas of reflection that should be borne in mind when considering the best possible course. They are the responsibility to protect, the respect for international law, disarmament and the protection of the environment. The first two, the responsibilities to protect and to observe existing international law are to be considered necessary instruments for discharging the immediate obligation to welcome exiles without putting up unjust barriers for the universal enactment of the 2030 Agenda, and likewise for the protection of the environment.
Today, the principle of the responsibility to protect all peoples from massive atrocities, instances of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity is recognized and accepted by all. That responsibility, as has been noted, first obliges national Governments, and then the international community and regional groups of States, to act in accordance with international law. Yet it is not always easy to carry out that duty in practice, not the least because its observance often conflicts with a strict literal interpretation of the principle of non-intervention, as sanctioned by paragraph 7 of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations. There is also the suspicion, historically founded, that under the guise of humanitarian intervention, the principle of the sovereign equality of the Members of the United Nations, established in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Charter, could end up being overridden.
Nonetheless, owing to the unacceptable human costs of inaction, the search for effective juridical means for the practical application of the principle of the responsibility to protect must be one of the most urgent central priorities of the United Nations. To that end, it would be most useful if the Member States could determine clear and effective criteria for applying
2/18 15-29940

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27
the principle and for the corresponding integration of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Furthermore, drawing on the significant experience of the United Nations and various dependent agencies in peacekeeping, peacebuilding and other humanitarian interventions, rapid and effective means should be found for implementing eventual decisions relative to the responsibility to protect.
The great purposes and principles expressed in the Preamble and in Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations serve as a sure guide to the interpretation and application of all successive provisions of the Charter. Therefore, the solemn duties spelled out in the Preamble “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” and “to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person” and in paragraph 3 of Article 1, to promote and encourage “respect for human rights and for fundamental freedom for all” not only justify the implementation of the responsibility to protect, but also bind the international community in the duty to find the appropriate means to do so. Otherwise, the great edifice of the Charter of the United Nations would be reduced to a mere tool for maintaining global equilibrium and for resolving controversies. That would betray not only those who drafted the Charter, but also the millions of victims whose blood was shed in the great wars of the last century.
The second element that today’s conflicts, and the humanitarian crises they cause, force us to consider is what we might call the responsibility to observe the existing law in responding to global and regional crises. That requires, first of all, a genuine and transparent application of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations. The principle of non-intervention, sanctioned in paragraph 7 of that Article, together with paragraphs 3 and 4, excludes all unilateral use of force against another Member of the United Nations and demands full respect for Governments that are lawfully constituted and recognized.
Article 2 cannot, however, become an alibi for excusing gross violations of human rights. The 70- year experience of the United Nations has amply demonstrated that grave violations of human dignity on the part of Governments can be redressed and resolved peacefully through denunciation and persuasion by civil society and Governments themselves. Where gross violations of human rights persist and further intervention is considered necessary, the only other
recourse is to apply the measures set forth in Chapters VI and VII of the Charter. In addition, adherence to the Charter, as well as to the cardinal principle of international law, namely, pacta sunt servanda, which is no tautology but rather the affirmation of the rule of law itself, has definitively banned concepts such as that of preventive war and, even more so, attempts to redesign entire geographic areas and redistribute populations under the pretext of a principle of security. At the same time, the most evident and reasonable understanding of paragraph 4 of Article 2 of the Charter excludes any intervention by third-party States in favour of one side or another in a situation of civil conflict.
A serious examination of conscience is needed, so that we can accept responsibility for the role that certain unilateral interventions have played in the humanitarian crisis that is causing so much hurt in our world today. As Pope Francis recently said,
“[W]e do not lack for hard evidence of the negative consequences of military and political interventions undertaken without coordination among the members of the international community.” (A/70/PV.3, p. 5)
The current crisis calls us, therefore, to renew efforts to apply the law that is in force and to develop new norms that are also aimed at combating the phenomenon of international terrorism, in full respect for the law.
Multilateral action for peace and collective security can be effectively advanced with the help of another instrument recognized by the Charter and often considered in the Assembly, namely, disarmament. Here, too, we find ourselves in an area of light and shadows, with the latter, unfortunately, prevailing. There is the telling example of the failure in May of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In view of that impasse, it is all the more important that the international community and the individual States most involved clearly signal a real desire to pursue the shared objective of a world free of nuclear arms, in full application of the Treaty, in letter and spirit, with the goal of a complete prohibition of such weapons.
As Pope Francis has noted in various forums, nuclear deterrence and the threat of mutually assured destruction are irreconcilable with and contrary to an ethic of fraternity and peaceful coexistence between peoples and between States. In the final analysis, the nuclear arms race, and indeed the arms race in
15-29940 3/18

A/70/PV.27 02/10/2015
general, with its expenditure of human and economic resources, is based on a denial of the human dignity of one’s potential enemies and even the denial of one’s own dignity and survival. A process aimed at a deeper understanding of the grave humanitarian effects of the use of weapons of mass destruction, and nuclear arms in particular, should therefore not only be encouraged but should be considered necessary.
With regard to the humanitarian dimension, I should also mention the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention and the Convention on Cluster Munitions, two instruments for disarmament and for adapting humanitarian law to the complexities of today’s world. They are aimed at stigmatizing and banning those dreadful ordnances, which have such a devastating and indiscriminate impact on civilian populations. The Holy See joins all those who are working for their effective implementation in expressing the hope that they will soon be signed by those States that have not yet done so.
Effective and full enactment of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations calls for replacing a mindset of thr rejection of others, of distrust and fear, with an ethic of responsibility. That, too, demands that we reflect on the meaning of the concept of collective security, which has to do not only with war and military actions but also with broader economic, financial, ethical, social and humanitarian dimensions.
Looking ahead, we see another grave responsibility, both for the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda and for peace itself. That is the hoped-for agreement on climate change, which is to be adopted at the Paris Conference in December. The climate is a global common good, a responsibility that we all bear, particularly towards the most vulnerable groups of present and future generations. It is a responsibility that is necessarily transversal, requiring effective multilateral and interdisciplinary cooperation on the part of individuals, based on their own abilities and characteristics, but united in the face of the challenging question as to the kind of world we want to leave to those who come after us, to children who are now growing up.
The Paris Conference represents an important phase in the process of re-establishing a balance between global greenhouse-gas emissions and the Earth’s capacity to absorb them. To that end, we urgently need to adopt a fair, transformational and legally binding global agreement. That would send a meaningful
signal to the entire international community, by promoting a rapid transition to development marked by a low carbon footprint and by providing a powerful impetus to reinforcing the intrinsic link between two objectives — eradicating poverty and easing the effects of climate change. That link shows that the threat of climate change and our responses to it can be a promising opportunity for improving health, transportation, energy security and new opportunities for employment. An effective accord on those issues, in addition to the important value they possess in and of themselves, can only contribute to general agreements between States regarding integral human development, the responsibility to protect, peace, disarmament and respect for international law.
To acknowledge the limitations of the Charter of the United Nations with regard to new crisis situations or, sadly, in the face of evidence of a failure to observe its prescriptions, is not the same thing as stating or lamenting the failure of the Organization itself. Such limitations are rather the inevitable shadows of the great framework of the first global project for peace and international cooperation, which has, happily, endured for 70 years and is an incentive to achieving full respect for the law in force and to promoting greater trust and cooperation. The Holy See thus expresses the hope that this seventieth anniversary, marked by the solemn adoption of the 2030 Agenda, may be the beginning of a harmonious and ever fuller cooperation for the benefit of all humankind.
Pope Benedict XVI, in 2008, and Pope Paul VI, during his visit 50 years ago for the Organization’s twentieth anniversary, both pointed out that the United Nations is called increasingly to serve as a sign of unity among States and an instrument of service to the entire human family, and that, consequently, the Organization represents the obligatory path of modern civilization and world peace. The United Nations must, therefore, become a place where a true family of nations and peoples can meet and prosper, a place where all forms of war and unilateral intervention will be forever prohibited, not only in words, but above all in the spirit and intentions of every governmental authority.
"
70,2015,GTM,"I come before this highest forum of the United Nations as the representative of the Government of Guatemala and of the President of the Republic, Alejandro Maldonado Aguirre. I greet Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. With his vast experience and well- known skill he can lead ably.
I want to begin my statement by expressing the grief and sorrow of the people and the Government of Guatemala after the tragedy that occurred last Thursday night, 1 October, when a landslide buried at least 125 homes, and in two hours killed 33 people and caused the disappearance of approximately 600 other citizens, as well as a considerable number of injured, in a town near Guatemala City. The landslide occurred as the result of the heavy rains that have plagued Guatemala after nearly 12 weeks of extreme drought, which caused serious damage to the country’s agricultural sector. Our rescue teams are now searching for survivors. More than 616 rescuers are participating, and the citizenry
15-29946 21/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
is providing invaluable and exemplary support. We are grateful for the international solidarity that the world has shown following that tragedy.
During the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, the Vice-President of Guatemala described the momentous events that have taken place in our country over the past several months, which represent a watershed in our political history (see A/70/ PV.6). He described how, beginning in April, the people of Guatemala took to the streets in huge numbers to demonstrate their complete rejection of corruption and their indignation at the collapse of an economic, social and political system that was incapable of overcoming poverty and segregation of all kinds that revealed grave flaws in our system of governance.
It is important to stress the pluralistic, mass nature of the civic movement and especially its peaceful character. There was not a single incident of violence during four months of protest. In fact, the protests lasted 22 weeks, during which the collective civic behaviour was exemplary, without incidents of any sort, without vandalism and without a single act of aggression of any kind.
That great popular movement led to the resignation and trial of the Vice-President and, subsequently, the President of the Republic, along with other Government officials and individuals. In that regard, it is important to stress the role that the United Nations played through the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala — known as CICIG —in support of the Public Prosecutor’s Office. As a result of the foregoing, and with our Political Constitution as its framework, a process was developed that culminated in the appointment of President Alejandro Maldonado Aguirre on 3 September and the election of Vice-President Juan Alfonso Fuentes Soria on 16 September. They now have the responsibility of leading the country towards the transfer of presidential power on 14 January 2016.
I would like to underscore that despite the serious challenges that arose, our laws and legally constituted institutions responded. The constitutional order remained intact and no laws were violated. The constitutional mechanisms, the system of justice, the electoral system and the social media all functioned, and in general terms, our participatory democracy proved its strength.
All of these factors affected the results of the general elections held on 6 September and had an
impact on voter turnout, which was the highest it has been since the return to democracy 30 years ago. Those important gains belong to all Guatemalans, who are demanding deep and immediate changes. Their expectations are high, and they hope to see concrete results benefiting citizens in a short time, both from the current transitional Government and from the one that will be elected in the second round of voting, which we will hold on 25 October.
The various sectors of Guatemalan society are demanding the urgent reform of certain laws, including those governing the civil service, the electoral process and political parties, legal education and State contracts. But perhaps the most important aspect is the social impact of the collective realization that Guatemala needs to aim for a future built on a genuine, solid rule of law. As we stated when we took the floor during the Summit to adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1):
“The invisible Guatemala, made up of indigenous peoples and peasants who have been marginalized by the system, has not been satisfied with the resigned approach taken by their leaders; it has flooded the streets to warn that the amendment of a few laws is not enough. They demand reforms of the State for a profound transformation of the economic, social and political system that would allow them to overcome poverty, exclusion and racism, thereby developing a true concept of national and international solidarity, an essential element of peace and security.” (A/70/PV.6, p. 4)
It is therefore important for the Guatemalan State to respond appropriately to the population’s demands to be able to consolidate our democracy on the foundation created by that extraordinary movement and to achieve a more peaceful, less exclusionary and more equitable society.
Another of the main challenges facing the State of Guatemala is to create better living conditions for its citizens in order to avoid the exodus of so many who must seek better horizons abroad. Migration should be an option, not an obligation. Approximately 2 million Guatemalans currently live outside the country, most of them in the United States of America. That is a long-standing phenomenon, but now one of the biggest concerns is the growing migration of boys and girls who travel by themselves, primarily with the goal of family reunification. Our countries should do their
22/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
best to see that such children remain at home instead of risking their lives.
Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador make up Central America’s Northern Triangle. With the support of the Inter-American Development Bank and the Government of the United States of America, we have been developing the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity, whose goal is to deal with the deepest roots of migration and to serve as a framework that offers new and better economic prospects; build the conditions for better civil security; create a social safety network for the most vulnerable groups of our societies; and strengthen our democratic institutions. In our draft budgets for 2016, the three countries have planned for approximately $2.8 million to implement the Plan.
There is shared responsibility among the countries of origin, transit and destination. Comprehensive immigration reform in the United States of America is inevitable. It is a matter of principles and respect for human rights. We appreciate the efforts of President Barack Obama, and I take this opportunity to reiterate my Government’s call for the approval of Temporary Protected Status, known as TPS, for Guatemalan immigrants. The State of Guatemala, for its part, needs to broaden its consular network as soon as possible, especially in the countries of North America, in order to offer protection and consular services to its citizens.
One of the main causes of migration is natural disasters. This year again, the long drought and the delay in rains in the first harvest have impacted food security in the most vulnerable homes. More than 120,000 families are currently affected, representing more than 600,000 people who lack food for subsistence. We are grateful for the cooperation that we have received and call for more, basically because on top of chronic poverty come natural disasters, and now the effects of the man-made crisis, which the citizens have rejected. Nevertheless, our great strength is without a doubt the desire for civic participation, which the transitional Government must support and respond to effectively with an extreme shortage of resources.
At the same time, I would like to reiterate the State’s commitment to the communities affected by the development of the Chixoy Hydroelectric Dam. We are committed to making reparations to the affected groups and expect to begin making the first payments in the coming weeks as part of a process that we hope to bring to a successful conclusion.
I would like now to mention a few subjects relating to our foreign policy. First, I am pleased to report that we have continued to make progress in our bilateral relations with our neighbouring countries.
With respect to Belize, we have committed to appearing before the International Court of Justice to seek definitive resolution of our territorial, island and marine dispute, as both countries have agreed. We look forward to the entry into force of the 13 bilateral agreements signed in December 2014 and the protocol to the special agreement of 2008, signed in May.
With Mexico we maintain a robust, significant agenda and an unprecedented dynamic of cooperation. Recently 12 agreements were signed on economic issues, trade, border modernization and energy, in addition to addressing jointly challenges such as migration and organized crime.
With Honduras, we have made progress on a customs union, a commitment that has been pending for many years in the Central American integration process. It will be the first customs union of the American hemisphere.
Moreover, Guatemala welcomes the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba as an important step towards the strengthening of hemispheric cooperation. In that connection, we trust that the embargo imposed on Cuba for over 50 years will end.
We also applaud the reconciliation and the growing climate of cooperation generated among the parties separated by the Taiwan Strait. We hope that that atmosphere of cooperation can be extended to the global effort to fight climate change.
Turning now to our position on some of the challenges facing the United Nations as this session begins, I want to reiterate our deep concern over the instability in the Middle East, above all the protracted conflict in Syria. It has had a huge cost in human life and suffering, as demonstrated by the terrible images of the current migration exodus.
At the same time I would like to highlight the central role played by peacekeeping operations and to reiterate our full support for their basic principles, which remain relevant and should be preserved. Guatemala’s contribution to such missions is a testament to our strong commitment to international peace and security.
15-29946 23/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
We believe that an important step has been taken in the review and assessment of those operations through the work of the High-level Independent Panel on all aspects of United Nations peace operations, as well as the Secretary-General’s report on the implementation of the Panel’s recommendations (A/70/357), and we stand ready to start a serious discussion of all measures that could improve our contribution to peacekeeping and the success of such operations.
We agree with other delegations that the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) was an important step to carry into the future the unfinished tasks of the Millennium Development Goals. We join in the clamour for a response in the Paris Climate Summit to the enormous challenges posed by climate change and hope that it will produce a legally binding instrument. I wish to share with the Assembly the fact that Guatemala has already played its part. It has already approved some important laws and national documents to present at the Summit.
We have followed the debate on reforming the principal organs and reviewing their working methods. We recognize that the international community is faced with limited resources and a plethora of needs and vulnerable populations to deal with. While recognizing the invaluable role played by the United Nations for humankind, we warn that the Organization has been lagging in adapting to the conditions of the twenty-first century. Let us unite efforts to advance this ambitious agenda for future generations.
Faced with the loss of so many lives in conflicts around the world, as well as new threats, it is timely for Member States to ask ourselves whether we are fulfilling the promise on which the Organization was founded — “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. But we reiterate our faith in the United Nations as we commemorate its 70 years, and we trust that it is in the hands of all the Member States to secure its growing relevance for the future so as to focus on peace, security and human rights.
"
70,2015,MCO,"The successful outcome of the United Nations Summit to adopt the post-2015 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) coincided with the seventieth anniversary of the Organization and reflected the joint resolve to face up to, over the 15 years, the many obstacles and global challenges that impede sustainable development for all. The Heads of State and
Government adopted a historic agreement whose goals aim at eradicating poverty and restoring dignity to each individual so that all might enjoy their freedoms and rights.
The twenty-first century should meet the expectations of peoples for higher social justice and for shared prosperity and a healthy environment that is respectful of future generations, as was quite rightly underlined by His Holiness Pope Francis in front of the General Assembly (see A/70/PV.3). The proliferation of conflicts and crises and the millions of victims caught up in their destructive wake further strengthen our determination to pursue the transformation of current models, whose ambition is to match the challenges we are facing.
The continuing tragedy in Syria and the barbaric means used by extremist groups, which is being propagated in West Africa and the Middle East, fill us with horror. Such groups indiscriminately target religious minorities, civilians, women and children — the latter always being the most common victims. In addition, the international community cannot remain indifferent in the face of the destruction of our common human heritage, such as the temples in Palmyra. They are a symbol of the Middle East as the cradle of a culture for thousands of years. We therefore strongly support the Secretary-General’s “Rights Up Front” initiative and his endeavour to establish a plan of action on preventing violent extremism.
In that regard, I should like to remind members that Monaco co-sponsored Security Council resolution 2178 (2014), on foreign terrorist fighters and combating violent extremism. The Principality of Monaco is already implementing Security Council resolutions on freezing assets and imposing economic sanctions on people who might be connected to terrorist networks. Furthermore, Monaco is currently reinforcing its legal framework in the area of national security. We are also actively participating in the fight against money laundering for funds coming from illicit activities.
We are aware of the importance of cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. Monaco therefore continues to support a peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine. We did so over the course of the last three months of 2014, when we chaired the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Forum for Security Co-operation,
15-29701 15/28

A/70/PV.21 30/09/2015
and we continue to do so today by supporting the work of the OSCE Observer Mission.
The past few months have seen flows of migrants in Europe that have been unprecedented since the Second World War. The dire humanitarian consequences require a coordinated multilateral approach. The European Union plan in that regard provides a timely response. The principle of the responsibility to protect was endorsed by His Serene Highness Prince Albert 10 years ago from this high rostrum; it must be the basis for our collective action in the face of genocide, ethnic cleansing and other crimes against humanity.
The primary responsibility bestowed by the charter of the Security Council to maintain international peace and security brings me to commend the courageous initiative taken by France and Mexico in calling for the voluntary and collective suspension of the right of veto by its five permanent members when dealing with mass atrocities. I take this opportunity today to announce Monaco’s official support for that initiative, as well as the one presented by the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group to develop a code of conduct that would apply to all Member States.
Let me also express our gratitude to those who promote such specific and ethical measures to reinforce the effectiveness of the Security Council and make its decisions more convincing in the face of public opinion. All of the efforts made to promote better representation in the Security Council merit support. My Government welcomes the recent developments in the intergovernmental negotiation process.
In one month’s time we will celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, when the results of the global study on its implementation will be released. Unfortunately, we are too sadly familiar with the devastating consequences of conflicts for women, who are often the first victims when they are, however, not responsible for such conflicts. Along with children, they also represent the majority of refugees and displaced persons. Convinced of the importance of the full and active participation of women on an equal footing in preventing conflicts and peacefully resolving them, as well as in peacebuilding and peacekeeping, we therefore call for the implementation of specific measures.
The issues to be tackled by the first humanitarian summit proposed by the Secretary-General are of the
utmost importance, and all the more given that, in addition to the human tragedy I have just mentioned, we must also address the issues of the victims of climate change, natural disasters and a health crisis. In that regard, the international community will have to define a new humanitarian deployment framework that can respond to the growing and complex needs, can support financing and can complement operations by providing planning and long-term development.
Regional consultations have already highlighted the concerns of various stakeholders. They will allow for adequate responses to be found not only that meet the complexity of the humanitarian crises but also the specificity of each of the crises. Monaco has participated actively in that preparatory work, in line with our commitment in the context of our international cooperation policy and as part of the major mobilization by our non-governmental organizations and the Monegasque Red Cross.
The magnitude of the Ebola virus epidemic served once again to demonstrate the absolute need to build effective sustainable health systems that can face up to extraordinary situations. In that regard, Monaco has already expressed its support for the reform that has been begun by the World Health Organization.
The Addis Ababa Action Agenda was developed to facilitate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its 17 Goals and 169 targets. The aim is to find an effective way to transform our lifestyles. The technology facilitation mechanism launched during that summit reflects a spirit of collaboration among all development stakeholders for the benefit of developing countries. It also bears witness to the will of the international community to build capacity in a specific manner.
However, those efforts will not be successful without an ambitious and legally binding universal agreement that allows us to fight climate change effectively and to move towards low-carbon and resilient societies and economies. The Principality of Monaco is convinced that the twenty-first Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris, will be part of that trend and will help us to achieve a global climate agreement. Such an agreement is a sine qua non condition for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

That is why Prince Albert has committed the Principality to reducing its greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2030, as compared with 1990 levels. He has also renewed his commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050. In setting those objectives, the Principality demonstrates its willingness to take a full part in the collective effort needed to face one of humankind’s biggest challenges. Despite its low emissions footprint, Monaco will continue to promote innovative means of transportation and consumption, as well as urban planning that is as green as possible.
We cannot talk about the climate without talking about the issue of the oceans, which play a central role in regulating the world’s climate. That is the reason that has led the Principality of Monaco to support the 2015 ocean and climate platform of UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. Monaco is pleased to see that this is an integral part of the sustainable development programme, which strengthens the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea — a veritable constitution of the oceans. That is the sense behind the personal commitment of Prince Albert and also of his leadership of his Government’s actions in favour of healthy and productive oceans and seas. To ensure the implementation of this agenda, Monaco proposes to convene conferences every three years from 2017 onwards.
For small island developing States the ocean is not just a source of economic and social benefit, it is also an integral part of their identity. For that reason, Monaco has increased its cooperation for climate change adaptation and for the preservation of biodiversity as well as for access to water, the development of sustainable tourism and for capacity-building.
In conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Assembly that for several years now Monaco has proposed increasing the protection of marine mammals from the growing threat caused by human beings. We hope that this proposal will be included in the omnibus draft resolution on oceans at this current session.
In 70 years, the United Nations has worked to honour the goals bestowed on it by the Charter. It has repeatedly adapted itself to emerging challenges that have transformed the world since its creation. The political will that prevailed during the United Nations Summit to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals
has served to encourage us to further strengthen the Organization by giving it the means to pursue its noble mandate. We have thus reaffirmed the legitimacy of the values and principles of the Charter of the United Nations in today’s world. The Principality of Monaco remains more than ever convinced that this is necessary, and it will continue to make its modest but resolute contribution to building a better world while respecting our differences.
"
70,2015,SYC," “We the peoples of the United Nations, determined ...”. Yes, these are bold and visionary words drafted 70 years ago, providing the United Nations with its sense of purpose and the world with a vision that continues to inspire and motivate us.
I have always believed in this vision. We all do, in fact. Yet, in spite of all the good intentions and the inspiration we continue to draw from the Charter, something seems to be sorely lacking. That something is determination. President Lykketoft’s urging for a new commitment to action more than confirms this. His experience affords him the privilege of speaking his mind, and so does mine.
We must look around us. Let us look at the world. It is a world lacking in determination, a world torn apart by vicious wars and conflicts. It is a world where poverty, hunger, famine and epidemics continue to grow unabated, where inequality, injustice and disparity are on the rise; a world where environmental degradation and despoliation go unchecked; a world — our world — menaced by climate change.
Is that the legacy we want to leave to our children? No, my friends, it cannot be so. We must hear the cries of children who are hungry or in distress. We must hear the cries of despair of islanders affected by climate change. We must feel the pain of women struggling to keep their children alive. We must stop spending money to destroy lives. Instead, we must act together, not only to keep alive those struggling to survive, but to give meaning to their lives. We therefore have a duty and an obligation to change the world we live in and to make it a better place for current and future generations.
We can make that happen if we set our minds to it; if we, who are in the privileged position of leading our peoples, accept our responsibilities; if we cast aside indecisiveness; if we look beyond the narrow pursuit of ideological and national interests. We can make it happen if we adopt the principles of justice and fairness, not half-heartedly but resolutely.
Let us start with the United Nations itself. Its lofty ideals are as relevant today as when it was founded. However, its structures of governance, particularly the Security Council, are not. In today’s world, it represents a fundamentally undemocratic and unrepresentative institution. The same applies to the international organizations set up in the wake of the creation of the United Nations. We have to make them relevant to the realities of the present era. We need action, determination and commitment to set things right, to make all of them relevant to the century we live in and to give true meaning to an all-inclusive and participatory democracy.
15-29437 21/26

A/70/PV.17 29/09/2015
We also need resolute action if the spirit and essence of sustainable development is to be truly embraced globally. Many challenges still remain, especially for small island developing States (SIDS). We are the sentinels of nature and the guardians of the oceans. But the actions — or inaction, as the case may be — of others threaten our livelihood and our very existence. As Pope Francis has just emphasized, we must break the current growth model and give primacy to the protection of nature over consumerism, thereby minimizing the effects of climate change. Climate change is not of small island States’ making, yet we bear the full brunt of it. That is why we shall never cease to raise the issue in every forum, including this one, because we are the conscience of the world.
The President’s acceptance speech (see A/69/PV.94) set the tone for a new commitment to action and, I believe, to determination. The two are indivisible. They form an appropriate backdrop to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). The 2030 Agenda sets realistic Goals, targets and a time frame for the creation of a better world, leaving no one behind. It is an all-inclusive Agenda, which makes it abundantly clear that there can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development.
Sustainability has always been and will continue to be at the heart of the development efforts of the Seychelles. Together with our fellow small island developing States, we have been actively engaged in this discourse to ensure that our concerns and needs are adequately addressed. The engagement of the United Nations under the Secretary-General’s bold leadership has given us a ray of hope. We have again seen many commitments and pledges. But will those alone resolve our challenges? No, not unless they are translated into concrete actions.
The application — or rather, the non-application — of the principle of special and differential treatment for small island developing States is one of our major preoccupations. It is not because some of us have achieved upper-middle-income or high-income status that our development efforts are thwarted by the non-provision of international funds at concessionary rates. A one-size-fits-all approach to development cannot be the order of the day. It is unjust and morally inacceptable. We, the inhabitants of small island developing States, will never cease to remind everyone
of this. That is because islands remain the moral compass of the world, and because our own agenda is inextricably linked to that of humankind. We will always insist on the need for a more tailored approach in tackling the specific challenges we face, one that takes our vulnerabilities into account. The lack of an appropriate vulnerability index that can be applied effectively to development hampers the effective empowerment of small island developing States.
Goal 14 of the 2030 Agenda is of particular importance to all SIDS and coastal States. It presents us with a unique opportunity to set a standard for global governance of the oceans and seas. The Goal to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development provides the thrust for the blue economy. That concept has been adopted by many small island developing States as a mechanism for realizing sustainable growth, based on an ocean economy and an ocean governance. The Barbados Programme of Action, the Mauritius Strategy and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway are key to this. For oceanic nations, the sea is our lifeblood and the blue economy is the catalyst through which we can learn to thrive.
But we cannot thrive in an environment of insecurity. Maritime security is of the utmost importance to the vast majority of SIDS and to coastal States. In our part of the world, though piracy is on the wane, we must remain vigilant. As we have demonstrated in the case of piracy, however, global alliances have made a difference in providing security where there was none. In that regard, I would like to express my gratitude to the United Nations and other international partners for all their support in our fight against piracy in the Indian Ocean. My hope is that this model will be replicated in order to tackle similar issues that threaten our collective resolve to build lasting peace. The likes of terrorist organizations pose threats that have lasting repercussions, reverberating across borders. The growing refugee crisis reminds us that we should all shoulder the burden of fighting the ideologies of hate and embrace the bonds of fraternity and solidarity.
Looking forward to the Climate Change Conference in Paris, let us use the little time that is left to build further momentum and support in order to reach an ambitious and universal agreement to combat climate change. Paris is not just another international negotiation. It will be the crucial and decisive moment
22/26 15-29437

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17
of choice for all of us. We cannot allow ourselves to be condemned to the wrong side of history by our collective failure to reach an agreement. The stakes are too high. An agreement is within our reach, provided we are able to summon the collective political will and leadership. The time is now. We can make it happen. We must make it happen. We must fulfil the promises and commitments made, especially in terms of financing options to build climate resilience. In that regard, we call on all developed countries to honour their commitments for the mobilization of $100 billion annually by 2020 for the operationalization of the Green Climate Fund.
Seychelles is one of the smallest Members of the United Nations family and will continue to play an active role in the Organization’s efforts to create a just and safer world. The observance of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations is a unique opportunity to transform the world by our own efforts and commitments and to ensure that collective cooperation and partnership triumph over rivalry and mistrust. In that spirit, we salute the rapprochement between the United States of America and Cuba.
We have a unique opportunity to choose the future we want for ourselves and for our youth and our children. We must give them a better deal because they deserve a better deal. Let us truly become what we are destined to be — committed, determined, united and empowered nations forging our future together. Yes, together.
"
70,2015,ERI,"It is my pleasure, at the outset, to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I also wish to extend my deep appreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his commendable efforts in conducting the business of the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly.
Seventy years after the birth of the United Nations, with its promise of peace, justice and development for all and its call for all nations to act in concert for the common good, it is undeniable, however, that we continue to live in an unfair and unequal world — a world where conflicts and wars rage, where extreme
poverty persists in the midst of plenty, where children die from easily preventable diseases and where justice is routinely trampled.
The United Nations is itself a reflection of the unfair, unequal and undemocratic global order. In the United Nations, the overwhelming majority of Member States are marginalized. The General Assembly, which should be the most powerful organ, is bereft of real power and influence. Power and decision-making are dominated by a few among the few. Two decades of talk to reform the Organization have yielded zero results. The resistance of those who believe that they benefit from the current configuration is so stiff and the ranks of those who seek change are so divided by approaches driven by narrow national interests that the enthusiasm for reform is giving way to a disquieting paralysis.
Yet all Member States, peoples and political and social forces that thirst for peace, justice, equitable socioeconomic development and the protection and enhancement of the environment must not give up. We need to persist in our efforts to rebuild and revitalize the United Nations. We need to strengthen our solidarity and defend the time-tested principles of the equal sovereignty of nations, respect for territorial integrity, peaceful coexistence, the right of nations to choose their social and economic path of development, respect for the dignity and rights of citizens and migrants, and fidelity to the Charter of the United Nations and international law. We need to work and cooperate at the national, regional and global levels to achieve sustainable and equitable development, a lofty goal that underpins peace and social justice.
We need to fight to avert an environmental catastrophe that awaits humankind and threatens human civilization. That will require more than human ingenuity and advances in science and technology. We must realize that there can be no technological fix to the environmental challenge. It will require radical change away from economic and social systems based on greed, the maximization of profits for the few, massive inequality, and unsustainable and unhealthy patterns of consumption and gross wastage.
Eritrea is committed to striving for a fair, just, truly representative and effective United Nations, because it was and still is a victim of the United Nations and the Powers that have dominated the Organization. Six decades ago, we were denied our inalienable right to self-determination and independence. For three
15-29946 7/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
decades, we were savagely bombed from the air and the ground, with the aim of crushing our liberation struggle; and today we are being subjected to unfair and illegitimate sanctions and baseless accusations. The United Nations and its Security Council continue to countenance the illegal occupation of our sovereign territory in violation of international law and several Security Council resolutions.
Despite that hostility and injustice, Eritrea achieved independence by dint of a heroic struggle against tremendous odds. Today, Eritrea is making remarkable progress in building a nation based on citizenship and inclusiveness and respect for human dignity and rights. It is peaceful, stable, secure and harmonious, achieving unity in diversity, with its people animated by a common struggle and committed to a common future. It has avoided the pitfalls of sectarianism, radicalization and terrorism that have infected the surrounding region and many other areas in the world.
On another front, Eritrea is building a solid basis for sustainable development with social justice by prioritizing education, health, agriculture, industrialization, infrastructure, science and technology, all within a framework of regional cooperation and integration in the Horn of Africa and the Gulf region across the Red Sea. Eritrea welcomes the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which are in accord with its development vision and priorities, and is determined to achieve them ahead of the 2030 deadline.
Maintaining its focus on development, Eritrea is fighting human trafficking and is working to stabilize illegal migration and give youth and women adequate opportunities to pursue a high quality of life and build their nation. Eritrea is also making its contribution to regional peace, stability and security in the Red Sea region and the Horn of Africa. Eritrea sees its own efforts to promote peace, justice, development and environmental protection as part of the global struggle for a better, fairer and more equitable world and for a strong, effective and truly representative United Nations.
"
70,2015,CZE,"If a speaker has many topics in a short speech, he has none. If he has many priorities in his speech, he also has none. So let me concentrate on a one topic and one priority — the fight against international terrorism.
One may ask: why does the President of a small Central European country speak about terrorism? There are two reasons. First, terrorism is outrage against human civilization and, at the same time, it is the main danger for human civilization. The second reason is that today, as the Assembly is aware, nearly all European countries face a big migration wave that was provoked by and is a consequence of terrorist actions in the Middle East and in Africa.
It is wonderful to criticize terrorism. It is wonderful to organize demonstrations and manifestations against terrorism, and it is nice to prepare declarations protesting terrorism. I am sure that Mr. Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, reading such declarations, will be careful. In any case, there are three illusions concerning terrorism.
The first illusion is that terrorism will vanish, that it is something like a historical fluctuation, and that we can eliminate or reduce terrorist actions without human endeavour or by using only local means. On the contrary, the terrorist movement is growing like a cancer. There is a diffusion of terrorism, a growing number of so-called failed States, of assassinations, cruelties, murders, annihilation of cultural artefacts, such as the Palmyra ruins, and so on. We cannot deny this growing process.
The second illusion is that we can reduce terrorist organizations to the so-called Islamic State only. But there are many other terrorist organizations — for instance, Al-Qaida, the Taliban, Al-Nusra, Boko Haram and others. Two outstanding politicians from the Arab world told me that the cover organization is the Muslim Brotherhood. If so, there is a terrorism network, and that network cannot be reduced simply to the Islamic State.
The third illusion is based on a standard form of warfare against terrorism. We know that nearly all generals prepare for the previous war. What I propose
15-29437 23/26

A/70/PV.17 29/09/2015
for the fight against terrorism are no tanks, no infantry, no artillery. We need to seek new forms for the fight. Because unilateral actions are heavily criticized and, what is more, have been completely unsuccessful, as in the case of Iraq, I do not recommend any massive occupation of any territory. What I recommend is a coordinated action, under the umbrella of the Security Council. The five permanent members of the Council have different interests but one common enemy, and nothing unites more than one common enemy — terrorism. Here in New York, we remember 11 September 2001; in Russia, we remember Beslan and Volgograd; in China we remember Xinjiang; in Europe we remember Madrid, London, Paris and Copenhagen; in India we remember Bombay, and so on.
There is one good precedent, and it is the unanimously adopted Security Council resolution 2184 (2014), concerning pirates in Somalia, including military action against pirates. Does anyone really think that the pirates are more dangerous than the terrorists? In the Charter of the United Nations, there are many, many Articles concerning the possibility of military action, and some of them are never activated. They are referred to as the sleeping structures. What we need is to activate them. We need small military units equipped with drones, helicopters, cooperation of secret services, commandos or rangers — some kind of contingent of Blue Helmets — which would eliminate the leaders of terrorist organizations and their nerve centres, and not the occupation of territory.
I firmly hope that some of the permanent members might propose such a resolution. If not, as a historical optimist, I might add a conclusion that any idea goes through three phases. In the first phase, it is understood as complete nonsense. In the second phase, it is disputable, and in the third phase, it is as evident as the Earth’s movement around the sun. I will return next year, and deep in my heart, I do believe that my proposal will be disputable. When I come in 2017, I am sure that this proposal will be evident.
"
70,2015,ISL,"The world has changed enormously since the establishment of the United Nations 70 years ago. It has become a real world body with 193 Member States. The United Nations has established a peacekeeping structure, overseen the development of a strong human rights framework and set up key agencies for development, humanitarian issues and the environment. And we have seen the codification of international law under the auspices of the United Nations through such landmark treaties as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Over the same period, the United Nations has witnessed the agonies and tragedies of several generations around the world —tragedies brought on by poverty, conflict and natural disasters.
The United Nations has not always met our expectations, but it is the only organization through which all countries can work to solve the problems that we face today and to prevent potential problems in the future. This anniversary year provides a striking example of how the world’s nations, within the forum of the United Nations, can work together to chart a future for our peoples. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda are achievements of which we should be proud. Iceland, together with many other Member
States, worked hard to achieve the balanced result we see today. We are particularly pleased with the prominence of gender equality and the empowerment of women, which are key to sustainable development.
We are also pleased that the sustainable management of natural resources is central to both those Agendas. Eliminating hunger will require food security. That can be achieved only by safeguarding and sustainably managing the only two sources of food we have: the ocean and the land. Inefficient fisheries management and the lack of infrastructure in that field cost our societies around $50 billion every year. Also, arable land the size of South Africa becomes degraded every year. We now have a blueprint for fixing that, and Iceland is committed to contributing to those efforts.
Another highly significant aim in terms of the sustainable management of natural resources is Goal 7, on affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. We need to aim for the elimination of carbon-based fuels and, in the meantime, to channel the enormous amount of subsidies granted in the fossil-fuel sector — some $14.5 billion a day — towards renewable energy resources. That would be a good start, and here, those who count need to be counted.
Iceland also worked hard with others to include in the 2030 Agenda language that deals with non-communicable diseases, including neurological disorders.
The universal nature of our new, common Goals requires each of our States to contribute at the national, regional and global levels. None of us can succeed alone. Iceland is committed to playing its part in reaching those ambitious Goals.
Everywhere we are witnessing the drastic consequences of climate change. Last month, with participants from other Arctic countries, I took part in the Global Leadership Conference in Alaska, aimed at drawing attention to the impacts of climate change, which are particularly revealing in that region. Temperatures in the Arctic are increasing at more than twice the average global rate. The region’s fragile ecosystem is increasingly at risk, and Arctic communities are experiencing at first hand the challenges of dealing with a rapidly changing climate. The consequences are far reaching, as shrinking glaciers in the North contribute to higher sea levels in the South.
There is still time to turn things around. The meeting on the United Nations Framework Convention
24/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
on Climate Change in Paris in December will be a chance — maybe our last one — to put ourselves on track towards a sustainable future and to take decisions based on best available science. Iceland is committed to an ambitious, long-term global climate agreement and intends, working collectively with other countries in Europe, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent in 2030.
We have been asked to focus on the road ahead for peace, security and human rights. When injustice is the everyday experience of a large part of the population, and when people have no voice, peace and security are at risk. And without peace and security, we will not achieve sustainable development. At the same time, peace and security considerations cannot be used as a justification for violating human rights.
The imposition of the death penalty should not be justified by the pretext of needing to maintain order and security. In that regard, the case of Ali Mohammed al-Nimr in Saudi Arabia, a minor when his alleged crimes took place, is particularly worrying. I call on Saudi Arabia to uphold its international obligations and commute his sentence.
One characteristic of a just and humane society is the way it treats its minorities and the most vulnerable. Iceland will continue to work with others for non-discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Human rights are for all men, all women, all girls and all boys, not just for some. “We the people” includes everyone.
Iceland will continue to be a champion of gender equality and the empowerment of women, as are many other committed Member States. At the beginning of the year I co-hosted, with my colleague from Suriname, a successful Barbershop Conference here at the United Nations. The aim was to get others to join in getting men to be more active on the issue of gender equality. I saw it also as support for the He For She campaign run by UN-Women. In the light of that success, Iceland intends to host Barbershops in other international organizations of which we are members.
The small size of our world is being set into sharp relief by the ongoing migrant and refugee situation. Particularly in Europe, well before the Syrian crisis, we witnessed the desperate efforts of men and women fleeing their own countries, often with tragic
consequences, in search of a safe future for themselves and their children. The search for a better life is nothing new. About one fifth of Iceland’s population left our country in the late nineteenth century in the face of extreme poverty and harsh weather conditions. For many Icelanders and millions of European who undertook the perilous journey to North America, emigration was a matter of survival. Others were escaping injustice and political systems in which they had no voice.
The current refugee crisis, however, is unprecedented in recent times. The term migration hardly captures the severity of the situation. This is an exodus. We have all seen the figures. This year alone, some 500,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe, and millions have fled to neighbouring countries. Here, I would like to pay tribute to Syria’s neighbours, who have quietly and resolutely given shelter to the great majority of the refugees. The conflict in Syria, with its complex roots in the larger conflicts in the region, has produced a scale of suffering that we all hoped never to see again. The long-term solution has to be to solve the conflict in Syria, and others like it, by political means.
The Security Council bears the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. We call on all Security Council members, in the words of the Charter, to “unite their strength” to halt the bloodshed in Syria. The situation is already having consequences far beyond the region. Meanwhile, it is the humanitarian duty of the rest of the world to seek ways to reduce the suffering of the refugees. These are extreme circumstances and call for extraordinary measures.
The Icelandic Government has decided to allocate $16 million to deal with the crisis and to support the vital work of front-line United Nations institutions, like the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme and UNICEF, and to welcome increased numbers of refugees to Iceland. This is, however, not a numbers game. There are different circumstances in different countries. But we all have to do what we can. These are defining moments in history.
Iceland reiterates its strong conviction that the only path to peace between Israel and Palestine is the two-State solution. Both sides need to commit fully to that solution, and they must refrain from actions that undermine it. Of continuing and deep concern is the humanitarian situation of the Palestinians, particularly
15-29816 25/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
in Gaza, where we continue to call for the lifting of the blockade. Israel must abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law and human rights law. That includes an immediate halt to the demolition of Palestinian homes and an end to the displacement of Palestinians from their land. Terrorist activity on the part of Palestinian elements is also totally unacceptable and can only undermine peace. We condemn all acts of violence against civilians. The safety and well-being of civilians on both sides must always be ensured.
While the situation in the Middle East region gives little cause for optimism, there has recently been a triumph of diplomacy over conflict. I would like to congratulate all the parties that achieved the breakthrough agreement on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran’s nuclear programme. We hope to see that agreement contribute to greater stability in the region. We should be careful not to forget other disputes, which, if not attended to, could flare up. Here, I am thinking of the Western Sahara.
On this seventieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations, we should recall the basic tenets of the Charter of the United Nations and related instruments. They include refraining from “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State”. It is a matter of grave concern when a permanent member of the Security Council acts to undermine the territorial integrity of another State. The rule of law and the peaceful resolution of disputes are of existential importance for small States like mine.
The United Nations is not perfect. I would like, however, to compliment Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the determination with which he has approached the Organization’s shortcomings. There is important work under way to revitalize the General Assembly. Iceland welcomes resolution 69/321 on that topic, in particular with regard to the appointment of the Secretary-General. After a succession of eight men in the position of Secretary-General, it is high time for qualified female candidates to be seriously considered for that most important international position. The same applies to the position of the President of the General Assembly. The gender imbalance in high-level positions must be addressed if we wish to strengthen the credibility of the United Nations.
Iceland has long supported an expansion in the permanent and non-permanent seats in the Security Council. It is a difficult process, but we cannot ignore
the current increasingly indefensible situation, in which the Security Council represents the world as it was in 1945. The danger is that its authority will gradually be undermined if it does not better reflect the world as it is.
Iceland is ready to look at all options for squaring the circle. In the meantime, Iceland has stated its support for the initiative by France and Mexico on regulating the use of the veto and for the code of conduct on Security Council actions against genocide and other crimes against humanity, drafted by the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group of States.
"
70,2015,BHS,"I bring you, Sir, and the Assembly warm fraternal and sisterly greetings from the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the country which one of our most famous sons, the Reverend Dr. Myles Munroe, now sadly deceased, described as the place where God resides.
I would like to pause just for a few minutes to acknowledge the expressions of concern that have come from across the world about the fact that there is a hurricane sitting over the southern part of the Bahamas. There has been considerable flooding. We have not heard of any loss of life. There is likely to be some property damage. I suppose that by morning we will know the true impact of the hurricane. I would like to thank the Assembly for its expressions of concern.
We return this year, on the seventieth anniversary of the Organization, to reaffirm the values we committed to in 1973 when we subscribed to the Charter of the United Nations — from democracy, the rule of law, the protection of the weak and vulnerable to the elimination of all forms of discrimination. Each year at this time we join the struggle anew to fight to uphold those values. Tonight, I pause to reflect on the progress we have made in some areas.
This year, for example, marks the thirtieth year since the Nassau Accord was agreed and signed by the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth of Nations in our capital city, in October 1985. That Accord led to a comprehensive set of sanctions on the apartheid regime of South Africa and helped free Nelson Mandela and establish full democracy in the Republic of South Africa.
As we look back, despite the world’s troubles, we can repeat the words of the old African American preacher: “I know we ain’t what we want to be, but thank God we ain’t what we was.” I also repeat the concerns that I raised last year: the environment, climate change, crime and security, the economy and the development of our young people (see A/69/PV.20).
I want to turn to the Sustainable Development Goals. Our Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Perry Christie, was among the world leaders who last week unanimously adopted the ambitious, transformative and universal 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which will chart our way forward for the next 15 years and solidify and reaffirm our commitment to the pillars of the Organization and to environmental protection.
With respect to crime and security, I recall the words of a former Prime Minister of Jamaica, the late Michael Manley, who often spoke of a symbiotic relationship between the developed world and the Caribbean region. He said that each year, millions of people from the developed world travelled to our region to have a peaceful, quiet and salubrious vacation. That, he argued, was a benefit to them. The Caribbean region, including the Bahamas, provides a tourist experience that is unparalleled in the world. However, the world must pay attention to the underlying development issues that the region faces, lest that benefit be threatened. For example, we must stop the escalating crime and violence from drug trafficking, human trafficking and smuggling and juvenile gangs. That is why we have
18/26 15-29876

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24
been so strong in our support of the small arms trade treaty. The carnage of our young people, which is due in particular to the fact that guns are easily available to young males, is not acceptable and is unsustainable.
The Bahamas was pleased to have participated actively in the First Conference of States Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), held in Mexico in August. While we are disappointed that the ATT secretariat will not be located in our region, in our sister Caribbean Community (CARICOM) country of Trinidad and Tobago, we, nevertheless, are committed to the full and effective implementation of that Treaty. We call on the producers of these weapons to do more to stop their illegal export to our region and end the carnage. As Mr. Manley rightly pointed out many years ago, the developed world will not be immune if the matter is not brought under control.
With regard to development and reform, there can be no economic and social development unless we achieve gender equality and empower women and girls. The Bahamas is committed to this achievement and empowerment and has actively participated in various meetings on gender equality and the advancement of women, regionally and here at the United Nations. We were represented on 27 September at the Global Leaders Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment by our Minister for Gender Affairs, the Honourable Melanie Griffin. The Bahamas is proud to have now ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocols to the Convention of the Rights of the Child. These acts, in our view, enhance our commitment to human rights.
Scales of assessment for peacekeeping are being reviewed. The Bahamas attaches great importance to the United Nations peacekeeping operations as these, in part, underpin the purposes of the United Nations. It remains fully committed to meeting its financial obligations to the Organization in a full and timely manner and without any conditions. The Bahamas is, however, of the view that those scales of assessment should take into consideration the unique circumstances of small island developing States, particularly those that are most vulnerable. It also maintains that gross domestic product and gross national income per capita, should not serve as the main component in determining the levels of assessment for peacekeeping operations and, furthermore, that no developing country should be categorized above level C.
I would now like to address the issues of human rights, the human rights aspects of national development and the fact that we are presenting our candidature for election to the Human Rights Council. With the same critical sense of direction, commitment and urgency expressed earlier with regard to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and reform within the Organization, the Bahamas is actively crafting, with a critical eye, a 25-year citizen-driven national development plan — Vision 2040. The national development plan will provide a comprehensive overview of the economy, set policy direction for economic growth and identify strategies, programmes and projects to improve the overall health and sustainability of the Bahamian economy. It is being led by one of our young Ministers, Khaalis Rolle. It will also reinvigorate our national outlook and set new priorities for our international engagement going forward. We will enhance our expertise in the areas of maritime affairs and ocean conservation, environmental sustainability and economic and tax matters to assist in the further development and execution of our national priorities, both regionally and internationally. We are continuing to try to build a stronger Bahamas.
The Bahamas is seeking a seat on the Human Rights Council in the election to be held on 28 October. The Bahamas is the first State member of the Caribbean Community and the first English-speaking country in the Latin American and Caribbean region to do so. We do not do so lightly. Our election to the Human Rights Council would provide a unique opportunity to bring balance in the promotion and consideration of global human rights issues in that we would provide the perspective of a small State. We hope that we can count on the support of Member States for our candidature for election both to the Human Rights Council and to the Council of the International Maritime Organization.
I speak up again this year for the right of the people of the Turks and Caicos islands to self-determination. The Bahamas is among those justly demanding reparations for the damage inflicted on Caribbean societies by slavery. In the words of our poet and singer Tony McKay: “I come to collect everything that you owe me ... pay me what you owe me.” The Bahamas supports our sister CARICOM State, Belize, in its quest to live within secure and recognized borders. Similarly, we are deeply concerned about the attempt to undermine the territorial integrity of our sister CARICOM State, Guyana.

The Bahamas is pleased at the rapprochement between the United States of America and Cuba. President Barack Obama of the United States has made the right, courageous decision. This enhances the peace in our neighbourhood, and our officials are working with Cuba on synergies for the development of our economies. This year we will once again support an end to the economic embargo when the draft resolution is voted on in the General Assembly.
Concerning the environment and climate change, I would like to say that we welcome the launch on 30 September of the Small Island Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative (SIDS DOCK), which was jointly developed by the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre and the secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, in cooperation with the Alliance of Small Island States. SIDS DOCK is meant to assist small island developing States in the Pacific and Caribbean regions in addressing the effects of climate change, providing them with a collective institutional mechanism to help them transform their national energy sectors into catalysts for sustainable economic development and generating financial resources for addressing adaptation to climate change.
We affirm our commitment to a binding agreement in Paris at the forthcoming Climate Change Conference and urge all countries to work to that end. As I said earlier, even as we speak the Bahamas is under the threat of flooding and a hurricane. When one realizes that 80 per cent of our land is lower than five feet above sea level, one understands that a tidal surge is certainly an existential threat to our country and an example of a threat posed by climate change. We urge continued support for the people of Dominica, our sister CARICOM State, which suffered enormous damage and loss of life from Tropical Storm Erika in August. We would also like to express our solidarity with the people of Chile, who suffered damage and loss of life during the recent earthquake there.
Migration and the global refugee crisis are an increasing problem around the world. In the view of the Bahamas, we are facing the most pressing refugee crisis since the Second World War. In recent months, we have seen hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees from conflict- and war-torn areas throughout the Middle East embarking on perilous journeys in their search for refuge in Western Europe.
For the Bahamas, illegal migration through its territory is an awful reality. We are resolute in our task
of ensuring that migration is lawful, safe and orderly, and that it involves increased dialogue and greater participation in the process by all countries of origin, transit and destination. We are equally mindful of our international obligations, in tandem with our sovereign right to protect our borders. We strive to ensure that respect for human rights is integral to our migration policies. The Bahamas will, however, take all measures within the law and international norms to protect its borders and ensure that it is not overrun by illegal migrants.
I end with a plea for the young people of the world. We must commit to them afresh, here at the United Nations. They are the future, and everything we do must be done keeping in mind the fact that, whether we like it or not, we are handing things over to them. Now is the time to act to end their sense of hopelessness and their joblessness. The Prime Minister of the Bahamas said it here again last week: if we ignore them, we do so at our peril (see A/70/PV.4).
Back in 1919, the Irish poet William Butler Yeats, speaking to his generation, lamented that the centre could not hold. That poem was written before the United Nations came into being. Today, this body is at the centre of the human endeavour, so let us ensure that the centre does hold. The Bahamas is committed to the United Nations and to a sustainable future for our world. Where better than in this building, and who better than the United Nations? I say again, now more than ever we need the United Nations.
"
70,2015,ARE,"It is my pleasure to congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session, and to affirm that the United Arab Emirates stands ready to provide the fullest support during his presidency.
This year’s session is of particular significance as it marks the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations and the commencement of a new chapter that builds on the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through the adoption by our Heads of State and Government of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). My country welcomes this ambitious agenda and believes that it will transform the world over the next 15 years.
The United Arab Emirates is deeply worried by the upsurge of violence due to active extremist actions in my region that undermines its stability. Terrorist crimes have surged in an ugly manner unseen since the end of the Second World War, committed by the Islamic State
of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Hezbullah, Al-Qaida and other groups that exploit religion for political purposes. We condemn the brutal methods used by these groups in the name of Islam. They have no connection with the tolerant teachings of Islam, which calls for coexistence and tolerance.
Our principled position, as we stand shoulder to shoulder with the people and Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt, is based on our firm belief that the stability and prosperity of Egypt reinforces the stability of our region. The recent political and economic achievements of the Government of Egypt are major steps towards its recovery and positively assist the recovery and stability of the region and restore Egypt’s pivotal and historic role in the region. We commend Al-Azhar University for its long-standing tradition in confronting extremist ideologies, and the role of its scholars in renewing the religious discourse. We call on the international community to provide Egypt with the fullest support in its fight against extremism and terrorism.
My country’s is participating in the coalition supporting the legitimate Government of Yemen in response to the request by the President of Yemen to provide the necessary support to the Government and people of Yemen in confronting the Houthi coup, and combating other terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIL that have exploited the chaotic and unstable conditions in Yemen and increased their terrorist acts. We seek, with the international community, to restore the political process in Yemen in accordance with the agreed
parameters, most importantly the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative and its Implementation Mechanism. To this end, it is important to ensure full compliance with Security Council resolution 2216 (2015), which was adopted after consultations with relevant States of the region.
This process underscores the importance of improving the working methods of the Security Council by involving affected States and regional organizations in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, which will enhance the effectiveness of the Organization and contribute significantly to improving the implementation of United Nations resolutions and the prevention of conflicts. We commend the Special Envoy of the Secretary- General for Yemen. We affirm our continued support for the Arab coalition led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its commitment to enhancing the capacity of the Yemeni people to restore stability. We regard the liberation of Aden from the Houthi rebels to be a military and humanitarian victory, with Aden now the logistical base for delivering vital humanitarian aid to the Yemeni people.
To alleviate the humanitarian situation in Yemen, we have provided assistance worth more than $200 million. We will continue to work with the United Nations to deliver aid to meet the humanitarian emergency needs of the neediest people. We believe that the full control of Bab Al-Mandab by the coalition forces is yet another military success in securing that vital sea lane. It marks the end of the control of the rebels and their ISIL supporters, while demonstrating their weakening presence in other strategic areas in Yemen.
We are deeply concerned regarding the ongoing tension and instability in Libya, which represent a major threat to security and stability in the region. We stress the need to lift the ban imposed on the capacities of the elected Libyan Government to fight ISIL and other terrorist organizations and to respond to transboundary threats.
We are increasingly concerned about the inability of the international community to reach a political settlement of the Syrian crisis and put an end to the violence and systematic mass atrocities committed by the Syrian regime against its own people, which have resulted in the displacement of millions of Syrians and the destruction of their properties. The crisis has also had serious humanitarian consequences on affected
neighbouring countries and created a political and security vacuum exploited by terrorist organizations, especially ISIL and the Al-Nusra Front. The Security Council must therefore fulfil its principal mandate and reach a consensus on a settlement of the Syrian crisis so asto ensure a political transition and the formation of a new Government incorporating all components of Syrian society. We also stress the importance of the ongoing delivery of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people by the international community.
We affirm our humanitarian commitment to supporting the Syrian people and alleviating their suffering. Since the beginning of the conflict, we have received more than 100,000 Syrian nationals and extended humanitarian and development assistance totalling more than $530 million. The Syrian and Libyan crises have demonstrated the heavy human and political toll that we are seeing every day, especially through the suffering of women and children in their mass exodus as they search for safe havens and safe livelihoods, and the heavy price paid by refugees who have lost their lives in tragic conditions. The barbaric acts of destruction committed by terrorist organizations against historical symbols and sites have also revealed the considerable loss caused to our human and cultural heritage.
As it has done in Syria, ISIL has exploited the unstable conditions and sectarian practices to further hostilities and violence among the Iraqi factions and destroy Iraq’s historical and cultural heritage. Therefore, we continue to stand in solidarity with Iraq and support international efforts to combat that terrorist organization. We also support the efforts of the Iraqi Government to achieve peace and stability and end sectarian practices, and stress in this context the importance of implementing reforms to ensure inclusiveness, fairness and equality for all segments and components of Iraqi society. For its part the United Arab Emirates will continue to support humanitarian aid programmes to help the people affected by conflict. It has become evident that the salvation of our region lies in building inclusive nations free from sectarian or religious affiliations used by parties for political purposes and which have led to chaos and bloodshed.
We are fully aware of the consequences of failing to take firm measures to prevent extremist and terrorist organizations from pursuing their destructive endeavours, especially in the Horn of Africa, as we have seen done by exploiting those who do not share their
2/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
views. We commend the efforts of the Government of Somalia and its efforts to fight Al-Shabaab. We urge them to continue taking the necessary measures to restore stability and peace and reiterate our support for such efforts to achieve that objective. Therefore, we stress the need to intensify and pool our efforts in order to combat the threats of these organizations wherever they are, and to address the root causes of radical ideologies before they turn into violent extremism.
We have been committed to supporting regional and international efforts, including those aimed at combating ISIL. We have also contributed to hosting the Hedayah Centre to assist the international community in building capacities and exchanging best practices to counter all forms of extremism. We also host the Global Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies with a view to spreading a culture of tolerance and peace and promoting convergence between faiths. Recently, with the assistance of the United States, we launched the Sawab Centre in order to counter the social media messaging of ISIL and to allow moderate voices to reach the millions of people who reject terrorist practices and the misleading conceptions promoted by Daesh and other terrorist groups.
We believe that the security and stability of the States of the region depend on positive cooperation among its various agencies, which must adopt as their fundamental principle respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs. With regard to the statement made by the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran (see A/70/PV.13), we believe that Iran’s record does not qualify it to speak about the safety of the Hajj pilgrims. We support the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and reject all efforts aimed at interfering in its internal affairs.
We reject Iran’s continued occupation of the three United Arab Emirates islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, and call on Iran to return these islands. All actions and measures carried out by the Iranian authorities are contrary to international law and all norms and common values. We call on Iran to reach a just settlement of this issue either through serious direct negotiations between our two countries or by referring the issue to the International Court of Justice.
Despite all these challenges, the Palestinian issue remains at the core of conflict in our region, and one of the main threats to its security and stability. Moreover, the feelings of injustice and frustration resulting from
the continued Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and the flagrant human rights violations committed by the occupation forces provide extremist groups with an opportunity to exploit these serious humanitarian conditions and to spread their radical thinking and incite frustrated youth to implement their destructive agenda.
We call on the international community to seize the opportunity of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations to create effective international partnerships built on solidarity and a genuine desire to develop our countries and achieve security and prosperity for all.
"
70,2015,PRK,"I would like to congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at this historic seventieth session. I hope that his able stewardship will lead this session, under the theme “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”, to a successful outcome.
We are now at a critical point in time in which we are reflecting on the 70 years of the United Nations and defining the road ahead.
First and foremost, it is important to learn lessons from both the successes and the failures of the United Nations over the past 70 years. It is fortunate that
15-29876 7/26

A/70/PV.24 01/10/2015
humankind has evaded a third world war during this time. That should be considered a victory for the noble ideal of peace over war, which was an important source of inspiration leading to the founding of the United Nations. Since the start of the new millennium, the percentage of the world population living under the poverty line has been reduced by half. This amounts to a triumph for the ideal of cooperation for development, which, along with peace, represents one of the two main pillars of the United Nations.
Yet the world has not been at peace over the past 70 years, nor has humankind lived in comfort. The world has undergone hundreds of wars and armed conflicts, big and small, some of which drove us to the brink of a nuclear disaster. The peace sought by humankind is not fragile in nature, like a thin layer of ice, but rather it is as firm, durable and permanent as a rock. It is not the peace of a slave, requiring subservience to the master; it is a peace of dignity, a peace befitting an independent human being. Such peace remains only a dream for humankind.
The world has come a long way and tremendous changes have taken place. However, the United Nations system and its peacekeeping and security operations are not so very different from the old ones in the days when it was founded. The arbitrariness and undemocratic practices of the Security Council have not been redressed. Consequently, the United Nations, a hallowed international Organization, is constantly being abused and monopolized as a forum for confrontation by a few Powers. The result is that world peace and security are under constant threat and humankind has grown accustomed to having to live, against its will, with the smoky clouds of war overhead. This is the biggest failure overshadowing the 70-year history of the United Nations, as well as the greatest challenge we are facing on our road ahead.
Unless the sovereign equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations is fully translated into reality, the ongoing practice of domination, inequality and unfairness cannot be eradicated at the United Nations. Until international relations are democratized, the United Nations will not be able to fulfil its mission to safeguard international peace and security. Furthermore, the United Nations will be degraded to the point of becoming a haven in which the forces bent on disrupting and destroying peace and security camouflage their designs. This is the main lesson we
have learned as we look back on the 70 years of the United Nations.
Reflected on every page of the annals of the United Nations is the history of our national division, stained with the misfortunes and pains that our people have suffered over the past seven decades. The same year the United Nations was founded, our nation was liberated from Japanese colonial rule and divided into the north and the south by a foreign force. The same foreign force now sits on the Security Council as a permanent member State.
For the past seven decades — from its inception to today — the United Nations has been used as a tool to violate the sovereignty, dignity, peace and security of our nation. It was none other than the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea that granted so- called legitimacy to the manoeuvres of the United States, which had brought about the division of our nation by setting up a separate Government in South Korea in 1948. It was also in the name of the United Nations forces that the troops of the United States and 15 other satellite countries joined the Korean War in 1950.
At its thirtieth session, in 1975, the General Assembly adopted resolution 3390 B (XXX), on the subject of dissolving the United Nations Command and withdrawing foreign troops from South Korea. Like all the other resolutions that the United States voted against, this resolution also was not implemented.
At present, nearly 40,000 United States troops, a massive number, are stationed in South Korea—more than in any other foreign country. The Commander of the United States Forces Command in South Korea is also the United Nations Commander and so wears two hats. The so-called United Nations Commander commands the large-scale nuclear war exercises held several times a year by the United States of America and South Korea and has done so during the past seven decades.
Even in the twenty-first century, the Security Council continues to commit arbitrary acts against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in flagrant violation of justice and international law. Today, a body of international law exists that stipulates that the use of outer space is the sovereign right of every country. More than 10 countries have launched satellites. However, the Security Council passed a resolution prohibiting
8/26 15-29876

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea alone from launching satellites. Moreover, nine countries have already developed and conducted over 2,000 nuclear tests in total. But again, the Security Council adopted resolutions prohibiting the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea from conducting nuclear tests, which it did only three times.
In 2014, the United States launched yet another anti-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea smear campaign in the General Assembly and the Security Council on the basis of the detailed findings of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (see A/HRC/25/CRP.1), a report that relied on fabricated evidence, thereby demonstrating that the United Nations is still manipulated by the United States.
Our development of outer space technology for peaceful purposes is within our legitimate rights as a sovereign State. Our nuclear testing is a defensive measure to counter the hostile policy and nuclear threat of the United State of America. The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is steadfast in its resolve to uphold its dignity and rights and will continue to do so robustly and persistently by using all the defensive measures at its disposal to counter the unjust actions aimed at thwarting its peaceful launch of a satellite.
The Charter of the United Nations provides that the Security Council acts in accordance with the principles of justice and international law. However, the United Nations is now in a state of chaos, and it is difficult to determine whether it is the Charter or some Security Council resolution that takes precedence. Moreover, the fact that the Security Council, which is endowed with greater responsibility and power than any other body of the Organization, has become so reckless and is made a mockery of by an individual Power is a twenty-first century tragedy.
Late last August, the situation on the Korean peninsula moved once again towards the brink of war. In this case, the situation was triggered by a minor incident, whose cause remains unknown. However, it is apparent that such incidents occur every time that a large-scale joint military exercise conducted by the United States of America and South Korea reaches its zenith.
In exercising its right as a State Member of the United Nations, a right enshrined in the Charter, the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea brought to the attention of the Security Council the matter of the aggressive and provocative large-scale joint military exercises of the United States of America and South Korea. We requested the Council to place the matter on its agenda, as the military exercises constitute a serious threat to international peace and security. We also referred the August incident to the Security Council. However, every time the Security Council has remained silent on this issue.
What measure can the United Nations take when the so-called United Nations Commander himself commands the large-scale war exercises that create a vicious cycle of heightened tension? Other extremely strange phenomena have no logical explanation. Over 20 years have passed since the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea joined the United Nations. But in Panmunjom, the flags of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United Nations are hoisted opposite each other. In other words, the United Nations is in a state of war against one of its Member States and their guns are levelled against each other.
Successive United Nations Secretaries-General have stated that the United Nations Command mechanism was not under the control of the United Nations, and that only the Security Council could decide to dismantle it. In the long term, that means that as long as the United States is a permanent member of the Security Council with the right of veto, the United Nations Command cannot be dismantled. That establishes an equation in which the United Nations equals the United States of America, since the United Nations force on the Korean peninsula is made up of United States troops.
The United Nations should uphold the original purposes and principles of the Charter and address its abnormal relations with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, both in the interest of international peace and security and for the welfare and prosperity of the Korean nation. The August incident clearly showed the fragility of the current peace on the Korean peninsula, which is due to the abnormal relationship with the United Nations. A rational, in-depth analysis of that incident leads to the conclusion that the Korean Armistice Agreement, as written, can no longer maintain peace on the Korean peninsula. For the Korean Armistice Agreement has no provision regarding such aggressive and provocative large-scale war exercises. Replacing the Korean Armistice Agreement with a
15-29876 9/26

A/70/PV.24 01/10/2015
peace treaty first and foremost requires the United States of America to make a bold decision.
Although currently intra-Korean relations have been defused thanks to a great deal of effort, the atmosphere does not promise to be as durable as one would want. For the situation on the Korean peninsula is such that even a minor provocative act can aggravate tensions and freeze relations in an instant.
Since the experience of the August incident that made North-East Asia and the entire world watch with bated breath, it has been clear that replacing the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty without further delay is crucial. The safeguarding of peace on the Korean peninsula requires North Korea and South Korea to address certain issues. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States of America also have issues to address.
The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953 between the Korean People’s Army and the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army on one side and the so-called United Nations forces on the other. With all the other foreign troops withdrawn, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States of America are the only two parties in charge of the armed forces currently deployed on the Korean peninsula. The United States of America has wartime operational control of the South Korean army and also administers the Korean Armistice Agreement.
It is high time for the United States to step forward and sign a peace treaty. The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is ready to hold a constructive dialogue to prevent war and conflicts on the Korean peninsula, once the United States agrees to replace the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty and refrains from making accusations of provocation in the mass media. If the United States of America displays courage in making a policy change, the security environment on the Korean peninsula will improve dramatically and the security concerns of the United States of America will eventually be addressed. That is the best option and the best solution we can offer in this forum as we look back over the past 70 years and look forward to the road ahead.
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is strongly convinced that a peace treaty should replace the Korean Armistice Agreement as a means of ensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula and of redressing the abnormal relations between the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United Nations. We also believe that that would help the United Nations to remain true to its founding ideals and the purposes and principles of the Charter. For its part, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea pledges to make sincere and energetic efforts to that end.
"
70,2015,KOR,"I would first like to congratulate the United Nations on the seventieth anniversary of its founding, and Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, former Speaker of the Danish Parliament, on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventieth session.
The United Nations, established 70 years ago after the calamities of war, has been a beacon of hope for people all over the world, thanks to the trust and hope engendered by the spirit of the United Nations that made people its focus, despite the constraints of realpolitik. And despite the many challenges and criticisms directed at it, the United Nations has made tremendous contributions to promoting the common good of humankind. As we speak, the Blue Helmets of its peacekeeping operations, themselves a symbol of peace, are working to maintain international peace and security.
The adoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was a milestone in the history of human rights, while the establishment of the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court marked conspicuous progress towards institutionalizing the protection of human rights. The Millennium Development Goals, launched in 2000, have been the basis for the most successful poverty eradication campaign in the history of the United Nations, lifting hundreds of millions out of extreme poverty.
And few places in the world have seen the efforts of the United Nations make as much difference as the Republic of Korea. This year also has special meaning for my country, for it is one that brings both the joy of marking the seventieth anniversary of our liberation and the anguish attendant on the arrival 
of the seventieth year of our division. In the past 70 years, the Republic of Korea has risen above the ordeals of partition and war and gone on to achieve industrialization and democratization simultaneously. The United Nations has stood with the Republic of Korea from the founding of our Government to this very day. The values and ideals upheld by the United Nations — global peace, the promotion of human rights and shared prosperity — have embodied the vision of the Republic of Korea itself. And the future that Korea envisions is aligned with the aspirations of the United Nations. The challenges we have overcome and the successes we have achieved over the years are a testament to the possibilities for success of the goal of the United Nations for a better world.
Notwithstanding these efforts of the United Nations and the international community, humankind today is confronted with multiple simultaneous challenges in all corners of the world. Today, there is no shortage of conflicts, large and small, or of extremely violent civil wars. The surge in extremist groups that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant represents is now a global concern that needs to be urgently addressed. A single photo of Aylan Kurdi captures how such instability is unleashing the greatest humanitarian refugee crisis since the Second World War. Global climate change is threatening the lives of even our future generations; Ebola and other infectious diseases are causing countless victims and awakening us to the importance of health security.
Today, no one in our global village is free from these global and transnational threats and challenges. As the international order experiences these tectonic shifts, now, more than ever, is the time for the United Nations to once again light up the beacon of hope and to illuminate the path to promoting international peace and security, human rights and collective prosperity throughout the world. Above all, the international community should rally around the United Nations and return to the founding spirit of the Charter of the Organization, which, in its Preamble calls for faith “in the dignity and worth of the human person”. We must build a United Nations that is strong, we must carry the banner of renewed multilateralism, and we must bear in mind that the value of human dignity is based on freedom, human rights, justice and the rule of law.
As a nation that puts the peace and happiness of our global village at the centre of its diplomatic endeavours, we will spare no effort in supporting the
United Nations as it addresses the challenges faced by the international community, and we will highlight the ideals of humanism and the need to live up to those ideals. The drive by the United Nations to produce a new post-2015 development agenda is also anchored in this people-centred spirit. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), adopted at the Summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda three days ago (see A/70/PV.4), has set a historic milestone on the road to a better world that leaves no one behind.
Just half a century ago, the Republic of Korea was among the poorest countries in the world. Today, it is one of the world’s top 10 economies. In the course of achieving this “miracle on the Han River”, we drew immense strength from the assistance and development cooperation of the international community. In this regard, I believe the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will be a potential stepping stone to a second and third miracle around the world.
The Republic of Korea, in its capacity as the current President of the Economic and Social Council, which will be playing a key role in the implementation of the development agenda, will actively contribute to achieving the development goals. Along the way, the Republic of Korea will proactively share its development experiences and know-how with the international community. In the meantime, we have been sharing with the developing countries the experiences of the Saemaul Undong, which served as a springboard for my country’s leap forward. I believe that the Saemaul Undong can maximize the utility of development cooperation with developing countries, given that it ignites a sense of confidence and ownership through competition and incentives and lays the groundwork for self-help in communities with the engagement of the local people.
Two days ago, we and the United Nations Development Programme and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development hosted a special high-level side event on the Saemaul Undong and agreed to work together to help eradicate poverty and build transformative local communities in developing countries. We will further expand our efforts so that the Saemaul Undong can progress as a new paradigm for rural development in developing countries.
Another important driving force behind our economic development is the human talent that has been nurtured through unsparing investment. Education
is the key element of the sustainable development agenda that helps to empower the individual and assist countries in attaining national development. We have been actively engaging in the Global Education First Initiative as a champion country. We hosted the World Education Forum 2015 with UNESCO last May, which culminated in the adoption of the Incheon Declaration and set the global education goals to be achieved by 2030. Going forward, the Republic of Korea is determined to continue its efforts in the area of education. In particular, we will continue to work with UNESCO to spread global citizenship education.
Next, Korea will also play a strong role in reinforcing global health security. In addition to dispatching a disaster response team to Sierra Leone to help fight Ebola late last year, at the second high-level meeting of the Global Health Security Agenda held in Seoul three weeks ago, the Republic of Korea announced that it would contribute $100 million over the next five years to support capacity-building in developing countries. Moreover, in support of developing countries over the next five years, it plans to pursue projects worth $200 million under the Better Life, Better Future Initiative.
Even as we were achieving rapid industrialization, we were expending a great deal of energy on ensuring the harmonious coexistence of humankind and nature. Our designation of 5 April as Arbor Day and the promotion of forestation has led to a twentyfold increase in the number of trees per hectare over the past 50 years. Since 1972, we have designated green belt zones to curb development in the suburbs, thereby achieving harmony between the environment and development. Today, we are channelling our environmental advocacy into joining the international community’s response to climate change.
Dealing with climate change is an urgent task that we can no longer afford to put off. It is critical that the international community produce a concrete and meaningful outcome at the 2015 session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change this December. We believe that addressing climate change is not a burden, but a fresh opportunity to create future drivers of growth through technological innovation.
Guided by that belief, the Republic of Korea submitted a forward-looking intended nationally determined contribution last June. It is considering how to make the transition to a low-carbon economy and
actively participating in the climate negotiations. In addition, as the host country of the Green Climate Fund Secretariat and the Global Green Growth Institute, Korea will continue to support climate action by developing business models for new energy industries and sharing them with developing countries.
The recent United Nations review of peace operations, peacebuilding and women and peace and security in line with a changing security environment could not have come at a better time. As a country that experienced a devastating war and remains scarred to this day by partition, the Republic of Korea is acutely aware of the importance of peace and is strongly supporting the efforts of the United Nations to protect peace.
To date, my country has dispatched some 13,500 peacekeepers to 18 missions. Korean peacekeepers are held in high regard for their exemplary and community- friendly peacekeeping and reconstruction activities. Following consultations with the United Nations, the Republic of Korea plans in the near future to make additional deployments to peacekeeping missions, and we will strengthen our substantive partnership with the African Union.
To assist Syrian refugees fleeing the instability in the Middle East, the Republic of Korea will step up its humanitarian assistance to the relevant countries. It is also focusing its attention on laying the groundwork for peace in North-East Asia, a region that continues to experience persistent tensions and discord among countries. In North-East Asia, we see a deepening of the Asia paradox phenomenon, where political and security cooperation lags behind the high degree of economic interdependence among the countries in the region.
Recently, moves that could potentially have profound consequences for North-East Asia’s security order have led to misgivings among countries in the region. Japan’s new defence and security legislation should be implemented transparently and in a way that is conducive to friendly relations among the countries of the region and to regional peace and stability. Referring to North-East Asia with its continuing tensions and discord, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon once described the lack of a regional cooperation mechanism as a “crucial missing link”. The reason that I proposed the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative was to remedy that omission and thereby
create a virtuous cycle of trust-building and increased cooperation.
Consultations among the countries of the region are currently under way on a range of potential areas of collaboration, including nuclear security, disaster management and health. The region’s cumulative experience in those areas will help to promote global peace and cooperation. Such efforts on our part will also help to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, which poses a serious threat to peace in North-East Asia and beyond. Resolving the North Korean nuclear issue should be accorded the highest priority if we are to safeguard the integrity of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and live up to the aspirations of humankind for a world without nuclear weapons.
A nuclear deal with Iran was reached in July. The international community should now focus its efforts on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, which is the last remaining non-proliferation challenge.
In recent weeks, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea once again publicly hinted at further acts of provocation that would violate the terms of Security Council resolutions. That would not only spoil the mood for the inter-Korean dialogue—which took so long to create—but would also undermine the efforts of the countries participating in the Six-Party Talks to reopen denuclearization talks. The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would do well to choose reform and openness, over additional provocations, and to endeavour to free the people from hardship. Pushing ahead with provocations, including its nuclear development programme, will undermine the values of world peace espoused by the international community and the United Nations. If the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea resolutely gives up its nuclear ambitions and chooses the path of openness and cooperation, the Republic of Korea will work with the international community to actively support North Korea in developing its economy and improving the quality of life of its people.
Over the course of the past 10 years, the United Nations has made significant progress, not least in terms of protecting human rights and advancing freedom. Member States formally accepted the concept of the responsibility to protect at the 2005 United Nations World Summit, and legal accountability for those involved in genocide was defined with the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and
the International Criminal Court. I believe that we should further strengthen the responsibility to protect in order to prevent the humanitarian crises our world currently faces from deteriorating further.
Last year, at this very rostrum, I stressed that sexual violence against women during armed conflict, whenever or wherever it may take place, is unquestionably a violation of human rights and humanism. This year marks the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. The international community should do justice to the occasion by paying greater attention to sexual violence against women in conflict situations. The most compelling reason is the fact that only a few of the victims of brutal sexual violence during the Second World War are alive today. Solutions that can bring healing to the hearts of those still living need to be devised promptly. The efforts made by the United Nations High Commissioners of Human Rights and Special Rapporteurs on this issue must not be allowed to come to nothing. There will be no unlocking the future if the past is not acknowledged.
We now hope that the spirit of enduring partnership with humankind that the United Nations embodies will resonate far and wide so that past wounds can be healed and a new future can unfold. One issue that has attracted great international attention in the realm of human rights over the past year is the human rights situation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, issued in February 2014, called for the active response of the international community to address the human rights issue in that country. In the wake of the report’s release, not only did the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly adopt relevant resolutions, but no less an organ than the Security Council took up the issue for discussion. We once again call on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to heed the concerns of the international community and to take steps to improve its human rights situation.
Last year in the General Assembly (see A/69/PV.6), I proposed that a world ecopeace park be built as a space in which to dream dreams of peace within the demilitarized zone, the symbol of a divided Korean peninsula. However, the recent landmine incident in the demilitarized zone brought home the inescapable reality that peace on the Korean peninsula can be jeopardized in a single moment. Fortunately, the two
Koreas managed to reach an agreement on 25 August, following high-level talks, and are now at a juncture that may lead to a virtuous cycle of trust and cooperation. The impetus for moving this new virtuous cycle forward will come from the faithful implementation of the 25 August accord and from the fulfilment by both Koreas of their commitment to take concrete steps for reconciliation and cooperation. We must no longer use political and military reasons as excuses for turning a blind eye to humanitarian issues, such as the reunion of separated families. I hope we can again embark on the path to regaining our common identity as one nation, through the official dialogue and the various exchanges provided for in the 25 August agreement.
Very shortly, on 3 October, the German people will be celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of their reunification. In 1948, the United Nations blessed the birth of the Republic of Korea. Soon, I hope, the day will come when the entire world celebrates the reunification of Korea. Ending the seven-decade-long history of a divided Korean Peninsula, the last remaining vestige of the Cold War, will amount to nothing less than a contribution to world peace.
Not long ago, the Republic of Korea organized a journey by rail called the Eurasia Friendship Express, which passed through Russia and went all the way to Europe. Those who made the journey were deeply touched and moved by it. However, the train was unable to go through the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea because the way was barred. I ask all those at the United Nations to lend us their strength in removing the barriers to unification and to make it possible for the spirit of peace to suffuse the Korean Peninsula.
A peacefully unified Korea will be a thriving democratic nation, free of nuclear weapons and steadfast in upholding human rights. What is more, a unified Korean Peninsula, both as a symbol of peace in our global village and a new engine of growth, will contribute greatly to peace and prosperity in North- East Asia and beyond. I hope that the United Nations and all peace-loving countries will work together so that the ideals of peace and human dignity dreamt of by the founders of the United Nations 70 years ago can also be fulfilled through the unification of the Korean Peninsula.
On this grand journey towards a better world, members can rest assured that the Republic of Korea will be a companion that the United Nations and the international community can count on.
"
70,2015,MDV,"The first three words of the Charter of the United Nations reads “We the peoples”. Those words make it clear that human life is at the heart of the Charter of the United Nations. It must remain the key principle guiding our work.
This year, we mark the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the Charter, 70 years since the establishment of the United Nations. There is not a more opportune time to ask ourselves, “Have we served ‘we the peoples’ well?” The answer to that question is probably “yes”. I say that because succeeding generations have been saved from the scourge of inter-State war.
Yet we remain unable to counter intra-State conflict. Our faith in fundamental human rights is reaffirmed in principle, yet the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small are ignored. The rule of law and the values of good governance are advocated for some but ignored for others. We promised to promote social progress and better standards of life, and, yes, extreme poverty has been reduced significantly; more children than ever are going to school. Yet the gap between the rich and the poor is widening, and ignorance and intolerance are rampant. The Charter failed to recognize
15-29946 13/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
the environment as an issue of importance, and we fail the environment every day.
Despite all that, the United Nations is the best hope for humankind. And it must remain relevant. If we want the United Nations to become more resilient, face the emerging challenges of our time, give hope to the many who perish in dire situations, inspire courage in the face of adversity and protect the rights of nations regardless of size, then the United Nations must be reformed.
Last week, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which recognizes at its core that development must be holistic, that poverty is a multidimensional problem, and that what matters is the human being, whose rights must be protected and promoted. Yet here in the United Nations we remain trapped in silos, hiding away behind the excuse of mandates. Why is it that the only issue the Security Council can discuss is guns and bombs, that the Economic and Social Council cannot discuss war and peace, that development and war cannot have a human rights dimension, that specific issues have to be confined to a specific body?
We believe that every problem can and should be looked at from every angle. That is the only way of responding to crises in a sustainable manner. In the real world, neither real problems nor real solutions fit neatly into separate compartments. A new way of approaching the global challenges of our time is necessary, so let us start organizing our work differently.
One important way of doing that is to redefine the concept of security: to include all issues that threaten all of humankind, including climate change. For us in the Maldives, climate change is a security threat. It damages our economy, deprives us of our rights, our land and our way of life and threatens the very existence of our nation. When young children play by the beach, the waves lapping at their feet, when a fisherman looks to the sea for the day’s catch and when we feel the cool breeze of the ocean caressing us, it seems inconceivable that those same waters may become our watery grave.
The Maldives is ready to act. We have always been the first in line. Together with other small island developing States (SIDS), we have taken urgent action to keep the rise of global temperature below 1.5°C . We are reducing our emissions. We are working in good faith towards a legally binding agreement in Paris this year. If we, the smallest can act, why cannot the biggest?
The health of the oceans is another issue that demands attention. The oceans are intimately linked with our lives and livelihoods. Oceans and their wealth are the drivers of our economy, the source of our food and the backbone of our heritage and traditions. Unless we sustain the wealth of the oceans, we can achieve nothing. That is why the Maldives banned turtle poaching in the early eighties, declared a biosphere reserve in 2012 and made its entire area a shark sanctuary. We understand the value of our oceans and all the treasures they contain. Our oceans are home to some of the most valuable marine habitats in the world, yet the illicit exploitation of natural resources, maritime piracy and other criminal activities threaten and undermine the peace and security of our countries.
Building the resilience of our people must remain at the centre of all our efforts, abroad and at home. That is why President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom’s Government has embarked on a national development programme based on empowerment, especially of the young and of children and women. We believe that investing in people is the best way to promote human rights, to guarantee a brighter future for the generations to come and to ensure that the democratic gains we have made are consolidated and further enhanced.
The Maldives is a nation that is governed by the rule of law. Our strong commitment to upholding the rule of law will continue, regardless of a person’s position in society and even in cases where it is most inconvenient to do so. I can assure Member States that we will not fail in that endeavour.
The United Nations rose from the ashes of war and destruction at a time when swarms of refugees were crossing borders and seas, leaving everything behind to seek safety and security and to save their own lives and their children’s. We have gone through those times and built a better, more integrated, more tolerant world. Fear of the other did not overtake humankind.
Today, as we see similar pictures of girls and boys, women and men seeking safety from war and certain death, I urge everyone to show compassion. A good start can be made by using the right term: it is a refugee, not a migrant, crisis. The refugees are running away from senseless violence — barbarism that is being carried out by terrorist groups in the name of Islam. The Maldives condemns the acts of those groups, which are not only un-Islamic but also anti-Islamic. They are fuelling the rise of Islamophobia around the world.
14/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
The international community must not let those groups redefine our beautiful religion of peace, tolerance and compassion.
We thought that apartheid had been dismantled, yet Israel pursues apartheid policies in occupied Palestine and the world remains indifferent. Three days ago, we witnessed the raising of the Palestinian flag here at the United Nations. That was indeed a historic step, but if Palestine were to attain full membership in the United Nations that would be a much more significant step. A permanent solution would involve the complete withdrawal of Israel and the establishment of the State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem at its capital, within the 1967 borders.
The small island developing States of the world are different from the large States. We face different kinds of challenges that require very different responses. That is a fact that everyone now recognizes. However, the international architecture, including the United Nations system, is not designed to accommodate the unique features of small States. That needs to change, and changes need to happen now. We, the small States, do not want to be defined only by our vulnerabilities. We are ready to be part of the solution. In Samoa last year, the SIDS called for the building of partnerships as the way forward. Alone we might be weak, but united we can move mountains.
We in the Maldives have always believed that we can do anything we set our mind to, as long as we remain sincere in our intention and unwavering in our commitment. And the United Nations has never failed to inspire us in our resolve. That is why the Maldives joined the United Nations less than two months after gaining independence. Just a few days ago, we celebrated 50 years of our membership. The United Nations has served us well, and we are committed to expanding and further strengthening that valuable partnership.
Though short of finances, we have no shortage of smart ideas. Our former President, Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, was the first to speak about the issue of sea-level rise from this rostrum. We were the first to introduce the concept of the security of small States to the United Nations and the first to start advocating here in the Assembly for the link between human rights with climate change. And we remain relentless in our pursuit of those issues, not only because it is good for the Maldives, but because it is also good for humankind.
Fifty years ago, when we applied for United Nations membership, some doubted our ability to survive and questioned our capacity to contribute. After 50 years of United Nations membership, I say to those sceptics that we are not only willing, we are also able. We are not only viable, we are also valuable. And as Maldivians, we are proud of what we have achieved.
"
70,2015,PER,"It is an honour for me to address the General Assembly and to convey my congratulations to President Lykketoft on his election. Peru is ready to contribute to the success of his mandate.
Seventy years ago, we established the United Nations Organization so as to maintain international peace and security, promote and protect human rights and cooperate at the international level for the development of our peoples. We now renew our commitment to its purposes and principles and affirm the need to continue working to ensure that its vision becomes a tangible reality for all and that we leave future generations a sustainable planet.
My country is particularly proud to have been a founding member of the Organization and to have steadfastly been committed to its Charter and to multilateralism. We would like now to recall three illustrious Peruvians who held three high-ranking posts: Ambassador Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, who was Secretary-General; the former President of Peru, José Luis Bustamante y Rivero, who was President of the International Court of Justice; and Mr. Víctor Andrés Belaúnde, who was President of the General Assembly.
There is no doubt that the United Nations system has contributed, and continues to contribute, a great deal to the progress of humankind. We must realize that, for over 70 years, we have not seen another major war such as the ones that beset the world in the first half of the twentieth century, nor has there been an economic crisis of the magnitude of the Great Depression. However, there is no doubt that the achievements of the United Nations have not reached everyone equally. The world compels us to rethink what kind of Organization it is that we need and to redouble our efforts to ensure that peace and security, human rights and sustainable development are truly universal.
Peru attaches the greatest importance to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). We have agreed to transform the world in a single
8/18 15-29940

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27
generation in a process throughout which our people have been heard and our cultural diversity has been acknowledged as a catalyst for development. For the first time in history, humankind has a universal instrument through which we have committed ourselves to eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions and to achieving sustainable development over the next 15 years without leaving anyone behind. In fact, we have decided to strengthen and renew the global partnership for sustainable development. In line with Peru’s priorities for social inclusion, we are happy to see that the 2030 Agenda reflects that same transformational character throughout.. We must be inclusive in order to grow, and we must give priority to the economic and social groups that have been left behind and those that are most vulnerable, which, more often than not, include indigenous peoples, the elderly, persons with disabilities and migrants.
In order to implement the new Agenda it is essential to allocate sufficient resources. We need to increase the budgets for programmes that involve social inclusion, especially in the fields of health and education, giving priority to the care of our children, gender equality and the empowerment of women. Peru considers it vital to adopt at the twenty-first meeting of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December, a universally binding, ambitious and balanced agreement to address climate change. As the current Acting President of that Conference, Peru is sparing no effort to reach that goal, in accordance with the Lima Call for Climate Action. Climate change and environmental challenges are endless. The experts say that we will be facing a particularly serious situation with regard to El Niño over the next few years. We must invest more in disaster prevention and risk reduction as part of our development plans. Peru, a country of stupendous biodiversity, would also like to call attention to the great potential of biodiversity for development. In that regard, we are particularly concerned about the preservation and sustainable use of land and sea ecosystems.
As is the case with sustainable development, the United Nations must make strides in the area of international peace and security in order to ensure respect for and promotion of human rights. Peru commends the important progress that has been made towards achieving peace in the sister Republic of Colombia. We also welcome the restoration of relations between the Republic of Cuba and the United States,
and we again appeal for an end to the economic and financial blockade.
Concerning the question of Palestine, the Security Council must be proactive in promoting a dialogue that leads to direct negotiations. Palestinians and Israelis should live together in peace and should prosper in two States within secure and internationally recognized borders. The status quo is unsustainable. Peru reaffirms its commitment to defending and promoting human rights, the rule of law, the peaceful resolution of disputes and conflict prevention.
We believe that the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court should be universally recognized. We therefore encourage States that have not yet done so to fully accede to their respective statutes. We must strengthen our ability to react to humanitarian crises and prevent impunity for atrocities. No State can ignore the responsibility to protect human beings. Peru deplores the situation that has developed in Syria and the evil crimes of the so-called Islamic State.
We must ensure the continued legitimacy of the Security Council. It is vital that we work to achieve its comprehensive reform, both in its composition and working methods and by restricting the use of the veto, if we are to ensure its representativeness and effectiveness. In that regard, Peru has been working within the Accountability, Consistency and Transparency group on the adoption of a code of conduct that can guide the Security Council’s action where heinous crimes are concerned.
Aware of the new tasks included in the mandates of peacekeeping operations, Peru will be sending an engineering company to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic, the first time that a Peruvian company has deployed outside our region.
Peru has been working to deal decisively and effectively with the global drug problem. In that regard, we have been implementing a successful strategy with a comprehensive approach that includes actions aimed at prevention, control and interdiction, as well as sustainable alternative development programmes for farmers. In the past year, as a result of that strategy, we recorded a net reduction in illicit crops that was almost 14 per cent greater and cocaine seizures that were 40 per cent higher than the figures for 2013. In the past year alone, we expanded our alternative development
15-29940 9/18

A/70/PV.27 02/10/2015
programmes to cover more than 50,000 hectares, and we have reforested about 15,000 hectares that had been affected by illicit crops. The special session in 2016 that the General Assembly will devote to the scourge of drugs should reaffirm full enforcement of the international conventions relating to drugs and the commitment to addressing the problem through national strategies.
We also consider it very important to continue promoting an environment conducive, at every level, to effective arms control, including limiting conventional weapons and enforcing the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We reaffirm our commitment to the Arms Trade Treaty and the principles of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, without prejudice to the inalienable right of all States to research and produce nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
As I noted at the beginning of my statement, the international community is taking on the ambitious task of transforming the world by eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development through its implementation of the 2030 Agenda. In order to achieve the new Agenda’s Goals, States will have to significantly increase the resources that they dedicate to the implementation of the Goals and strengthen international cooperation in every way. A renewed global partnership should also strengthen cooperation in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation and promote confidence-building measures aimed at preventing conflicts, arms races and humanitarian crises, because without peace there can be no development. Seventy years after its creation, this Organization can and should contribute to making a reality of the future we all want.
"
70,2015,KEN,"It is a pleasure for me to be addressing the General Assembly at its seventieth session. Let me begin by congratulating the President on his election at this historic session. We are confident that his vast diplomatic experience will enable him to steer the proceedings and contribute to the achievement
of the objectives that he has set. Kenya fully supports his leadership and will constructively engage with him as we strive to realize those objectives.
Seventy years ago, in the aftermath of the Second World War, the United Nations was established with the objective of saving succeeding generations from the recurrence of war. Thereafter, the world took up the challenge of defeating colonialism and its ideologies. That era was also seen as the precursor to greater global equality, increased social equity and the beginning of the fight against mass poverty. It also led to the growth of democracy and freedom.
Today, the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is being celebrated against a backdrop of numerous global challenges. The adverse effects of globalization, the debilitating consequences of the world economic and financial crisis and the negative effects of climate change have increased the vulnerability of the global economy and affected the States Members of the United Nations to varying degrees. Today, as in the past 70 years, the challenges faced by developing countries, together with their aspirations, including peace and security, development, the protection of human rights, environmental conservation and global governance, remain as real and relevant as ever. They are expected to continue to be the primary concerns for a number of Member States over the coming years.
The maintenance of international peace and security continues to face increasing challenges owing to the growing intensity and complexity of conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, especially in the Great Lakes region, the Horn of Africa and the Sahel. The continuing grave security situation in Eastern Africa and further afield is of particular concern to Kenya, which has continued to invest millions of dollars in the maintenance of regional peace and security, while many Kenyans have lost their lives in the quest for peace. We therefore urge the international community, in particular the Security Council, to shoulder its responsibilities in such a way as to make a direct impact in the resolution of those conflicts.
There is a need to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, to provide access to justice for all and to build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels, as stated in Goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals, in order to realize sustainable peace all over the world.
Global terrorism and violent extremism remain a major threat not only to the Republic of Kenya, but also to the entire world. To date, Al-Shabaab terrorists have been targeting the civilian population in Kenya on the pretext that Kenya has deployed its troops in Somalia. The continued threat by Al-Shabaab has had a major impact on Kenya’s national security and economy in general. Kenya therefore calls upon the international community to take strong and enforceable action in combating Al-Shabaab, together with other terrorist groups, including foreign fighters. At the same time, we must collectively address the radicalization of youth as the pipeline for global terrorism, including its financing at the grass-roots level, where most young people are radicalized.
Somalia is an important neighbour of Kenya. Kenya and Somalia share strong historical, cultural and trading ties that have benefited both societies. Somalia remains of major concern to the international community, and to Kenya in particular, owing to long-standing crises and the security situation, which remains a grave threat to peace and security in the East Africa region and throughout the Horn of Africa. While Al-Shabaab’s capacity to launch terrorist acts inside Somalia has greatly diminished owing to the presence of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and its troops, Al-Shabaab’s continued presence in Somalia has a negative impact on the security, stability and prosperity of that country. The Kenya Defence Forces, within the framework of AMISOM, will continue working closely with the Somali National Army.
In spite of the threat posed by Al-Shabaab to Kenya, we will continue to stand firm in support of the Somali Government and the people of Somalia. We therefore call on the international community to support the Federal Government of Somalia in securing its territory. We remain committed, together with other international partners, to providing the necessary support to the Federal Government of Somalia in implementing its Vision 2016.
Kenya is also preocupied by the emerging governance and humanitarian crisis in South Sudan in the aftermath of the political crisis that occurred in 2013. The crisis in South Sudan remains an issue of great concern not only to Kenya, but to the region of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and to the larger international community. Kenya welcomes the recently signed peace treaty, calls upon both parties to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict
and urges the international community, especially the United Nations, to support the IGAD-Plus peace process and other initiatives geared to the realization of a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace in South Sudan. That should be achieved through the enforcement of the peace and security arrangements, support for the institutions of governance and democracy, support for the demilitarization of South Sudan and a response to the current humanitarian crisis. South Sudan needs to find the path of peace, development and reconstruction, and that needs to happen urgently.
At the beginning of this millennium we adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Since then, the MDGs have galvanized and catalysed international action in support of eradicating poverty and realizing other social targets. The MDGs demonstrated that a set of development goals and targets could be important drivers of change. Indeed, where successfully implemented, the MDGs have had a positive impact on the lives of millions of people. But, at best, the results have been uneven. Many developing countries remain off track and have not been able to meet their 2015 deadline.
It was therefore necessary to begin a global process to shape a new development agenda, with the starting point being the unfinished business of the MDGs and the creation of a truly transformative and inclusive development agenda as was agreed at the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, held in Rio de Janeiro. The new Agenda — Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) — therefore seeks to address transformative challenges that cut across the social, economic and environmental dimensions of development. But transformative and inclusive development does not mean that we can abandon our responsibility to support the countries in the greatest need. On the contrary, as the international community, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that no one is left behind and that no country is left behind.
The year 2015 will be remembered in history as the time when it was decided at important conferences that the world should be on a sustainable development path. These began with the third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in March, then the third International Conference on Financing for Development in July, and the General Assembly, with its very recent adoption of the new Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), whose ambitious
outcome has put us on a a new sustainable development path, with a new set of Goals. The forthcoming Paris session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is also expected to reach an inclusive, balanced, ambitious and acceptable climate change agreement, including its financing, that, we hope, will this time turn plans into actions. The Paris Conference must succeed; failure in this case cannot be an option.
The third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, held in Sendai, Japan, underscored the importance of promoting efforts to reduce disaster risks at the international and regional levels, as well as at the national and local levels. The Conference noted that the cost of addressing disaster risk remained a huge burden to many countries. As a result, efforts to address poverty eradication and food security, among other challenges, have continued to be undermined.
Going forward, the Conference agreed that it would be important to mitigate the risks of disaster by implementing resilience measures. Member States would have to undertake to reduce disaster losses in terms of lives and the social, economic and environmental assets of communities. The Conference called for the full commitment and involvement of all actors concerned, in particular Governments, regional and international organizations and civil society, including volunteers, the private sector and the scientific community.
The Conference also called on Governments to mobilize the required means of implementation in order to address disaster risk reduction, which involves building capacities, especially in defining risk and mainstreaming risk pricing, in order to inform priorities in public expenditures. For effective implementation, capacity-building should cover enhanced global risk analysis and extend to local authorities and others at the subnational level. In order to address risk reduction, sound follow-up mechanism for monitoring and accountability are needed. We are glad to note that disaster risk reduction is part of the new Sustainable Development Agenda.
At the third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in July in Addis Ababa, important decisions were reached to follow up on the commitments made in Monterrey and Doha and to further strengthen the financing of the sustainable development framework. The Conference outcome
document focused on both financial and non-financial means of implementation. The required resources will have to be obtained through domestic resource mobilization, domestic and international private finance, business finance and international public finance, which includes official development assistance (ODA).
However, domestic resource mobilization remains key in raising the resources needed to finance development. That means addressing fiscal constraints in the available fiscal space and strengthening the capacities of tax authorities. The non-financial means, which include international trade as an engine of development, debt and debt sustainability, and the taking on of system,ic issues, have also to be implemented. This being said, the role of ODA remains key to upholding the credibility of international development cooperation. It is therefore imperative that development partners continue to redouble their efforts to support and finance programmes in developing countries.
Kenya places great importance on domestic resource mobilization to cover both its recurrent and its development commitments. We have noted the importance of public international finance as a complement to domestic public resources, and we have therefore put in place a national external resources policy with emphasis on sourcing concessional or semi-concessional support for key projects. To effectively coordinate the architecture for the delivery of external aid, we have put in place initiatives to fully implement the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Kenya therefore remains committed to adopting appropriate follow-up and review mechanisms, which will ensure that all the means of implementation are reviewed periodically. Going forward, we need to address capacity deficits in key institutions, such as our national statistical offices, in order to enable them to capture the timely and reliable data required for the follow-up and review process.
I wish to express my appreciation to the Secretary- General for the successful outcome of the Summit on the post-2015 development agenda. A few days ago, we adopted a bold, ambitious and transformative Agenda for Sustainable Development for the next 15 years. This pact was a culmination of more than three years of intergovernmental negotiations, which began with the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. We are glad to note that the Agenda recognizes as its overarching goal ending poverty
in all its forms everywhere. The Goals and targets set by the Agenda are universal and will apply to all countries, while different realities and capabilities are nevertheless recognized.
This new Agenda acknowledges that sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security; at the same time, peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development. That calls for building peaceful, inclusive and well-governed societies, with responsive institutions as the basis for shared prosperity. Fundamentally, the Agenda recognizes that we cannot reach our development goals without addressing human rights and complex humanitarian issues at the same time.
The Agenda addresses the requirements for all humankind to be able to live decent lives, free from poverty, hunger and inequality, with all men and women, girls and boys, able to develop their full potential. It commits all of us to being responsible global citizens, caring for the less fortunate and for our planet’s ecosystem and making action commitments regarding the climate, on which all life depends. It is important to note that the Agenda received valuable inputs from civil society, the private sector, academia and parliamentarians, as well as from millions of people from every corner of the world who shared their vision of the world we want.
Kenya is proud and honoured to have played an important role in the post-2015 development agenda process by co-chairing the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and by co-facilitating the intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. It is now the responsibility of all countries to implement this new universal development Agenda. The relevant means for achieving this have been developed and integrated into the Sustainable Development Goals, to be complemented by the outcome of the third International Conference on Financing for Development, to which I referred earlier. Implementation and follow-up will be critical. We will therefore need all partners on board to make it a success.
To complete our new path to sustainable development, all of us in Kenya look forward to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in November and December. COP21 is a crucial conference, during which global leaders will need the political will to reach the
expected outcome that will enable the Conference to achieve a new international agreement on climate that is applicable to all countries, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2°C. We therefore commend the efforts of France and all others in facilitating the United Nations search for consensus in climate negotiations. Similarly, Kenya will continue to constructively engage to ensure that we reach a meaningful universal climate change agreement that takes into account the issues affecting the developing world.
Kenya is happy to note that the efforts to deepen our regional integration within the East African Community continue to bear fruit. The East African Community remains one of the fastest-growing regional integration bodies and we hope this will continue. The East African Community is committed to widening and deepening cooperation among partner States in political, economic and social fields for our mutual benefit. Over the years, the East African Community has expanded its membership from three founding partners to five, which are now Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. This signifies a wider market that bears great strategic and geopolitical significance and prospects for a renewed and reinvigorated East African Community.
Much progress has been made and recorded in the East African Community since the establishment of the East African Customs Union in 2005. We are glad that much more progress continues to be recorded since the establishment of the Common Market in 2010. The Protocol Establishing the East African Monetary Union is already in place and its implementation under way. We remain committed to fast-tracking the process toan East African federation as a demonstration of the determination of the people of East Africa to construct a powerful and sustainable East African economic and political bloc.
Looking into the future, the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has brought a new dawn for global development. We must collectively avoid the pitfalls of the past 70 years. We must, as a matter of priority, focus all efforts towards ending poverty and promoting sustainable peace and security. We should remain ambitious, yet at the same time practical, in order to bring real change to the lives of the poor around the world, as well as to guarantee the sustainability of our planet.
Kenya will remain robust in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We will build on our experience from the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). At the same time, Kenya will continue to pay special attention to fundamental sustainable development issues that were previously left out of the MDG framework, especially strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing global partners for sustainable development, as well as the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies, which remains critical to the realization of peace, security and sustainable development.
In conclusion, I assure the Assembly that Kenya remains committed to continuing to play its rightful role in the global community, remain an anchor of peace and security in our region, and foster regional, continental and global cooperation for accelerated economic and social development and prosperity for all.
"
70,2015,SSD,"On behalf of my President, His Excellency Mr. Salva Kiir Mayardit, I would like to congratulate the newly elected President of the General Assembly. We stand with his leadership. I also thank his predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa of Uganda, for his beautiful and successful tenure in office.
I would like to express our sincere gratitude for the pivotal role of the United Nations, and of many other friends, before, during and after the birth of our country, South Sudan, in July 2011. We commend this noble world body and its able leadership for firmly supporting our independence. We vividly remember the three days that the Secretary-General spent in Juba, dedicated himself to lecturing and advising us as independence neared. We congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon.
After going through so much for too long, the dream, aspiration and vision of the people of South Sudan for a country of their own were finally realized on 9 July 2011, with strong support from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the United Nations
15-29664 5/25

A/70/PV.23 01/10/2015
and the Troika. Almost one week thereafter, in this great Hall, the General Assembly took a historic step and endorsed our independence. We most enthusiastically thank the United Nations for that.
Having attained freedom for our country and its people, we, the leaders, wasted no time in pushing forward with the creation of institutions of good governance and democratic exercise. We started virtually from rubble, following the first civil war. However, our progress has been thwarted and marred by unjustified internal power feuds that resulted in a regrettable conflict that engulfed three of our country’s 10 states.
It is my pleasure and a relief to announce to the Assembly that this regrettable war and unnecessary bloodshed have been brought to an end. The people of South Sudan were yearning for peace, and on 26 August 2015 our President took the courageous step — with the help of IGAD, the Troika, China, Russia, the United Nations and so on — to sign a peace agreement with our brothers in the rebellion to silence the guns and end the civil war. This signature was immediately followed by the President’s declaration of a permanent ceasefire the next day. We must congratulate our people for this historic achievement of peace. I am sure it will be cemented by prosperity and happiness. We give credit to our neighbours and the international community at large. The next step now is for this body to quickly join and help us in terms of both humanitarian assistance and reconstruction as we vow to implement the agreement.
South Sudan is concerned about global and regional peace, security and respect for human rights. Though we have been tied down by our own difficulties, we are also mindful of our participation in global and regional strategies aimed at tackling threats of terrorism, environmental change and the like.
I commend the role that the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) played during the period leading up to our declaration of independence in 2011, and afterwards. Nonetheless, any renewal of the UNMISS mandate without consultations with and the consent of our Government would not be right and would therefore be unacceptable. It is a well-known fact that matters of that nature are sovereign and due consultation is imperative.
Committing crimes against the people we govern or violating human rights have never and shall never be condoned by our Government. Promoting and protecting
the safety of persons, families and communities and their physical and social well-being is a duty that we take very seriously. We will not allow impunity to reign. We are conscious of our obligations to humankind, and we respect the human rights charter contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related protocols. We respect the content and provisions of the Geneva Conventions and vow to strictly observe and apply them in our difficult and complex context. Since our independence, whenever we have received reports of human rights abuses by elements associated with our security institutions, we have investigated and immediately dealt with them in accordance with the law.
We are delighted to announce that through the efforts of IGAD, alongside the Troika, on 26 August His Excellency President Salva Kiir Mayardit not only signed the agreement but also declared the ceasefire. This ceasefire is holding surely in certain parts of the country — there is no doubt about that — but not in all, I must underscore. That is mainly attributable to the absence of a joint monitoring and verification mechanism installed on the ground and of funding from IGAD for that purpose. I urge IGAD to work more speedily on creating and designating that vital instrument for enforcing any meaningful ceasefire.
With respect to security arrangements, from 13 to 18 September the warring parties held a workshop in Addis Ababa, which ended with our Government delegation signing the minutes and a communiqué. Our brothers in the rebellion, however, declined to sign, for reasons best known to them. It is now incumbent upon “IGAD-Plus” to persuade the armed opposition to sign the minutes as quickly as possible. The announcement by the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) — our Government Army — about a week ago that it would move out of Juba to a location 25 kilometres away is further proof that our Government is committed to this agreement. That is a clear demonstration of the Government’s will to execute the accord. As the SPLA is already moving to redeploy, the international community needs to expeditiously provide the necessary funding to help build new army barracks in those forests.
As we embark on the implementation of the peace agreement, sanctions and travel restrictions imposed on our officials should no longer be an option. At this juncture, I urge all countries of good will to rush in with humanitarian, resettlement and development projects.
6/25 15-29664

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.23
There is no doubt that development and prosperity can quickly lead to cementing peace and stability. It is therefore crucial for the Government of South Sudan to remind international donors about the many pledges they made earlier but which have never been honoured.
More than at any other time in our conflict-riddled history, the upcoming post-conflict imperatives of resettlement, rehabilitation and disarmament require concerted financial and technical assistance from our many friends of goodwill around the world. Honouring the numerous pledges made in forums such as in Oslo in 2005 and 2014 and the International Engagement Conference hosted by the sisterly country of the United States in 2011 will go a long way in enabling the current peace agreement to be fully implemented, in order to meet the pressing need for humanitarian aid and post- conflict reconstruction.
We are firmly determined to correct the errors of the past and look forward to the future. I take this opportunity to appeal to all friends and supporters of South Sudan to rapidly step in to support the humanitarian process I alluded to previously — the processes of rehabilitation, peacebuilding, cantonment and national reconstruction. South Sudan is very resilient and its future is certainly full of hope, particularly with all the assistance and cooperation that the international community has to offer. We should not be subject to undeserved isolation and sanctions, given our level of fragility as a new country.
"
70,2015,PAK,"We congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at its the seventieth session. It acknowledges his distinguished career in public service. We share his commitment to building a more just and stable world. We also pay tribute to Mr. Sam Kutesa for his able stewardship of the sixty-ninth session.
Seventy years ago, the United Nations was created from the ruins of the most devastating war the world has ever witnessed. Its purpose was to build universal peace and prosperity on the basis of equitable principles, cooperation and collective action. Despite the constraints of the Cold War, the United Nations served the international community as a beacon of hope, a repository of freedom, an advocate of the oppressed and a vehicle for development and progress.
But we, the peoples of the United Nations, have not succeeded in beating arms into ploughshares or promoting universal prosperity and larger freedoms. Confrontation between major Powers has returned at a time when many parts of the world are in turmoil. Terrorism is spreading. Poverty and deprivation have yet to be overcome. Gross violations of human rights are rampant. We are witnessing human dislocation, with refugees and forced migrants on a scale not witnessed for over half a century. Our very existence is threatened by the wanton damage done to our planet’s life-sustaining systems.
Yet this is also a moment of opportunity. Today, our interdependent world possesses the financial, scientific and organizational capabilities to address the diverse and interrelated challenges that pose a common threat to all Member States. At the historic Summit held over the weekend, we collectively committed ourselves to achieving 17 Sustainable Development Goals with a view to promoting equitable and inclusive development for all our peoples. The real challenge remains to mobilize the collective political will and resources to ensure the comprehensive implementation of the Agenda we have solemnly endorsed. Pakistan has already initiated action on national goals to promote the post- 2015 development agenda. We are also creating a robust mechanism for the monitoring and implementation of these Goals and targets.
Later this year, in Paris, we will need to respond with common but differentiated responsibilities to the threat posed by climate change. Partisan interests must not stand in the way of an ambitious and collective commitment to halting and reversing the damage done to our planet.
On the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, we should strive to adapt the global Organization to respond effectively to the current and emerging challenges that confront us all. Pakistan supports the comprehensive reform of the United Nations, including of the Security Council. We need a Security Council that is more democratic, representative, accountable and transparent — a Council that reflects the interests of all Member States, in accordance with the principle of sovereign equality, not an expanded club of the powerful and privileged.
Peacekeeping has been one of the key responsibilities of the United Nations. Pakistan is proud of its historic and current role as a major troop-contributor. We regard
15-29562 39/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
it as our obligation to uphold international peace and security.
Pakistan is the primary victim of terrorism. We have lost thousands of lives, including those of civilians and soldiers, to terrorist violence. The blood that has been shed, including that of our innocent children, has reinforced our resolve to eliminate that scourge from our society. We will fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, irrespective of its sponsors. Our Operation Zarb-e-Azb is the largest anti-terrorism campaign against terrorists anywhere, involving over 180,000 members of our security forces. It has made substantial progress in cleansing our country of all terrorists and will conclude only when our objective has been accomplished. The operation is complemented by an all-inclusive national action plan that encompasses police and security actions, political and legal measures, and social and economic policy packages aimed at countering violent extremism.
The global threat of terrorism cannot be defeated unless we address its underlying causes. Poverty and ignorance are part of the problem. Extremist ideologies must be opposed. But the narrative of the terrorists must also be countered through the just resolution of the several instances of oppression and injustice against Muslims in various parts of the world. Unfortunately, some seek to use the global campaign against terrorism to suppress the legitimate right of occupied peoples to self-determination.
The rise and spread of terrorism across the Middle East today poses unprecedented security challenges. Wracked by violence, ethnic and sectarian conflicts and the rise of Daesh, several countries of the region are today a vortex of conflict and instability. Others are being sucked into the quagmire. The tragedy of Palestine has intensified. The accepted avenue for peace between Palestine and Israel, a two-State solution, appears further away today than ever before, due to the intransigent stance of the occupying Power. Yet, as I speak, the proud Palestinian flag is being raised just outside this Hall. We hope that that is just the first step. We look forward to welcoming Palestine as a full Member of the United Nations.
Muslims are suffering across the world. Palestinians and Kashmiris are oppressed by foreign occupation; minorities are persecuted; and there is discrimination against Muslim refugees fleeing persecution or war.
The international community must redress those injustices against the Muslim people.
We welcome the comprehensive nuclear agreement reached between Iran and the P5+1, which shows what diplomatic engagement and multilateralism can achieve, and augurs well for the peace and security of our region and beyond.
Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan underwent a positive transformation after the establishment of the National Unity Government in Kabul. In response to a request from the Afghan Government, and with the support of the international community, Pakistan has made strenuous efforts to facilitate the process of Afghan reconciliation. Indeed, dialogue was opened between the Afghan Government and the Taliban, which was an unprecedented first. Unfortunately, certain developments stalled the process. Thereafter, militant attacks intensified, which we unequivocally condemn. Pakistan will persist in its endeavour to help restart the dialogue process and to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan. However, we can do so only if we receive the requisite cooperation of the Afghan Government. Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan are in neither country’s interest. We are encouraged that the international community, including the major Powers, desires the continuation of the peace process in Afghanistan.
Pakistan greatly appreciates China’s proactive role in promoting peace and prosperity in Afghanistan and in our region. We welcome China’s vision of “One Belt, One Road”. The China-Pakistan economic corridor announced during President Xi Jinping’s visit to Pakistan earlier this year will spur regional economic integration and bring prosperity to the entire region and beyond. That is an inspiring model of South-South cooperation that should be emulated. We also welcome Russia’s greater focus on Asian cooperation. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which Pakistan will be joining this year as a full member, holds great promise for promoting regional connectivity.
The history of South Asia is one of missed opportunities. Among its dire consequences is the persistence of poverty and deprivation in our region. Development is my Government’s first priority and has underpinned my policy to build a peaceful neighbourhood. Our peoples need peace to prosper. Peace can be achieved through dialogue, not disengagement.

In 1997, when the composite dialogue was launched with India, our two countries agreed that it would encompass two principal items — Kashmir and peace and security — along with six other issues, including terrorism. The primacy and urgency of addressing those two issues is even more compelling today. Consultations with Kashmiris, who are an integral part of the dispute, are essential to evolving a peaceful solution. Since 1947, the Kashmir dispute has remained unresolved. Relevant Security Council resolutions have remained unimplemented. Three generations of Kashmiris have known only broken promises and brutal oppression. Over 100,000 have died in their struggle for self-determination. That is the most persistent failure of the United Nations.
When I assumed office as the Prime Minister of Pakistan in June 2013 for the third time, one of my first priorities was to normalize relations with India. I reached out to the Indian leadership to emphasize that our common enemy was poverty and underdevelopment. Cooperation, not confrontation, should define our relationship. Yet today, ceasefire violations along the Line of Control and the working boundary are intensifying, causing the deaths of civilians, including women and children. Wisdom dictates that our immediate neighbour should refrain from fomenting instability in Pakistan. The two countries should address and resolve the causes of tension and take all possible measures to avert further escalation. That is why I wish to take this opportunity to propose a new peace initiative with India, starting with measures that are the simplest to implement.
First, we propose that Pakistan and India formalize and respect the 2003 understanding for a complete ceasefire on the Line of Control in Kashmir. To that end, we call for the expansion of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan in order to monitor observance of the ceasefire. Secondly, we propose that Pakistan and India reaffirm that they will not resort to the use or the threat of the use of force under any circumstances. That is a central element of the Charter of the United Nations. Thirdly, steps must be taken to demilitarize Kashmir. Fourthly, both countries should agree to an unconditional mutual withdrawal from the Siachen glacier, the world’s highest battleground. Easing threat perceptions through such peace efforts will enable Pakistan and India to agree on a broad range of measures to address the peril posed by offensive and advanced weapons systems.
Pakistan neither wants, nor is engaged in, an arms race in South Asia. However, we cannot remain oblivious to the evolving security dynamics and arms build-up in our region, which obliges us to take essential steps to maintain our security. As a responsible nuclear-weapon State, Pakistan will continue to support the objectives of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We have maintained the highest standards of nuclear security and established an effective regime to ensure the safety and security of our nuclear facilities and stocks. South Asia needs strategic stability and this requires serious dialogue to achieve nuclear restraint, conventional balance and conflict resolution.
Finally, we look forward to playing our part to build a brighter era of peace and prosperity in South Asia. We owe it to our people and to succeeding generations.
"
70,2015,LVA,"As we celebrate 70 years of the United Nations and 70 years since the end of the Second World War, it is time for us all to take stock. What has been achieved? Where have we failed? What is there yet to do to create a safer and better world?
In July, we marked the seventy-fifth anniversary since the Sumner Welles Declaration on the non-recognition policy of the illegal Soviet annexation of the Baltic States. This policy reflected the principle, based on international law, that the change of borders by force is not acceptable. The firm stance of the international
community in support of this principle has been of great importance to us.
Since its completion in San Francisco in 1945, the Charter of the United Nations has embodied the core principles of the international system. However, far too often international order and principles have been violated and the United Nations has been unable to prevent conflicts or build peace or stop atrocities. Past failures must be lessons for the future. The United Nations, and in particular the Security Council, must be able to implement the mission set by the Charter with a renewed sense of responsibility.
It is time to move forward with Security Council reform. We applaud efforts to revive negotiations on this important issue. Latvia supports the expansion of the Security Council in both categories of membership. At least one additional non-permanent seat should be ensured for the Eastern European States. Early action of the United Nations in situations of concern is crucial. Latvia supports the proposal to voluntarily restrain the use of the veto in the Security Council in situations involving mass atrocity crimes. It also supports, for all members of the Council, adherence to a code of conduct that would suspend their right to veto any action designed to end and prevent mass atrocity crimes.
On several crucial occasions in recent times, the Security Council was not able to take timely and decisive action. That has had dire consequences. The Security Council was blocked from playing a role in stopping Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and in seeking justice for the victims of the Flight MH-17 in

an international tribunal that could establish the truth on who shot down that civilian aeroplane. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has cost thousands of lives and led to the suffering of millions of innocent victims. Russia must stop all forms of support to separatists and use its influence to make them adhere to the Minsk agreements. Full implementation of the Minsk agreements by all parties is essential.
The international community, including the General Assembly, supports Ukraine and its territorial integrity. The illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol by Russia will not be recognized. We are particularly concerned about the worsening social, economic and human rights situation in Crimea, especially affecting Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians. Together with the rest of the international community, Latvia will continue to support Ukraine’s reform process in order to strengthen its democracy, economy and good governance.
The horrific conflict in Syria has entered its fifth year. It has created a humanitarian catastrophe and destabilized the whole region. The international community must not abandon the people of Syria and must push for a political settlement. Those responsible for using internationally prohibited chemical weapons in Syria must be identified and held accountable. The conflict and fragility of Syria and Iraq have contributed to the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/ Daesh and the violent extremism spreading globally. Concerted international action is vital to defeat this evil and is key to achieving lasting peace and stability in Syria, Iraq and the wider region.
Latvia welcomes the recent nuclear agreement with Iran. The full and smooth implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan is now necessary. Only then can a change in the regional dynamics towards more engagement and cooperation, as well as greater stability in the Middle East region, become a reality.
It is commendable that, despite all the existing challenges, the Government of Afghanistan has shown its commitment to the democratic process. Sustainable peace and stability in the country can be achieved only with continued strong commitment from the Afghan side and further international support.
The resolution of protracted conflicts in Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno Karabakh should remain on the international agenda.
Increased migration from conflict-torn Middle East and African countries to Europe has become one of the greatest humanitarian challenges of our time. Migration challenges also persist in the Asia-Pacific region and in the Americas. Beyond immediate humanitarian responses, the new trends of migration and forced displacement require long-term, comprehensive solutions. The stabilization of political, economic and social situations in the European Union’s neighbourhoods must be the ultimate goal. At the same time, a greater focus should be put on addressing the root causes of increased illegal migration, including by strengthening conflict prevention capabilities.
Latvia welcomes the ongoing United Nations review of peacekeeping. Cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations is essential to effectively fulfil peacekeeping mandates. Operational tasks need to be effectively synchronized between all involved parties. The European Union is an important partner of the United Nations, as demonstrated in the Central African Republic, Mali and other places. Latvia provides a voluntary contribution to United Nations peacekeeping and intends, for the first time, to participate in a United Nations peacekeeping mission.
International commitment to protect populations from atrocity crimes has been greatly strengthened in the past 10 years. Latvia strongly supports the work of the International Criminal Court as the legal arm of the responsibility to protect and hopes for swift activation of the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute on the crime of aggression.
This year the international community will conclude two of the most important international processes of our times. We have just adopted the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) for the next 15 years. The Sustainable Development Goals must drive us to make real changes to end poverty and build prosperity and equality for all. With well-thought-out, focused and action-oriented policies we can do it. But most importantly, the involvement and accountability of all stakeholders at all levels will be critical to the success of the Sustainable Development Goals.
These Goals will be greatly reinforced by the approval of a new universal agreement to address climate change at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris. Failure to undertake ambitious mitigation actions cannot be accepted. Any
2/33 15-29568

further postponement will make adaptation extremely costly or even unfeasible. Latvia supports the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It is also important to send a strong signal to investors and business of the plans to move towards a low-carbon, climate-resilient world.
The United Nations has played a crucial role in advancing economic and social development and human rights for everyone. These ideals and values have proven to be timeless and universal. The United Nations will continue to be an important forum in the quest for solutions to future challenges through global discussion, raising awareness, creating expertise and building trust. At the forefront of these issues is the speed at which technology is evolving. Technological development is a source of progress and growth. At the same time, the rapid advancement of technology has exposed significant vulnerabilities and a variety of issues of transnational and cross-sectoral nature.
Nations are facing an increasing challenge in countering cyberthreats. Efforts to prevent the misuse of new technologies, either by State or non-State actors, should be cooperative, international and cross- sectoral and involve all stakeholders. This will not be an easy process. We need to safeguard the right balance between fostering freedom of expression and open innovation on the Internet and ensuring that legitimate national security concerns are taken into account. This year, the General Assembly will review the results of the implementation of the World Summit on the Information Society over the past 10 years. It is important that this review process, in which Latvia is playing a leading role, be successful and contribute to the achievement of the overall United Nations goals set forth in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Next year, we shall have to choose the next Secretary-General. It is important that the selection process be transparent and inclusive. Furthermore, it is high time for the Eastern European Group of States to provide the best possible candidate for the post of the next Secretary-General. It is the only regional group that has never been represented in this position.
The people of our nations want to live in a safe, stable and prosperous world where conflicts, hunger and inequalities do not exist. In order to succeed in the task of implementing the new development Agenda, we all have the obligation to work to make the world a better place. Our responsibility is to ensure that the
road ahead is built on the goals that were laid down in the Charter 70 years ago and which remain valid today and in the future.
"
70,2015,CHL,"Today’s world is faced with both challenges and tasks. We are witnessing a plethora of serious international crises in various parts of the world, crises that have impacted international peace and security, most notably in the Middle East, but also in Europe and Africa. Those crises affect, in particular, huge segments of the civilian populations, who, in desperation, are fleeing in order to save their lives and forge a better future.
As an international community, we are dutybound to react with solidarity to restore peace and deploy a response that will enable us to minimize the suffering of both the victims of war and those who are fleeing from war. We commend the efforts that many countries are making to take in the refugees, but we must do more. That is why my Government has decided to take in refugees from the civil war in Syria, and it is also why Chile will expand cooperation with Africa. As of 2016, for example, we will be participating in United Nations peacekeeping operations in that region.
In addition to facint the most urgent challenges threatening peace, our planet has yet to stem growing inequality or reach an agreement that would halt global warming. It is for that reason, against the backdrop of such serious international challenges, that this seventieth session of the General Assembly will go down in history as a momentous occasion on which the international community succeeded in forging an agreement, namely, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). That Agenda is replete with hope and is binding in nature. It focuses on addressing various aspects of inequality, which is the main challenge to be found in Latin America, and of course, it goes without saying, in Chile as well.
In this new phase of our economic and political development the new Agenda is broad and ambitious and is commensurate with the pressing challenges and long-term goals of fair, creative and peaceful human coexistence. It does not sweep aside the commitments that have already been entered into whose fulfilment is still pending, but rather incorporates new goals and targets, integrating them multidimensionally into the concept of sustainable and inclusive development. It is, in other words, an Agenda of change.
That is an approach that we share and vigorously support — equality within and among countries, equality
between men and women, growth, industrialization and inclusive and sustainable consumption, the protection of the environment in its various facets, and social peace, to name but a few of the Agenda’s Goals. They are the face and indeed the foundation of a mode of coexistence based on very deeply held values.
We have an opportunity to address the feelings of despair and hopelessness about the future and the lack of trust in institutions that permeate some of our societies. The chief responsibility for sustainable and more equal development rests with each individual country. Chile is wholeheartedly committed to delivering on that responsibility. However, success in that endeavour requires a propitious environment, since many of the targets are affected by global dynamics and most of the challenges that we face today cannot be resolved by any single country acting in isolation.
Only if we can deliver on an agenda of change at the global as well as the national levels will it be possible to promote more inclusive and sustainable societies. When international trade does not act as an engine of growth, when financial flows are asymmetrical, minimal and volatile, if there are no fair and effective mechanisms for dealing with sovereign debt, if there are not enough predictable flows of official development assistance, then emerging countries, especially the poorer ones, will have great difficulty in attaining the Goals contained in the 2030 Agenda.
Similarly, it is clear that international financial, monetary and trading systems must operate more democratically, effectively and fairly in relation to the interests of developing countries. That is not always the case at present. Consequently, a basic prerequisite for making the Agenda a reality is to strengthen the system of global institutions and multilateral cooperation with broad representation, clear mandates and effective tools. We are calling for an architecture of multilateral institutions that will provide backing for the national policies proposed under the 2030 Agenda.
Chile has strengthened the role it plays in the multilateral system. In 2014 and 2015 we have served as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. In the light of that experience we wish to reaffirm our belief in the need to reform the Council by increasing the number of its permanent members and by reducing the use of the veto, at the very least in cases involving crimes against humanity. Such a reform is necessary, reflecting the considerable change and progress seen
in the multilateral system, and it would undoubtedly confer greater legitimacy on that most important organ of the United Nations.
We as a country are aware that we are all responsible for ensuring that the international system works properly. One essential element for bringing that about is the principle of adherence to international law, which includes strict respect for treaties, as a means of guaranteeing peace and international stability. That requires respecting what has been agreed on and refraining from misusing the mechanisms that have been designed for peacefully resolving any differences that may exist.
From its home at the southern tip of the American continent, Chile is looking forward, full of hope, to the outcome of the 2015 Paris Climate Conference in December. We have one of the longest coastlines in the world. We will soon be hosting the second Our Ocean Conference, at which countries will be asked to make voluntary commitments to reducing pollution of the seas, combat illegal fishing and protect the diversity of marine resources.
As for its intended nationally determined contribution, my country committed to reducing its CO2 emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, compared with 2007, and by up to 45 per cent if we can count on robust international support. Moreover, we are determined to restore 100,000 acres of forest and to reforest an additional 100,000 acres of land.
Agenda 2030 gives us a shared horizon, a shared destination. Now we must act. Each country must act individually, of course, but at the same time we must cooperate with each other in the various North- South and South-South forums and must tackle global challenges jointly in the multilateral forums that we have available to us.
I should like to conclude this statement by congratulating two Governments of our region that have resumed diplomatic relations recently, namely, Cuba and the United States of America. That is an historic step for our region and for the world. Chile applauds the use of dialogue and respect for international law as the civilized way for countries to resolve their differences.
I should also like to say that we are extraordinarily pleased to see that there have been numerous other agreements reached as well, for instance between the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia. We believe that is also proof that where there is a will, there is a way to come to an agreement. Colombia and its people can count on our active support in that process, which we are confident will lead to a lasting peace.
We have reason to be proud of our joint achievements and also, let it be said, to be concerned about and attentive to our collective future. But there are grounds for hope as well. Those beliefs should guide our action and our commitment to build a better world, a world in which there is better balance between development and the preservation of our environment, a world in which we see more justice, cohesion and equality in our societies and among our peoples.

70,2015,SWZ,"It is a great pleasure for me to address the General Assembly of the United Nations as we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of our global Organization. It is important, at this time, that we revisit the founding objectives of the United Nations to determine whether we have been able to live up to what they have required of us since its establishment. Primarily, the United Nations was set up to promote peace and stability among humankind and to assist nations to develop socially and economically, to mention but a few of the founding objectives. This annual session gives us an opportunity to review and recommit ourselves to the objectives laid out by our predecessors.
Tremendous progress has been made on a number of social fronts, while growth in the economies and the development of nations is evident. However, that success has come with its own challenges that need to be addressed in a spirit of global cooperation in order to achieve the ultimate goal of peaceful progress and development that leaves nobody behind. We urge the United Nations to continue to play its role in fostering a collective approach to overcoming all impediments.

The capabilities and successes of the United Nations are well documented. We have seen the United Nations play a significant role in resolving conflicts on the African continent and in other parts of the world. The role of the United Nations in curbing the Ebola outbreak is appreciated. While we have not eradicated the disease completely, we applaud the Organization’s tremendous efforts to stem its spread. We also commend the United Nations for launching such initiatives as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which has played a significant role in combating those diseases. We appeal to the United Nations to continue helping Africa emerge from the cycle of poverty and disease as the continent seeks to fulfil its Agenda 2063, which seeks to eradicate poverty and create prosperity for all.
Africa has great potential for investment. What remains is to create the requisite environment for economic growth. We strongly believe that the United Nations system can establish a peaceful global village free of fear and violence. We adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aiming to emancipate humankind from poverty and hunger by creating prosperity in a safe and peaceful environment that offers acceptable basic living standards (resolution 55/2). We are pleased to observe that our decision has, by and large, yielded positive outcomes that live up to the founding principles of the United Nations.
The impressive progress witnessed during the implementation of the MDGs makes us confident that the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) will enjoy even greater success. We have good reason to anticipate a sustainable transformation of nations over the next 15 years. Our presence here should signify a renewed commitment to our resolve.
The Kingdom of eSwatini is one of many nations to report significant progress in the implementation of the MDGs. That progress has been guided by a people-driven road map leading us towards our Swaziland Vision 2022, which is designed to propel the Kingdom to become a developed country, a development State. We are very much aware of the challenges that lie ahead on the journey, but I have full confidence in the capabilities of our people. They have worked very hard over the years to bring us to where we are today. Although we may not have an abundance of natural resources, we do have an innovative and educated workforce that is united in a common purpose.
With Africa opening up new trade markets and investment opportunities, the Kingdom of eSwatini has fast-tracked reforms that have yielded improved ease of doing business. Infrastructure development has also improved direct access to global markets through the completion of our new international airport, while providing multiple investment opportunities in its immediate surroundings. We believe that the airport will give rise to downstream projects that can create employment opportunities and add the required impetus to our economic growth.
Access to markets of the developed world remains critical for Africa, which is well endowed with mineral resources yet still faces the challenges of poverty, hunger and unemployment. The support of the United Nations is essential if we are to successfully deal with the mammoth task of developing infrastructure so that we can add value to our natural resources. The success of trade and investment also hinges heavily on a reliable and sustainable supply of energy. As a result, we now have a comprehensive strategy and programme of action that outline the gaps that need to be addressed by all players in the energy sector. They present viable opportunities for investment in that sector, particularly in renewable energy.
As we envisage a world free of poverty, hunger, disease and want, where all life can thrive, it becomes critical to make youth empowerment central to achieving that goal. Attaining a 97 per cent enrolment rate in primary education is a significant milestone for our country as we seek to ensure education for all. Sustainable education requires that that high enrolment should be complemented by quality education that is further accessible at the secondary, higher and tertiary levels.
We remain challenged in meeting that requirement, and we call upon our global friends to partner with us to ensure that we do not become victims of our own success. We are recognizing and rewarding outstanding educational talent through entrepreneurial development initiatives at the secondary and tertiary levels. We trust that those initiatives, among many others, will produce a future generation that is equipped with the life skills needed to provide solutions to the socioeconomic challenges facing many of our unemployed youth today. The Kingdom is also developing innovation parks that will provide our young people with the creative skills needed to enable them to contribute to the sustainable development of the country.

The HIV/AIDS pandemic, which has stretched our health resources to the limit, remains a challenge that requires our collective effort. As a nation, we have taken a decision that we want to become one of the first African countries with a generalized epidemic to achieve an AIDS-free generation in 2022 — a vision that is in line with the global agenda to end AIDS by 2030.
The Kingdom of eSwatini still largely relies on agriculture as a means to sustain itself and prosper. Programmes aimed at increasing food production, ending hunger and improving nutrition have been developed. A farm input-subsidy programme aimed at increasing yields through the availability of tractors, seeds and fertilizer is now in place. The country has also invested heavily in building dams to harness water, and we hope that friends of the Kingdom will continue to partner with us in building more such facilities. The dams are helping many of our people to irrigate their crops. We look to international financial institutions to support those initiatives. We are concerned, however, that some of that support attaches stringent conditions with consequences that leave the recipient countries worse off. We therefore appeal to the United Nations to address that phenomenon, which seriously undermines the objectives of the 2030 Agenda.
We are very aware that, working alone, we are limited in our success. It is, therefore, important that the developed countries of the world support the growth of developing nations like ours. We appeal to donor countries to increase their funding to smaller nations so that they can strengthen their capacity to create jobs and address existing social challenges. Only when our communities achieve better living conditions will developing countries enjoy the peace and stability that provides the requisite environment for sustainable growth.
The effects of climate change have not gone unnoticed, nor have they left us unharmed. Sustainable Development Goal 11 calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. We continue to urge our developed partners not only to fulfil their pledges to the Green Fund but also to adopt policies that strike the correct balance among the requirements for the production of essential products, profits and the sustainability of our environment. Anything less would seriously jeopardize the ideals of the 2030 Agenda. We look forward to a legally binding global climate
agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in France later this year.
The Kingdom of eSwatini continues to enjoy the peace and stability that all people on the globe deserve. The secret to our success has been consultation and dialogue aimed at building consensus, which is a model of peace that has a place in the implementation of United Nations operations. It is apparent that military intervention in resolving conflict has a short-term effect that leaves the people that it is meant to serve worse off. Only a peaceful solution to conflict can yield sustainable conclusions to the current crises facing various parts of the world today. That calls for us to unite and to bring the warring parties to the table for dialogue.
However, for that to be truly effective, we need the United Nations to ensure that any intervention is undertaken by a united body. If the United Nations is divided on the mandates that it creates to deal with challenges that require a collective approach, it runs the risk of worsening the problems. It is critical that, when the Members of the United Nations are confronted with conflict situations, they resolve them with one voice.
The protracted war in Syria remains a huge challenge for the United Nations. One of its consequences has been the serious refugee crisis that we have today, affecting neighbouring countries and, most recently, various European States. We applaud all the countries that have accepted the refugees and provided them with food and shelter, and we appeal to the Syrian people to come together to find a peaceful and lasting solution to their differences. There can be only one solution to that predicament, which is to resolve the source of the conflict so that all of the people of Syria are able to benefit from the peace they deserve. It is imperative that the objectives of the United Nations be met. One important aim of the United Nations is to work to rid society of all hostilities. We have put conflict-resolution mechanisms in place, and it is our duty to ensure that they are implemented effectively.
We trust that, as we proceed with the 2030 Agenda, we will fully embrace an all-inclusive approach. We therefore urge the United Nations to give every country in the world the opportunity to contribute to the global community in whatever form and capacity it can. In that regard, we appeal to the United Nations to consider admitting the Republic of China on Taiwan to membership. Like every other country, it has the
15-29431 21/51

A/70/PV.16 29/09/2015
potential to contribute positively to the global agenda, in its case in such areas as health care and information and communications technology, to mention only a few.
The inclusiveness espoused by the United Nations should encompass representation in the key bodies of the Organization. The African continent continues to appeal for a permanent seat on the Security Council through which its voice will be fully represented, as outlined in the Ezulwini Consensus. We trust that the matter will receive the attention it deserves.
Finally, I would like once again to extend my heartiest congratulations to the entire United Nations family for its attainment of 70 years of togetherness. We wish to commend all United Nations agencies for their sustained efforts to fulfil the ideals of the Organization, which have benefited humankind in many ways. Let us renew our commitment to the objectives of our global Organization. We have grown in numbers, and that has given rise to new paradigms. We are certain that, with the correct mindset, that will be addressed accordingly. However, it is important to realize that, as much as our goals may be universal, we do not share the same capabilities and capacities for implementing them. May Almighty God bless us all.
"
70,2015,HTI,"Mr. President, I would like to express my warmest congratulations to you on your election as President of our prestigious Assembly at its seventieth session. Your proven experience in international affairs, combined with your esteemed personal qualities, bode well for the success of this session of the General Assembly.
In this pivotal year, when the Organization is celebrating its seventieth anniversary, I would like to commend the efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and associate myself with the unanimous tributes paid to him for his commitment to promoting peace and sustainable development and to the fight against climate change. The people and the
Government of Haiti are particularly grateful for the spirit of solidarity that he has always shown with regard to our country in its ongoing struggle to strengthen our democracy.
In a world where, in the words of His Holiness Pope Francis, speaking at the World Meeting of Popular Movements, “global interdependence calls for global answers to local problems”, the challenge to the United Nations today is to reinvent itself, to reform itself and, above all, to be the bearer of a new vision of our shared future, a vision capable of reviving the original flame and of reuniting Member States around a grand collective plan focused on the bedrock of core values on which the Organization is built.
In that respect, we welcome a number of recent diplomatic breakthroughs that bring glimmers of hope in international relations. The restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States of America and Cuba is undoubtedly a historic breakthrough. It allows us to anticipate greater serenity in hemispheric relations. The Republic of Haiti can only rejoice at that development. We pay tribute to the vision, pragmatism and leadership shown by the American and Cuban Heads of State, who opened a new chapter in the relations between the two countries.
Similarly, we welcome the signing of the agreement between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the group of six countries on the Iranian nuclear issue and the détente that has resulted from it. I also welcome the atmosphere of cordiality and fraternal dialogue that now governs the relations between the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. We have no doubt that the new momentum in their relations will significantly contribute to a much- hoped-for thaw among all the countries of South-East Asia, moving beyond their differences and divergences. The Republic of Haiti encourages the spirit of dialogue prevailing in the relations between nations, which seeks to reach peaceful solutions to their conflicts.
The Syrian crisis is a real affront to the conscience of humankind. Non-State entities are expanding their grip every day, particularly in Iraq and Syria, engaging in intolerable atrocities against civilian populations and in the destruction of world cultural-heritage sites. Such threats, which are of an exceptional scale and gravity, pose a challenge to the international community. We have a clear obligation to adopt all collective measures necessary so as to ensure international security and respect for human rights. We must redouble our efforts to oppose with determination the barbarism of terrorist
4/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
entities and their criminal acts that endanger our shared values. There can be no real peace or security if the international community shows weakness towards those who violate international public order.
It goes without saying that we cannot hope for effective responses to the global challenges of our time without narrowing the North-South divide, without an intensification of the fight against poverty, and without a proactive response to environmental crises that afflict, above all, the poorest countries. Strengthening the credibility of the United Nations means strengthening its ability to act quickly and intervene effectively in maintaining peace and security, especially when it comes to preventing major crisis situations, calming recurring sources of tension or resolving conflicts that have gone on for too long.
I would like to discuss the situation of my country, the Republic of Haiti. On 9 August, an important stage in the consolidation of democracy in Haiti was reached. An independent electoral council, chosen by civil society, launched the electoral process that will lead to presidential, legislative, municipal and territorial elections before the end of this year.
A year ago, in his report to the Security Council on the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), the Secretary-General noted that holding inclusive elections was
“essential for ... the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law and to promote socioeconomic development, which is necessary to improve the living conditions of the population and achieve enduring stability” (S/2014/617, para. 62).
I am pleased to confirm to the General Assembly that my country is on track. The Haitian people has demonstrated political maturity and the ability to take control of its destiny. I wish to express my deep gratitude to all of Haiti’s cooperation partners and to the United Nations for the scale of the support provided in the preparation and holding of the electoral contests. The success of the elections will be an important milestone on the country’s road to stability and in the political transition in 2016. That will be a key indicator of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti’s sound performance and success over the past 11 years.
Significant progress has been made in Haiti, especially during the past four years. I can say that, under my Administration, democracy was
consolidated, institutions guaranteeing the rule of law were strengthened, the situation in terms of the security environment has improved significantly, and human rights have been promoted and respected. Never has the number of international conventions ratified by the country — on the protection of human rights, the rights of children, women and vulnerable people — been more substantial. At the same time, extreme poverty has declined, foreign direct investment has shown a net expansion, and, after decades of stagnation, the economy has returned to growth.
In terms of the Millennium Development Goals, much progress has been reported. Haiti has reached the target for the reduction in the prevalence of underweight children under 5 years of age, three years ahead of schedule. Thanks to the universal education enrolment programme, which is compulsory and free and was set up by my Administration, more than 1 million children have been able to attend school. We have also seen progress in access to safe drinking water, lower infant- mortality rates, the alleviation of extreme poverty and the fight against social exclusion. In the field of public health, we have achieved undeniable success in the fight against HIV/AIDS and malaria.
The progress made in recent years was made possible thanks, in part, to the support of MINUSTAH. Those achievements represent an outstanding contribution to the country’s stability, without which there can be no serious possibility of economic modernization and sustainable development. MINUSTAH is in the process of adapting to a new environment, different from that prevailing when it was established. The Haitian Government prefers a reconfiguration plan that takes into account the evolving situation on the ground. I reiterate our desire to see the gradual, orderly withdrawal of the Mission’s troops. The withdrawal of troops and the transfer of responsibilities to the Haitian authorities in matters of the military, police and development must be made according to an agreed calendar, thereby avoiding any undermining of the country’s internal or external security.
Defence and security issues are of primary importance for my Administration. I have strengthened the National Police and have developed a new defence policy, with support from the Inter-American Defence Board, through the adoption of a white paper calling for the creation of a defence force in the country. The new force will participate actively in Haiti’s development, with a focus on environmental protection, rescue efforts
15-29658 5/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
in cases of natural disaster, securing our borders and strengthening the protection of investments.
As the end of my term approaches, I am pleased and proud to have worked and will continue to work towards my country’s stability and strengthened democracy, thereby honouring my solemn commitments to the Haitian people, as well as to the international community. I am especially grateful to the various United Nations bodies that have stood by us throughout.
Haiti reaffirms its faith in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Organization’s efforts to promote peacebuilding and strengthen international solidarity. The elimination of extreme poverty is not beyond our reach; it is everyone’s business. In that regard, the Republic of Haiti fully supports the new Sustainable Development Goals, established pursuant to the new post-2015 development agenda in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and looks forward to their swift and effective implementation, together with the appropriate resources.
At the time of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, the spirit that presided over its creation is more than ever alive. Faced with unprecedented global challenges, including the growing threat of global warming, Member States must ensure that the Organization works to build the impetus needed to strengthen it as a space for collaboration. A new dynamic is necessary in matters of peace and development, under which every State agrees that the use of force must be subject to law, where dialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes emerge as the cornerstone of inter-State relations and where the
“recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world”,
as stated in resolution 217 A (III), of 10 December 1948, by which the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
"
70,2015,PRY,"Seventy years ago, on the still smoking ruins of the Second World War, the United Nations was born, with the purpose of maintaining international peace and security and promoting cooperation among all the nations of the world. The Republic of Paraguay was one of the 51 States that signed the Charter of the United Nations, which has become a historic contribution to the international community. For Paraguay, the right to equality and respect for sovereignty among States, both large and small, justifies the reasonable hope for the full strengthening of the United Nations.
I express my best wishes to the President of the General Assembly for the successful conduct of proceedings at the current session. I would also like to express my singular appreciation for the work of Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whom we had the honour to receive in my country in February. His visit further strengthened our connections with, and commitment to, the Organization and multilateralism. I take this opportunity to reiterate to the Secretary-General my gratitude for recognizing the work and results of our Government’s fight against poverty and expressing his appreciation of the abundant clean and renewable energy that Paraguay is blessed with.
The strengthening of the Organization should have as its specific goal the building of a truly fair and caring world in which human dignity is universal. That means rectifying the inequities and inequalities that still cast a shadow on the world order, a feat whose realization will depend on the extent to which international law is complied with and the dream of a peaceful era and well-being shared among all our nations is fulfilled.
With regard to Paraguay, the main objective of our Government is to reduce poverty in the short term in the context of a State policy aimed at its eradication. To that end, we are maintaining and increasing the scope of our social programmes, especially those focusing on extreme poverty and providing conditions-based assistance. We rely on an arsenal of programmes that provide opportunities, employment and decent housing and ensure respect, equity and access to education, health and high-quality utilities as we wage our unceasing battle to eradicate extreme poverty in our country. These programmes provide comprehensive and permanent solutions that enable people to become independent agents and develop their full potential.
We seek inclusive economic growth for our country, so that progress reaches all Paraguayans.
We are encouraged by the fact that Paraguay is one of the countries with the highest economic growth rates in the region. That has been achieved by maintaining strict fiscal discipline and by improving our production capacity and competitiveness. To the added value of our raw materials, which requires domestic and international investments, we are exponentially adding that of the construction industry, which is rapidly changing the profile of our cities. Similarly, we aim to expand and modernize our infrastructure in the conviction that by transforming the country, we are reducing poverty.
We consistently uphold the importance of young people. Paraguay is a young country; 75 per cent of its population is below 40 years old. That represents a great deal of human capital. I welcome the enthusiasm of young people, in particular Paraguayan students, who in recent days made a united appeal for transparency in public administration and for quality education in Paraguay. We have confidence in the immense potential of our youth, and we firmly believe in the importance of access to high-quality education if we are to achieve the full progress of our nation. That is why we created a scholarship programme, the first phase of which will allow 1,500 Paraguayan professionals to complete master’s degrees and doctorates in the best universities around the world.
On 17 September, our Government, which is committed to transparency and to fighting corruption and its corrosive effects on the foundations of society, enacted the instrument regulating the law on free access to public information and government transparency, which allows all citizens to exercise their constitutional right to be informed. We are promoting a culture of transparency and, from the beginning of our term of office, we have affirmed that what is public should be in the public domain.
Those national efforts will not be enough without international policies that promote effective cooperation, fair-minded exchanges and adequate complementarity among countries and regions. That triad — cooperation, exchange and complementarity — urgently requires a new paradigm, which the United Nations should help in creating. We are living in the age of globalization. A few keystrokes and, thanks to technology, the whole world is within range. Almost instantly, we are aware of what is happening halfway across the world. Moreover, technology affects us directly and personally. We live connected.
Within that context, how does one board the development train? The twenty-first century society requires a key asset: human skills. The new challenges are meant for qualified individuals, and they are such that fitness for survival is in direct proportion to the degree of one’s real and effective academic training. Following the political and industrial revolutions and, together with globalization, the knowledge revolution has taken place. This means that the human element remains the most important and essential resource, provided that people are sufficiently trained. Education is the key. Therefore, it is imperative that UNESCO be strengthened. Developed countries should be driven by a sense of fairness and moral obligation to increase their contributions to its financing. An excellent education and scientific research should not be the preserve of some countries, but rather should be a universal public good.
We witness with great concern today a huge and endless exodus of families fleeing conflicts. I am referring to our brothers in Syria and in other countries faced with the violence of radical and intolerant groups. We cannot turn our backs on this current human tragedy. We call on the Organization to appeal to Member States, in particular the States in the affected region, to adopt the necessary measures in favour of this extremely vulnerable sector of civil society.
Paraguay reaffirms that disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control are essential factors for international peace and security and provide the guarantee that the most vulnerable countries need in order to ensure sustainable economic and social development.
We thank the member States of the International Atomic Energy Agency for the confidence they have shown in Paraguay by unanimously electing it to the Board of Governors. As a Governor, we will act with absolute impartiality and balance in promoting and ensuring the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Another major issue of concern is the preservation of the environment. Paraguay, like many developing countries, gives priority in its national policies to the preservation of the integrity and diversity of the natural legacy bequeathed to us by our ancestors. We are aware of the immense responsibility incumbent upon humankind to safeguard the resources on which its existence depends. It is with this awareness and commitment that Paraguay encourages the rational management of natural resources and promotes the use
of renewable sources of clean energy, in harmony with nature and in pursuit of development.
The whole world heard the urgent call of His Holiness Pope Francis, which was repeated last Friday in the Assembly (see A/70/PV.3). He appealed to us to protect our common home, to engage in urgent discussions on how we intend to build the future of the planet and to unite the whole human family in pursuit of sustainable and comprehensive development. In a masterly fashion, the Holy Father described climate change as a global issue with major environmental, social, economic, distributional and political dimensions, characterizing it as a current challenge for humankind and one whose worst impacts would probably be felt in the developing countries over the coming decades. He went on to say that environmental and social deterioration had the greatest impact on the weakest of the planet, and that this inequity affects entire countries as well as individuals, requiring us to think about the issue of ethics in international relations. In preparation for the next session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, scheduled for later this year in Paris, we must redouble our efforts with a view to making serious political commitments to mitigating, alleviating and reversing the devastating consequences of climate change.
Being a landlocked developing country, as Paraguay is, has some adverse effects. To address that situation, we are proposing, together with 32 other landlocked developing countries, that the more developed economies accord us special and differential treatment, including the removal of high tariffs and non-tariff barriers, thereby enabling us to be more competitive.
True integration also entails the transfer of knowledge and capital investment and a balance in terms of trade and bilateral and multilateral treaties. The reduction of asymmetries depends on economic, social and cultural integration, with a view to a common destiny, not on draconian policies in which weaker countries have to bear the brunt of the burden.
Democracy is a political system in expansion, and it is based on the indivisible principles of equality, freedom and sovereignty. If we want democracy to prevail in our own countries, it is only to be expected that we would also want to prevail at the United Nations. We must aim at ensuring that democracy, equity and geographical representation prevail in its various organs. To that end, Paraguay supports
a reform of the Organization that would strengthen the General Assembly, the most representative organ within the Organization, and restore to it its legitimate powers, which must be interdependent with those of the Security Council, in accordance with the terms of the 1945 Charter.
Paraguay is following with great interest developments with regard to the reform and expansion of the Security Council. We believe that it is necessary to improve the Council’s working methods and to make its management more transparent, and that the views and ideas of non-members of the Council on issues related to international peace and security that will undoubtedly have an impact on them should be heard.
Paraguay welcomes the efforts undertaken by the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan to reduce tension across the Taiwan Strait, efforts which have contributed greatly to ensuring peace and stability in East Asia. Our Government advocates continuing the pragmatic dialogue and mutually beneficial interaction between both sides of the Strait, parties that are also recognized by the international community.
Similarly, Paraguay reaffirms its commitment to supporting the peace process in the sister Republic of Colombia, initiated by President Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, and hopes that the conflict, which has claimed thousands of innocent lives, will soon be resolved.
We welcome the agreement reached on 23 September in Havana. It signals an important step towards achieving the long-awaited peace in that sisterly nation, which is linked to my country by honourable historical traditions.
The promotion of human rights is a priority issue if we are to move towards a more balanced, fair and dignified world. For us, the rights to freedom, free assembly, human integrity and quality of life are essential. So long as there is discrimination, whether it be racial, religious, political or gender-based, our human rights record will be deficient. It is in the light of this vision that Paraguay is becoming a first-time member of the Human Rights Council, where it is to be one of the Vice-Presidents. Owing to the social dimension that we give to these inalienable rights, we also aspire to join the Economic and Social Council for the period 2019-2021.
Paraguay, with its preponderance of young people, is inspired to vigorously promote their active
participation in building a more just and free society and the protection of the rights of children and women.
Fate has given us the huge responsibility of governing and representing our nations at a time when international solidarity has become imperative. Paraguay brings from the beating heart of America its continued and caring commitment to the beautiful 70-year-old dream of strengthening peace and security in the world. Today’s reality also calls upon us, more than ever before, to protect our common home — our damaged and mistreated planet. Let us fully meet this challenge so that we can bequeath to future generations a world at peace that is fairer, healthier and more inclusive and is a better place to live.
May God bless us all.
"
70,2015,IRQ,"The seventieth session of the General Assembly is being held amidst the grave challenges the world is facing on more than one level, especially in fighting terrorism, foremost among which is the terrorism of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). We in Iraq stand steadfastly and patiently with the world to ward off the monstrosity of those whose actions affect our country, the region and the world. This is happening, while international efforts continue to strengthen the pillars of peace and security, promote communication among the peoples of the world and attain human development. These efforts are all made under the auspices of the United Nations, which has worked tirelessly to uphold its major pillars of health care, education and raising living standards.
Since the United Nations Development Programme launched its first Human Development Report in 1990, the countries of the world, including Iraq, have anticipated improvements in their human development levels. We have pursued this goal so that people would become the means and targets of the development process. As a result of the flawed policies of the past dictatorial regime of Saddam Al-Hussein, the standard of human development fell after a series of wars that were fought by that regime and the deprivations and siege that Iraq suffered as a result of international sanctions.
The situation improved after the political regime changed and once a democratic atmosphere was promoted, particularly with the assistance provided by the United Nations, its specialized agencies and other international organizations. Our national institutions tried to bridge the development gap in fulfilment of the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) adopted by the leaders of the world at the General Assembly in 2000 by concentrating on targets that were supposed to have been achieved by 2015.
We in Iraq made tangible progress in decreasing mortality rates, increasing school enrolment, reducing gender inequality and improving living standards. However the ill-will of terrorist groups, foremost among which are Al-Qaida and ISIS, as well as those associated with the old Ba’ath regime who joined them,
obstructed our development process and spread death and destruction on our people and infrastructure. In persisting in their atrocities, those terrorists did not distinguish between an infant and an elderly person, or between a man and a woman. These evil forces terrorized civilians throughout Iraq and pursued a policy of ethnic cleansing, particularly in those areas that they claimed to support. Many people who once lived in the western and northern parts of Iraq are today refugees or displaced internally by these merciless gangsters. They are suffering with those who are still besieged in their villages and cities.
While we highly appreciate the support and solidarity extended to us by the United Nations and the international community in our just war against terrorism, we also recognize the tireless efforts made to restore stability to the regions that have been liberated by our armed forces, the popular mobilization forces and the tribal fighters. We also look forward to an effective contribution on the part of countries and international organizations to repairing our infrastructure and helping our reconstruction efforts.
Despite all this, Iraq is pursuing its democratic policies to promote respect for the Constitution, the peaceful transition of power, freedom of expression, and the elimination of racial ethnic and sectarian discrimination. Despite the challenges, we are aware of public demands and have worked to establish an organizational framework known as the Popular Mobilization Committee, which receives its instructions from the President of the Republic and the armed forces. Thus, the popular mobilization forces operate within the law as they fight terrorists and organized crime, particularly those who carry arms outside the framework of the State. The Iraqi Constitution bans carrying arms outside the legal framework of the State.
The Iraqi security forces protect demonstrators and give them full freedom to express their demands. While we may be in a state of war, many governorates have peaceful demonstrations and there are excellent relations between the demonstrators and the security forces. This is a unique experience indeed. I personally decided to entrust a working task force to follow up the demands of the demonstrators so that we can assist in implementing these demands.
The Iraqi Council of Representatives has enacted the Government’s programme of work. The Council represents the Iraqi people. We have adopted a
progressive vision of reform, sanctioned by the highest religious authority. We have listened to the demands that our people expressed over the past two months. We have therefore provided economic, administrative and financial reform packages. We have started working to invigorate the private sector in our country. We have provided financing for small and medium-sized projects, despite the difficulties we experienced after the huge drop in oil revenues, which account for 92 per cent of our income. The reform package was respectfully accepted by our people, who expressed their views in detail. The reform enjoys the support of the highest religious authorities and other stakeholders in society. We are determined to pursue our reform without disregarding our important role in directing the security and military effort to fight ISIS.
On behalf of the Iraqi people, I should like to salute the efforts of the brotherly and friendly countries in the international coalition in our war against terror. Providing more support is very important because it is the Iraqis who are fighting this war. We therefore thank the brotherly countries that have provided assistance, but would request further assistance to address the problems of refugees. Increased logistical and military support would bring us closer to our ultimate victory and promote peace and security in all countries of the world.
Iraq understood the importance of international efforts to draft a new development document to be adopted by the United Nations after the Millennium Declaration. Iraqi experts and national institutions participated in the international efforts made in our region to draft the new Declaration adopted in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). The importance of the Declaration is not limited to the pursuit of development for the human individual. It focuses on sustainability, which includes advocating a clean environment, the preservation of the rights of future generations, the promotion of peace and security, the elimination of poverty and discrimination, improving the health and educational standards of children and achieving wider freedoms, living in peace and bridging the gap between the poor and the rich. These are only some of the reforms that we are trying to attain in Iraq today by bridging these gaps and by redressing the injustice experienced by many sectors in our society and the world.
The important items included in the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals and their achievement
by 2030 require us all to work more tirelessly to achieve further cooperation among the peoples and countries of the world, instead of fighting each other. That would provide the United Nations with sufficient opportunity to work constructively in order to expedite the achievement of these objectives and share its expertise through programmes to be undertaken throughout the world. Iraq will earnestly and enthusiastically work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals within the time frame assigned. We know that this development will affect not just Iraq alone but all countries, because no country can achieve sustainable development unless it is enjoyed by neighbouring countries as well.
Iraq expects all countries of the world to implement Security Council resolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014) and 2199 (2015), which call for ending all support, financing and arming to terrorist groups. I also cite General Assembly resolution 69/281, adopted on 25 May 2015 to salvage the cultural heritage of Iraq, the implementation of which would allow Iraq to rebuild its country and achieve development.
The Government and people of Iraq understand the importance of communicating with the peoples and Governments of the world. We are eager to build peace and understanding in our region, and therefore we seek to open prospects for new relations with the countries of the region and to promote such relations without interfering in the internal affairs of others so as to guarantee a bright future for us all.
The political process in Iraq is democratic and governed by the peaceful turnover of power. Five Governments have succeeded each other in Iraq; our Government is the latest of these and therefore takes pride in our democratic processes. However, there are political blocs that have different points of view. We are proud of the fact that others have the right to express their opinions, which shows that there is a political sphere for the free expression of opinion.
Our problem in Iraq is not an internal one. Our problem is that a terrorist group has crossed our border from a neighbouring country. That organization is supported and armed by others, has occupied vast areas of Iraq and killed thousands of Iraqis and violated their rights. ISIS continues to recruit thousands of volunteers from throughout the world, but particularly from countries that have stressed their solidarity with Iraq. This terrorist organization receives assistance and weapons and continues to fight us, so our problem is
6/28 15-29701

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21
really an external one, embodied in the support enjoyed by such terrorist organizations.
While the popular mobilization forces in Iraq are a legitimate organization that is supported by the Iraqi State, ISIS and associated entities are illegitimate terrorist groups that do not respect the State or the law and kill anyone who happens to think differently. Even those who happen to confess the same faith have been killed and displaced by ISIS. More than 3 million people have been displaced by ISIS from the cities they once called home. We are eager to build relations with our neighbouring countries. We respect their sovereignty and do not interfere in their internal affairs. We therefore call on them to promote the same quality of relationship. We want them not to interfere in our affairs and to respect Iraqi sovereignty and our right to uphold the sanctity of Iraqi lives.
In conclusion, I thank the United Nations and other international organizations for supporting Iraq’s efforts to achieve development, and salute the efforts of international organizations and all other world leaders and their representatives. It is truly my hope that next year we will meet in better circumstances. I urge all countries of the region to work together to achieve peace instead of killing and destruction. We believe that each and every leader of the region must assume responsibility to stop the bloodshed. The leaders of the region have a responsibility to end this killing, which is an evil visited on humanity at large.
"
70,2015,LBR,"On this auspicious occasion, the seventieth anniversary of the United
Nations, I am honoured to address the Assembly on behalf of the Government and people of Liberia. I congratulate the President on his election to preside over the Assembly, and I appreciate the stewardship of his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, who ably conducted the Assembly’s affairs at the sixty-ninth session.
This year has registered ground-breaking developments. After 50 years, the United States and Cuba have decided to resolve differences by establishing diplomatic relations. Another milestone was the adoption here, a few days ago, of the post-2015 development agenda, “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (resolution 70/1), by which we committed to implementing measures to transform the lives of our peoples — to lift them from poverty to prosperity — and to preserve the planet. It was this same vision that, 70 years ago, motivated the founding of this global organization to promote peaceful coexistence, economic and social advancement of all peoples, respect for human dignity, and equal rights of men and women and nations large and small. I am proud to say that Liberia was among the founding Members of the United Nations.
The creation of the United Nations came out of a realization that only a global organization, through the support and cooperation of the comity of nations, would be suitable to grapple with the many challenges facing humankind. Today, a reduction in inter-State conflict and cooperation in the protection and promotion of human rights and in alleviating global poverty, disease and hunger are the hallmarks of this body. On the other hand, increased intra-State conflicts and international terrorism are seeking to undermine the gains made in reducing human suffering. Protracted and intense conflicts in various parts of the world pose serious threats to global peace and security.
Thus new and emerging challenges call the United Nations to action. Despite commendable efforts, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Europe still have vortexes of conflict. Migrants and people seeking refuge from conflicts and economic hardship are swirling across Europe. We are haunted by the growing threats of destabilizing forces, such as Boko Haram and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS), and by attempts to reverse democratic initiatives, such as that in Burkina Faso, which invoked an immediate and decisive response from the Economic Community of West African States.

Climate conditions are changing, and so must we. In many countries of the world, women are still being treated as second-class citizens. As Liberia bears painful witness, weak public-health systems in individual countries threaten global health and well- being. It is not beyond this body to find answers and to respond, and we know that we must. We feel compelled to ask if, at 70, our world Organization is hindered today by inflexible structures and overburdened by bureaucracies. Is the current structure of the United Nations fit for purpose — to play its role in the global transformation processes over the next 15 years? We are encouraged by the introspection that is taking place at the United Nations around these questions.
We commend the foresight of the Secretary- General in directing a comprehensive review of peace operations, which is complemented by a review of the Organization’s peacebuilding architecture and a global study on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women’s participation in peace processes. After the completion of these reviews, we expect implementation to bring further improvements. Liberia can attest, with gratitude, to the nature of United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding functions, which are critical and indispensable for post-conflict countries.
This year, we marked the twentieth anniversary of the historic Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, and its Platform for Action for women’s empowerment and gender equality. We are also marking the fifteenth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000), on women’s participation in peace processes. And while improvements have been made in the status of women, much more remains to be done. We must therefore all step up and take further measures, going beyond moralizing gender equality to tangible actions. In 70 years only three women have served as President of the General Assembly — one of them, many years ago, being our compatriot, Mrs. Angie Brooks Randolph. Only a few women have served or are serving as special representative of the Secretary-General, and not a single woman has ever served as Secretary-General.
As we ponder, in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the three countries worst hit by the deadly Ebola virus disease, we bear witness to the foundational creed of the United Nations that we can always find it within our humanity to respond even to unknown enemies to our collective progress. Accordingly, we remain grateful to the international community for the outpouring of
support and assistance as we faced down the deadly disease, the greatest modern threat to global public health. We thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who — in partnership with our countries and with support from the African Development Bank, the African Union, the European Union and the World Bank — hosted the International Ebola Recovery Conference to focus attention on, and seek support for, our post-Ebola recovery programmes.
The Ebola scourge undoubtedly leaves indelible marks of grief, sorrow and unimaginable affliction. But it has also caused us to celebrate heartwarming tales of extraordinary courage and leadership across Governments and communities, as well as exceptional regional and international responses. We are now proceeding with implementation of our post-Ebola economic stabilization and recovery plan, with expectations of support from our bilateral and multilateral partners for a regionally approved post- Ebola recovery strategy that the three Mano River Union countries affected have formulated.
We are determined to address our development losses, including by rebuilding better and more resilient health and education systems. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda, adopted in April, offers pathways to various forms of financing, capacity-building and technological exchange in support of our pursuit of our development objectives. We must now forge genuine partnerships in order to move ahead on the road to strengthening peace and security, human rights, socioeconomic development and environmental sustainability. We stand firm in our political will to meet any challenge to our commitment to leaving no one behind.
"
70,2015,YEM,"On behalf of the people and the Government of Yemen, I would like to congratulate the President most warmly on presiding over the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I wish him every success.
I have come today from the brave and strategic city of Aden, which is experiencing great joy because it has been liberated from the Houthi militia and former President Saleh. Yet I am troubled to see the degree of damage that was left in the wake of those criminal militias, including the destruction of the city and the violence against its civilians. The tragedy is continuing in the cities of Taiz and Marib. It beggars the imagination to think that the number of martyrs just in Aden alone has reached 1,350, while the number of injured has reached 11,160. One can only imagine what the numbers are in Taiz, Marib, Al-Baydhah, Abyan and other Yemeni cities.
Three years ago, I addressed the Assembly and spoke of the different measures that we had undertaken in our country in order to ensure a successful political transition of power in a spirit of peace and in compliance with the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council and its implementation mechanism and pursuant to relevant resolutions of the Security Council (see A/67/PV.9). I said then that Iran was hampering that process. It was training Houthi militias and providing them with weapons, delivered by boat or by other vessels, in order to impose the Iranian model in Yemen.
Between that time three years ago and today, we have worked tirelessly on a peaceful political transition aimed at preparing the broad, year-long national dialogue, bringing together all the political forces of Yemen and setting an honourable precedent
24/26 15-29437

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17
in our country and the region. That was followed by a transparent process for drafting a secular, democratic modern constitution. The Assembly followed the political time lines and dates as they arose and provided direct support. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also provided direct support and visited our country. All elements of Yemeni society, including the Houthis, were part of the process. In addition, there have been visits by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General and the Security Council, as well as the adoption of relevant Security Council resolutions and presidential statements.
Despite all that, as the political transition process was drawing to a close and just when the constitution was supposed to be submitted to a popular referendum, the Houthis and Saleh staged a military and political coup d’état, occupying the capital, Sana’a, and wreaking havoc on hospitals, mosques, Quranic schools, homes and residences. Every form of weaponry was used, including arms from the Yemeni army. The tragedies in Aden, Taiz and Ad Dali could be characterized as genocide. Indeed, it was a desperate attempt to impose the Iranian model through the use of force. Political leaders and thousands of citizens either disappeared or were killed. The media were also affected. Thousands of children were forcibly conscripted, anti-personnel mines were planted and schools, public buildings and homes were converted into weapons storage facilities and barracks. Houthi militia threatened to spread to neighbouring countries, thereby endangering regional and international peace and security.
We attempted to have a dialogue with Saleh and the Houthis, giving them immunity and every opportunity and including them in national dialogue, but they retained their weapons and refused to create a political party in accordance with established law. That was all accepted despite the events that took place in 2004. Saleh’s fight has never been a peaceful one, as was, for example, the peaceful southern movement, in Sa’dah province, which saw its citizens expelled. The Houthis seized military areas and took control by force. Despite our positive approach to that armed movement and various understandings with the Houthi movement, agreements were repeatedly cast aside and a coup d’état was carried out against the State, and people were maltreated and severely punished.
The actions of the Houthi militias, as well as those of Saleh, led us to appeal to neighbouring countries in the Gulf under Article 51 of the Charter of the United
Nations. We appealed for assistance in tackling the Houthi militias that were undermining and threatening national legitimacy. The response was courageous. Our brother His Majesty Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, acted with utter determination. On behalf of the Yemeni people, I would like to convey our sincere thanks to His Majesty King Salman and to all members of the coalition who are pursuing efforts to assist the Yemeni people. We are joined together in blood in this battle for our country and for the legitimacy of the State in order to prevent the country from falling into the hands of Iran, which would like to see the destruction of the country and to control the Bab al-Mandab strait.
The Yemeni people have opposed attempts by the Houthis in Aden, Abyan, Al-Baydhah, Taiz, Hodeidah and other cities of Yemen. The people have upheld the law. I would like to commend the efforts of the brave national resistance and the national armed forces, who are indeed our partners in struggle and in victory, construction and development. The Assembly is aware of the human tragedy that has befallen our people as a result of the blockade imposed by the militias, which continue their coup d’état. The Assembly is also aware of the deterioration and destruction of public services in liberated provinces. Greater international effort is needed to alleviate the human suffering and to ensure that the Yemeni crisis is not forgotten. While the United Nations has announced an appeal for humanitarian assistance for Yemen, annual contributions continue to fall short and cover only a meagre portion of the actual need.
I therefore take this opportunity to appeal once again to donor countries to ensure that they provide promised assistance. The Government of the Republic of Yemen would like to see the arrival of emergency humanitarian assistance to provide for all provinces without exception. An oversight mechanism for humanitarian convoys, as proposed by the United Nations, would allow for the return of economic prosperity and would facilitate the arrival of humanitarian assistance through all Yemeni ports. Furthermore, the Government has been moved to Aden. I believe that that will lead to better living conditions for our citizens. It will also re-establish basic services, which have been destroyed by the militias of the Houthis and Saleh.
Without a doubt, and quite clearly, that remains the best way for me to remain side by side with my heroic and steadfast people. That has been our position since
15-29437 25/26

A/70/PV.17 29/09/2015
the very beginning of the conflict. We have cooperated with all genuine efforts on the part of the international community and, in particular, with those of Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon and Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, to end the coup d’état, pursuant to Security Council resolution 2216 (2015). Since that resolution, the political process has been resumed, guided by the results of the national dialogue and facilitated by the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Allow me to reiterate that all efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the political crisis should be welcomed and supported. Once again, I would like to convey to the rebels, the Houthi-Saleh militias, that they must lay down their weapons, act in line with reason and implement resolution 2216 (2015) in earnest. I have come here to support peace and accord. I am talking not about a divisive peace but rather of a permanent peace that will be a source of law and order, cohesion and justice. Allow me to advocate for the literal implementation of the most recent Security Council resolution, namely, resolution 2216 (2015), which bears the credibility of the Council itself. I hope that the efforts of the United Nations will be crowned with success. That will ensure that we act in accordance with the aspirations of our people, who have been exceedingly patient and sincere.
Terrorism represents a real threat to States. To the extent of our ability, we have tried to combat terrorism, against which we have conducted a determined campaign, in partnership with friendly countries. The coup d’état and the extremism that ensued created a breeding ground for terrorism. I would like to reiterate, however, our confidence in and support for the Government, which is leading the fight against terrorism with international aid. Given the geographical and strategic location of Yemen, the stability of our country buttresses the stability of the region and the world.
The seventieth session of the General Assembly coincides with the glorious September and October
revolutions of my country. I would like to express my thanks and gratitude to all the Yemeni people, who are a proud and patient people. I would like to restate my commitment to achieving the goals of those two glorious revolutions. We will not allow minority groups, Houthis or others, to repeat the Iranian experience in Yemen. At this time, 70 years since the birth of the United Nations, an Organization that has succeeded in lessening conflicts and wars through its very principles, we reiterate our commitment to working on behalf of future generations. That represents a commitment to those generations, as well as a commitment to making the world more prosperous, safer and free through unity and true determination to achieve the noble ambitions, on which our Organization was established.
The Republic of Yemen condemns in the strongest terms the systematic Israeli attacks against the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Once again, we express our permanent support for the Palestinian people, who are determined to protect the Mosque. A question necessarily arises regarding those recent events. A Government that was created by resolutions of the Security Council refuses to abide by those same resolutions. That is truly surprising.
I would like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his important efforts to achieve the noble ambition of our Organization to ensure international peace and security. I would also like to thank him for his great and commendable efforts to promote the political transition in Yemen, reverse the coup d’état and restore State authority. We wish every success to the General Assembly at its seventieth session.
"
70,2015,MLT,"As we all know, this year constitutes a landmark year for our Organization as we celebrate its seventieth anniversary. The Organization’s founding fathers wanted to turn the ashes of the Second World War into a new order that would secure peace, advance global prosperity, alleviate poverty and promote human rights worldwide. They wanted to
46/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
create what they termed a strong United Nations and a better world.
As we commemorate this seventieth anniversary, let us pause and ask whether today’s world is really a better one. In an era of negativity and media onslaught with respect to global problems, it would be easy to answer “no”, and there are valid reasons to do so. But our duty is, as the standard bearers of optimism, to defy the logic of pessimism and answer “yes”. Indeed, the problems are many, but the world has never experienced such a degree of commitment by global citizens who are looking beyond the notion of the traditional nation State and come together as a global community.
The United Nations has contributed significantly to transforming our world into a safer and more just place for humankind. It has contributed to the eradication of disease, the promotion of justice, freedom and human rights, the attainment of peace in different parts of the world, and to stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Its efforts at mediation and the peacebuilding and peacekeeping successes shepherded by the United Nations have resulted in more people being able to determine their destiny. The Millennium Development Goals spurred us on in our commitment to seek a better life for the poor and the malnourished, and we have now adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (resolution 70/1). If proof were needed that the United Nations can actually make a difference, we have seen it. Indeed, if we reflect over the last 70 years, I believe there is much to be proud of.
The question that needs to be addressed, however, is not whether the United Nations has been a force for good — which it very obviously has — but whether in today’s vastly different world, it is still capable of meeting the challenges it faces. The Organization is, I believe, still a work in progress. We continue to live in a vastly uneven world plagued by conflict, inequality and injustice. New and profound challenges have emerged, many of which are global in nature and which therefore require global solutions.
Last year (see A/69/PV.12), I stressed that more attention needed to be focused on the plight of migrants in the Mediterranean, the cradle of civilization that has now sadly been turned into a graveyard. My country finds itself at the crossroads between the Middle East, Europe and Africa. The tragedy that is occurring so close to home is starkly evident and of immense concern to us. We are the only country in Europe,
and probably the only country around the world, that dedicates 100 per cent of its limited military resources to saving people at sea each and every day.
Last April, we witnessed the funeral of 24 migrants who perished together with 800 others in what is probably the worst-ever-recorded capsizing of a boat laden with migrants in the Mediterranean. Those unnamed individuals were mourned by all of us. Sadly, however, that was not the last tragedy. While many have been rescued through the concerted efforts of European countries, several thousand others have continued to lose their lives on this perilous journey, a journey which they are sometimes forced to take at gunpoint by unscrupulous people smugglers.
So far, this year has broken all records in terms of desperate people attempting to flee from persecution and hopelessness in search of a better life and to attain the right to live in peace, free from anxiety, poverty and persecution. We see it happening in the Mediterranean Sea, and now we see it happening across the Balkans. This proves that it not a Mediterranean problem, nor is it European problem. It is a global phenomenon that needs global responses.
Malta has been highlighting this situation for years and years now in the General Assembly. In November, we will host a summit bringing together the leaders of the European Union and key African nations. The Valletta Summit will be an opportunity to enhance our dialogue and improve our understanding in an attempt to address this issue comprehensively, in a spirit of partnership and cooperation with all the countries involved. It is expected to build and strengthen the present frameworks of action in the field of migration in an effort to address the phenomenon in a more holistic manner and in order to take advantage of the opportunities presented while dealing with the challenge of forced displacement.
The first priority must remain the saving of lives. This is our moral duty as human beings. Europe intensified the search and rescue operations in an attempt to reduce the loss of lives. We are also providing assistance and refuge to those who qualify. Nevertheless, an important and necessary part of the European Union effort requires greater commitment to taking on the smugglers before they can put the lives of more innocent people at risk. The international community should be under no illusion. When it comes to those criminals, we are dealing with individuals
15-29562 47/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
who feed on the desperation of innocent people. In the process, they are making a fortune — and the money is also being used to finance other criminal activities, probably even including terrorism. Those people must be held accountable for their crimes and brought to justice.
Efforts to combat those networks must, in the first instance, be stepped up nationally and regionally. Closer cooperation is essential, most of all among the countries of origin, transit and destination, including through better intelligence-sharing and joint criminal investigations. Improved implementation of national enforcement policies and stronger penalties to punish smugglers are also essential measures to effectively address that challenge.
We have to continue doing our best to give shelter to those fleeing from war and those qualifying for asylum. But it must also be clear that a free-for-all policy is not on the table. People who do not qualify for asylum should be returned. Safe countries of origin that do not help in returns should face sanctions. Those that collaborate should be rewarded with further aid and access to markets.
Nevertheless, tackling the root causes of migration is the only real long-term solution. There are several causes. Starting with development, 2015 is a pivotal year for global sustainable development and poverty eradication. Through the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, agreed to in July, as well as the post- 2015 development agenda, which we welcomed just a few days ago, we are called upon to respond in a transformative manner to the fundamental challenges facing the world today: eradicating poverty, achieving inclusive and sustainable development for present and future generations and ensuring the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental values as the basis for peaceful and prosperous societies. However, we should all be starkly aware that that is only the first step of a process that can be successful only if we are truly fully committed to its implementation.
However, all of those efforts will be futile unless we clearly and determinedly address the long-standing conflicts in the countries of origin and transit. It is not just Malta’s or Europe’s problem. It is everyone’s problem. The United Nations needs to act, as it is morally bound to do. Yes, we have to tackle the war in Syria. But it is a delusion to think that solving Syria will in itself solve the migration phenomenon. What
about Somalia, Eritrea and the whole list of forgotten conflicts generating the mass displacement of people? What about climate change, which is expected to displace so many people? Even in the best-case scenario, we live in a world where the mass displacement of people will be a key feature. That is because we need to recognize that not only desperation makes people move, but also aspiration. People aspire to a better life for themselves and their families. At a time when the world is getting smaller, mothers and fathers, such as ourselves, will set out, believing, rightly or wrongly, that they will secure a better future for their children. We therefore need tools and institutions to establish rules and tackle the phenomenon permanently, not simply as a humanitarian effort, but they should comprise an economic, social and environmental framework to anticipate and manage those flows.
I come from a family of nations that has been very much in the news for failing to agree unanimously on a mandatory distribution system for refugees. I was one of the most vociferous critics in Europe, indicating our failures. Nevertheless, I stand in front of the Assembly today as a proud European. Can anyone mention to me any other group of nations that has gone so far as to agreeing, albeit with considerable birth pangs and bruises, to such a system? There is none. Only Europe has done so to date. Therefore I ask, “Where is everyone else”?
We made a first step. Now the global community has to follow. The United Nations is the apposite forum. At the end of the Second World War, nation States realized that their financial system was broken, that they could no longer operate in a vacuum. The Bretton Woods Agreement laid the basis for rules and institutions to tackle the new reality. We now need a Bretton Woods of migration: rules and institutions that ensure that all the members of the international community, not just the few, share and shoulder the phenomenon of mass migration, with both legal channels and instruments to deal with crises. In other words, a European quota alone should not exist, but a global quota system for migrants, for not only this, but all crises. I urge that such a discussion begin. Let us not allow people smugglers, the criminals, decide for us. Let us read the writing on the wall and lay the foundations for that new system.
On a related subject, in our immediate neighbourhood in the Mediterranean, the escalation in Libya proceeded at such a fast pace that the United Nations responded by taking the lead role to resolve that conflict. The conflict
48/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
is providing all the necessary space for criminals to smuggle people and take control of significant parts of the country. Malta strongly supports the indefatigable efforts of the United Nations to launch a national dialogue for a reconciliation process and the formation of a national unity Government in Libya. Malta recognized and welcomed the initialling of the United Nations-led draft agreement in Morocco last July. The agreement’s initialling was the result of ongoing United Nations-facilitated consultations among various Libyan rival parties.
Hopefully, we will witness an all-inclusive peace agreement. We have to acknowledge the political will and courage demonstrated by those who initialled the draft agreement, which seeks to resolve Libya’s institutional and security crises. The major challenge ahead, especially in neighbouring countries such as ours, is to ensure that the implementation of the agreement is put into effect. All Libyan actors in that process must realize that it is their homeland that needs to be saved, and that all hostilities and violent disputes must cease immediately. The actors must continue to engage actively in an inclusive political dialogue for national reconciliation.
And we must be very sincere. If a complete agreement proves elusive again, it is high time that the United Nations and the global community back those people of good will on both sides of the divide who are willing to reach an agreement, and sideline those on both sides who are simply wasting their people’s future.
This is an important year for my country. For the second time in 10 years, we will very soon host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The summit, guided by the theme “The Commonwealth: Adding Global Value”, will be the culmination of a number of activities and forums, namely, the people’s forum, the youth forum, the business forum and, for the first time, the women’s forum. In organizing the event and our assumption of the chairmanship of the Commonwealth, we plan to address issues of common concern, including global political and security challenges, the most urgent of which is the unprecedented increase in extremism and radicalization, as well as to assess the state of development in the wake of the adoption of the post-2015 agenda and related financing for the development process, with particular attention to practical steps that Commonwealth Governments might take to accelerate the implementation of the outcomes of key global processes.
Malta is confident that the Commonwealth can also provide added value to the international debate on climate change, particularly since that gathering will take place on the eve of the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21). Climate action will be prominently featured on the summit agenda. Noting that the Commonwealth gathers disparate countries from all continents and from vulnerable island States, as well as the Group of 20 economies, the summit will play an important role in strengthening regional and international cooperation and providing support for the successful outcome of COP21. We now look forward to the successful conclusion to the United Nations Paris summit on climate change in December. In seeking to reach an ambitious, fair, balanced and legally binding agreement, we must be principled and practical in our approach.
Malta believes that climate change is a decisive challenge, which if not urgently managed will put at risk not only the environment but also the world’s economic prosperity, development and, more broadly, stability and security. In 1988, our former President, the late Mr. Vincent Tabone, proposed a resolution that called for the world’s climate to be declared the common heritage of humankind (resolution 43/53). The impact of climate change requires a global and coordinated response. Malta was the first to alert the international community to the need to address the warnings on human-induced climate change by the scientific community. We now aspire to being one facilitator among others in securing an equitable deal.
I am of the firm conviction that what binds us together is stronger than what divides us. The challenges we face should unite us as we need to, and indeed we must, face them together. As standard bearers of optimism, we respond to the day’s great problems with even greater resolve. Malta will play its part.
"
70,2015,BTN,"At the outset, I should like to convey to the members of the General Assembly the warm greetings of His Majesty the King of Bhutan. I should also like to congratulate you on your election, Mr. President, and to assure you of my delegation’s full support in the discharge of your responsibilities. I also thank Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, for his able leadership over the past year, in particular in steering to a successful conclusion the complex negotiations on the post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda (resolution 70/1). I also thank
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his team for their tireless efforts to advance the multifaceted work of the Organization over the past year.
At 70, the United Nations, underpinned by multilateralism and the sovereign equality of nations, remains indispensable. It embodies the collective will and conscience of humankind for a more peaceful, secure and prosperous world. Its existence reflects our enduring commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. It unites all nations — big or small, rich or poor — to work together to realize our shared goals and aspirations.
Over the last seven decades, the United Nations has delivered much of what is promised in its Charter, and it is only fitting that we pay tribute to its achievements: from saving millions of lives through relief efforts, vaccinating children, eradicating smallpox and fighting AIDS to feeding millions every year in countries affected by war, conflict and natural disasters; from negotiating peace deals and conducting peacekeeping operations to advancing democracy and creating an international human rights system; and from combating climate change and reducing extreme poverty to preventing the spread and use of nuclear weapons. Those and other achievements of the United Nations are indeed noteworthy.
However, even as we celebrate those achievements, it would serve us well to take stock of the state of our interdependent world and the road ahead for the Organization. For every day we are confronted with compelling evidence that shows we are far from achieving our quest for peace, security, prosperity and human dignity for all — whether it is conflicts and acts of terrorism, the unthinkable stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, the inequalities that persist within and among nations, the rising expectations of billions living at the very margins of existence, or climate change that threatens our very survival — failure to address those interrelated global challenges is not an option.
Peace, security and human rights must go hand in hand with sustainable development. Over the past few years, we have taken stock of the state of our world, our peoples and our planet. We have undertaken a comprehensive review of the challenges and opportunities. And in a spirit of cooperation that many thought impossible, we have adopted an ambitious and transformative Agenda for Sustainable Development. It
18/29 15-29822

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26
is now time to translate the 2030 Agenda into concrete actions in earnest, individually and collectively.
Since joining the United Nations, 44 years ago, under the wise and able leadership of our monarchs the people of Bhutan have endeavoured to fulfil the vision and goals set forth in the Charter. Guided by our development philosophy of Gross National Happiness (GNH), which is essentially development with values, we have consistently worked to ensure that the peace, security, happiness and well-being of our people always remain at the centre of our development efforts.
Bhutan has achieved most of the Millennium Development Goal targets. Poverty has been reduced to 12 per cent. Our primary school enrolment rate is nearly 100 per cent and life expectancy has increased to 68 years. We remain a bastion of environmental conservation with 72 per cent of our land under forest cover. Our effort to safeguard the environment is reinforced by a constitutional mandate to maintain a minimum of 60 per cent of our land under forest cover for all time. Our achievements would not have been possible without good governance. Over decades, under the enlightened leadership of our monarchs, we have successfully embraced democracy.
Peace, security and human rights depend on an all-inclusive approach to development that puts people and the environment at the centre. In 2011, Bhutan spearheaded the adoption of resolution 65/309, entitled “Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development”. A year later, we were gratified by the decision of the General Assembly to observe 20 March each year as the International Day of Happiness. The pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal and embodies the spirit of the 2030 Agenda. We stand ready to share our experience with GNH and to contribute to the growing discourse on holistic development paradigms and indicators.
Even though we have contributed least to the causes of climate change, we, like other least developed countries, are among the most vulnerable to its adverse impacts. Despite our limited resources and competing demands of development, Bhutan remains committed to the conservation of our natural heritage, and in fact has consistently contributed more than its fair share to global efforts to combat climate change. In 2009, Bhutan pledged to remain carbon neutral for all time. We have kept that promise. Our expectation is that, through the sale of clean hydro-power, by 2025 Bhutan will have
the capacity to offset approximately 35 million tons of carbon per annum in the region. That is no small feat, considering Bhutan’s emissions constitute less than 7 per cent of that figure. I am pleased to state that, this week, Bhutan ratified the Doha amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and submitted its intended nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
To support the work of the United Nations in the area of international peace and security, Bhutan began contributing to United Nations peacekeeping operations in 2014. We remain a committed partner and are working to deepen and broaden our peacekeeping engagement with the United Nations. Today it is a matter of great pride that Bhutanese peacekeepers are deployed and serving in nine peacekeeping missions.
We have no doubt that implementing the 2030 Agenda within the next 15 years will be a daunting challenge. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will require countries, both developed and developing alike, to take stock of their existing development strategies and embark on far-reaching reforms to implement the Agenda. For a country like Bhutan, which is least developed and landlocked, addressing the challenges will require innovative and creative approaches to build on the progress we have made thus far.
A key challenge we face is to build a strong and sustainable green economy that ensures gainful employment for our youth, inclusive growth and promotes self-reliance. With a narrow industrial base and a high dependency on a single sector, our economy is faced with unprecedented macroeconomic challenges, despite otherwise prolonged periods of robust economic growth. A careful reorientation of our economy is imperative if we are to ensure that our future development is inclusive and sustainable as envisaged in the 2030 Agenda. In that regard, the continued support and cooperation of our development partners will be crucial as we seek innovative approaches to balance our environmental aspirations and developmental needs. That takes on even greater importance as Bhutan progresses towards graduation from the category of least developed countries to ensure that hard-earned developmental gains are sustained.
I should like to underscore the vital importance of education to achieve our transformative agenda. Many of the SDGs will not be attainable if we do not
15-29822 19/29

A/70/PV.26 02/10/2015
relentlessly invest in building a dynamic and relevant education system in our countries, a system that nurtures our children and youth with the right values, knowledge and skills that reflect our aspirations and goals. In that regard, we are happy to note that ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all is a stand-alone Goal in the 2030 Agenda. In moving forward, SDG 4 must remain at the forefront of our planning and implementation of national strategies to achieve the SDGs. The education sector, which has always been accorded high priority by Bhutan, will be given special emphasis as we mainstream the 2030 Agenda in our national strategies and plans. We hope that our development partners will share our sense of priority and urgency in this vital area and support our efforts to ensure that it is relevant to achieve the 2030 Agenda.
The 2030 Agenda sets out a necessarily ambitious vision and SDGs. We have no doubt of the complexity and enormity of the tasks for its implementation. It will require systemic new thinking and a long-term perspective in our planning. It will require sincere global partnerships, predictable resources and the collaboration and commitment of all our people.
The first litmus test for our commitment to action on the 2030 Agenda will be whether or not we reach an ambitious and legally binding agreement at the twenty- first Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That agreement must be firmly anchored in the principles of the Convention, including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.
Our decisions in Paris must be driven by the latest science. The evidence is unequivocal. An emissions pathway taking us beyond 1.5° C above pre-industrial levels would have disproportionate and irreversible impacts on the most vulnerable among us. A second test of our commitment to action would be whether we are able to deliver on our promises and pledges on the means of implementation for the 2030 Agenda. And, finally, are we able to make tangible progress in the area of United Nations reforms?
Real progress in the revitalization of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council is critical to ensure a robust mechanism for the implementation of the Agenda. Furthermore, the
Security Council must be reformed to reflect current geopolitical realities, through the commencement of text-based negotiations on the basis of decision 69/560, which was adopted by consensus.
The adoption of the 2030 Agenda provides us a historic opportunity to truly awaken our spirit of global solidarity and shared values for the sake of our children and our planet. In the words of His Majesty the King of Bhutan,
“Let us place the interest of humanity, not national populations and constituencies, above all else. Let us take political risks and strong decisions in addressing the needs of humanity. The answer to global problems will come closer at hand when we grasp that universal simplicity — that sense of a shared planet and a shared fate for those who walk on it. We need shared human endeavour not just negotiated change.”
"
70,2015,PSE,"I come before the General Assembly today from Palestine to sound the alarm concerning the grave dangers of what is happening in Jerusalem, where extremist Israeli groups continue with their systematic and repeated incursions into the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Those incursions are aimed at imposing a new reality and at temporarily dividing Haram Al-Sharif by allowing extremists — under the protection of Israeli occupying forces, Ministers and Knesset members — to enter the Mosque. In so doing at specified times, they prevent the access of Muslim
worshipers from freely exercising their religious rights. The Israeli Government is pursuing that plan in direct violation of the status quo of 1967. The occupying Power is thus committing a grave mistake, because we will not accept such actions. The Palestinian people refuses to accept the implementation of an illegal plan that is an affront to the sensitivities of Palestinians and Muslims throughout the world. I call on the Israeli Government, before it is too late, to end the use of brutal force aimed at desecrating the Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, and, in particular, to halt its actions directed against the Al-Aqsa Mosque, for such actions will transform the conflict from a political to a religious one and create an explosive situation in Jerusalem, as well as in the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory.
It is my honour to come to speak on behalf of the State of Palestine in the General Assembly at its seventieth session, which coincides with the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, which has made the promotion and protection of international peace and security and the preservation of human rights its primary goals.
The question of Palestine was one of the first just causes brought before the United Nations, dating from the time of its inception. Yet, to date, regrettably, it remains unresolved. The Organization and its Members remain unable to end the injustice inflicted upon our people or to assist it in exercising its right to self- determination and freedom in its own independent and sovereign State.
I ask the Assembly to reconsider the history of the question of Palestine and the relevant United Nations resolutions in order to realize a self-evident truth. A historic injustice was inflicted upon a people who had lived peacefully in their land and made genuine intellectual, cultural and humanitarian contributions to humankind and their homeland. That people does not deserve to be deprived of its homeland, to die in exile, to be swallowed by the sea or to spend its life fleeing from one refugee camp to another. Yet, regrettably, its just cause remains at a standstill after these many years.
Our people have placed their hopes in the countries of this Organization to help them to gain their freedom, independence and sovereignty, so that their wish and their right to their own State, which is the aspiration of all peoples of the Earth, can be achieved. That entails a just solution for the Palestine refugee issue
26/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
in accordance with resolution 194 (III) and the Arab Peace Initiative. Is that too much to ask?
We are calling for justice, peace and what is right. Palestine was partitioned into two States, and Israel was established 67 years ago. But the second part of resolution 181 (II), of 29 November 1947, still awaits implementation. Palestine, which is an observer State in the United Nations, deserves full recognition and full membership. In the light of all the enormous sacrifices that we have made, our years of patience in exile and suffering, and our acceptance of peace in accordance with the two-State solution, which should be based on international law, the relevant United Nations resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative and the Quartet road map, it is unconscionable that the question of Palestine has remained unresolved for all these decades.
The continuation of the impasse is unacceptable, because it means yielding to the logic of the brute force that is being inflicted upon us by the Israeli Government. That Government continues its illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank, especially in occupied East Jerusalem. It continues its blockade of the Gaza Strip, deepening the immense suffering of our people there, in defiance of United Nations resolutions and the agreements signed by both sides under international auspices. In that regard, we recall the words of the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1976, when he stated that Israel would become an apartheid State if it continued its occupation of Palestinian territory. He described the Israeli settlements on Palestinian land as a cancer. That is what Yitzhak Rabin said. Why do they do that to us?
The persistence of the issue forces us to ask the following questions. Do the votes of democratic countries against Palestine-related resolutions and the legitimate rights of our people serve peace and the interests of those who believe in the two-State solution? Or do they serve and encourage extremists, thereby fanning their hatred and racism and making them believe that they are above the law, to the point that they committed the crime of burning a Palestinian family in the town of Duma in the West Bank, a crime which claimed the lives of an infant, Ali Dawabsheh, his father and mother? What is left of this family is an orphan child, Ahmed, a 4-year-old, who teeters between life and death in hospital as a result of his burns, while the killers remain free because they have not yet been arrested. Where is justice? Where is fairness? Where
is democracy? Where is the democratic State that lays claim to democracy and the rule of law?
This was not the first crime of this type. On previous occasions, they had burned alive and killed a Palestinian child, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, in Jerusalem, and another, Mohammed Al-Dura, in Gaza, and before them thousands had been killed in Gaza and the West Bank. We still remember the Deir Yassin massacre of 1948 and all other crimes committed against our people. All of these crimes have gone unpunished. Until when will Israel remain above international law and without accountability?
Owing to time constraints, I shall not be able to discuss in detail how many Israeli violations have been committed against our people and how many repressive laws have been issued by successive Israeli Governments, the latest of which is the official governmental instructions given to fire live ammunition at and arrest and repress peaceful Palestinian demonstrators. Why is this happening?
We do not respond to the hatred and brutality of the Israeli occupation with hatred and brutality. Instead, we are working to spread the culture of peace and coexistence between our peoples and in our region. We are eager to see the day when our people and all peoples in our region will enjoy peace, security, stability and prosperity. This cannot be achieved with continued occupation, settlement, colonization, the wall, the burning of people, places of worship and homes, the killing of youth, children and infants, the burning of crops, and the arrest and detention of people without charge or trial.
How can a State claim that it is an oasis of democracy and that its courts and security apparatus function according to the law and yet also accept the existence of so-called price-tag gangs and other known terrorist organizations that terrorize and intimidate our people, confiscate their property and insult their holy sites? All of this occurs under the watch of the Israeli army and police, who do not deter or punish the gangs, but rather provide them with protection.
Is it not time to end these injustices? Is it not time to stop this suffering? Is it not time for the racist annexation wall to be torn down? Is it not time for the humiliating and degrading checkpoints and barriers set up by the Israeli occupying forces in our land to be removed? Is it not time for the Israeli blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip to be lifted so that our people can
15-29562 27/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
move in freedom and dignity in their own homeland and beyond? Is it not time to end the racist, terrorist, colonial settlement of our land, which is undermining the two-State solution? Is it not time for the 6,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails to see the light of freedom and live among their families and communities? Is it not time for the longest occupation in history, which is suffocating our people, to come to an end? These are the questions we ask the international community.
Despite all the obstacles imposed by the occupation, since the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority and until this moment, we have worked tirelessly to build the foundations of our State, its infrastructure and sovereign national institutions. We have made real progress on the ground, as has been affirmed by several international bodies, in particular the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. With the support of our brothers and friends, we will continue our efforts and work together to strengthen our State, which is committed to upholding international standards, the rule of law and transparency as a democratic and modern State. In this context, we highly value the efforts of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, under Norway’s chairmanship, and urge donor countries to continue to support a better life for our people and our efforts to develop our State institutions.
Our membership in international organizations and our accession to treaties and conventions are not directed against anyone; rather, they are a measure aimed at safeguarding our rights, protecting our people, harmonizing the laws and regulations of our country with international standards, and strengthening its international legal status and identity. Is this a mistake?
With respect to the internal Palestinian situation, we are determined to preserve the unity of our land and our people. We will not accept temporary solutions or a fragmented State. We will not allow this to happen, and we will not let those who are trying to make us do this prevail. We will instead seek to form a Government of national unity that functions according to the programme of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and we will proceed to hold presidential and legislative elections.
Palestine is a country of holiness and peace. It is the birthplace of Christ, the messenger of love and peace, and the home of the Isra and Mi’raj, the ascension to
heaven and night journey of Mohammed, peace be upon him, who was sent as a gift of mercy to the world. Palestine is still looking for peace, and its people want to live in their homeland in safety, security, harmony, stability and good neighbourliness with all peoples and countries of the region. This is attested to by their cultural, humanitarian and spiritual contributions to humankind all along, from the start.
Just recently, on 17 May, two nuns from Palestine, Marie-Alphonsine Ghattas and Mariam Baouardy, were canonized as saints by His Holiness Pope Francis at the Vatican in the presence of tens of thousands of the faithful from around the globe. On that occasion, the flag of Palestine was raised at the Vatican, whose recognition of the State of Palestine is documented in the agreement signed between the Holy See and the State of Palestine. It is our hope that those that have not yet recognized us as a State will do so as soon as possible. We look forward to seeing the independent State of Palestine take its rightful place among the community of nations. We are confident that it will actively contribute to achieving the economic, cultural and humanitarian progress of civilization, with positive results for our people, the region and the entire world.
Peace will be achieved by and through Palestine. Those who wish to seek and promote peace, I repeat, those who wish to seek and promote peace and to fight terrorism, should start by resolving the question of Palestine. That is the beginning and the end of it.
I take the opportunity to express, on behalf of my people, our thanks to all those who, on 10 September, voted in favour of resolution 69/320. Its adoption has enabled us to raise the Palestinian flag at United Nations Headquarters. The day is not far off when, God willing, we will raise the Palestinian flag in East Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Palestine.
I wish also to pay tribute to various recent decisions in European parliaments. Some of these have clearly condemned Israel’s settlement activities and affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to sovereignty and independence in their own State, side by side with the State of Israel — which we recognize even though Israel does not recognize our existence — and some have established a committee on relations with Palestine. A number of European countries have also affirmed their recognition of the State of Palestine, thereby endorsing our natural right to independence. In that regard, we wish to thank the Kingdom of Sweden for having the
28/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
courage of its convictions and recognizing the State of Palestine.
All who say they support the two-State solution must recognize both States, not just one. If one supports the two-State solution, how can one not recognize the other State? Today I call on those countries that have not yet recognized the State of Palestine to do so. We are fully confident that they will do so out of conviction that our people and cause are deserving of justice. From this rostrum at United Nations Headquarters and against the backdrop of the religious holidays, I extend a sincere call on the people of Israel for peace based on justice, security and stability for all. I also call on the Security Council and the General Assembly to shoulder their responsibilities before it is too late. I sincerely hope that they will fulfil their responsibilities before it is too late.
All those present are well aware that Israel has undermined the efforts of the Administration of President Barack Obama, and mostly recently the efforts undertaken by Secretary of State Kerry, to reach a peace agreement by means of negotiation. The polices and practices of the Israeli Government and the stances adopted by its Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers lead to a clear conclusion, namely, that they are doing their utmost to sabotage the two-State solution that we have been seeking based on resolutions of international legitimacy. There can be no other explanation.
We welcome the international and European efforts, including the French initiative calling for the formation of an international support group on achieving peace. The Arab States, at their recent summit, confirmed their support for a Security Council resolution to reaffirm the key parameters for a peaceful two-State solution, based on the pre-1967 borders, with a time frame for ending the occupation.
As it is pointless to waste time negotiating just for the sake of it, what we require now is to mobilize international efforts and establish a framework to oversee an end to the occupation, in line with the resolutions of international legitimacy. Until that is done, I appeal to the United Nations, and particularly the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly, to provide international protection for the Palestinian people in accordance with international humanitarian law. We need protection — we need international protection. We cannot maintain the status quo. We are being assailed on all sides. Acts of
aggression are being committed against us on all sides. We have no protector. Our last resort is the United Nations. We are therefore appealing to the Assembly, we are begging the Assembly, to provide us with international protection.
We have tried to bring pressure to bear on Israel to implement the signed agreements and to negotiate in conformity with the two-State solution through direct contact with the Israeli Government. Yes, we do maintain direct contact with the Israeli Government, as well as indirect contact through the United States of America, the Russian Federation, the European Union and the United Nations, the Quartet members and other parties. However, the Israeli Government persists in undermining the two-State solution and in entrenching two regimes on the ground: the current apartheid regime imposed on the State of Palestine and against the Palestinian people, on the one hand, and another regime of extensive privileges and protection for Israeli settlers, on the other hand. Our occupied Palestinian territory reflects two systems: the apartheid system and the other system that extends extensive privileges to the Israeli settlers. How is that possible? In what way is it admissible? That is the question that we pose to the United Nations.
The transitional Oslo accords and annexes and the subsequent accords signed with Israel stipulated that the agreements should be implemented within a time frame of five years, which ended in 1999. What was the outcome to be? It was to be full independence for the State of Palestine and the end of the Israeli occupation. But Israel stopped withdrawing its forces from the areas classified as “B” and “C”, which represent more than 60 per cent of the West Bank territory, including East Jerusalem. Instead, Israel intensified its settlement activities everywhere, in breach of all of the signed accords, some of which were signed by the current Israeli Prime Minister.
In 2009, in his speech in Cairo, President Obama called for the cessation of the settlement activities. What was the response on the part of Israel? The Government increased its settlement activities by at least 20 per cent in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, thus violating its obligation not to undertake any illegal or unilateral action that could be considered permanent. Moreover, the occupying Power has repeatedly encroached on the area classified as “A”, which is supposed to be under full Palestinian security jurisdiction and in which we have
15-29562 29/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
established the institutions of the Palestinian State. Let me repeat that, yes, Israel has also violated that area.
At the same time, Israel refuses to review the economic agreements that control the ability of the Palestinian economy to develop and become independent. It is determined to impose dominance on the Palestinian economy, similar to its military and security dominance, and it rejects the right of the Palestinian people to development and to the exploitation of their natural resources. In so doing, Israel has undermined the foundations on which the political and security agreements are based. Those agreements have also been eroded by the measures taken by successive Israeli Governments, measures that have negated the transitional phase leading to the independence of our State. All these gross violations of the agreements have made the situation intolerable.
Given that background, we declare that as long as Israel refuses to commit to the agreements it signed with us, thereby ensuring that we are a pro forma authority without real powers, and as long as Israel refuses to cease its settlement activities and to release the fourth group of Palestinian prisoners in accordance with our agreements, Israel leaves us no choice but to assert that we will not remain the only ones committed to the implementation of those agreements, while Israel continuously violates them.
We therefore declare that we cannot continue to be bound by those agreements and that Israel must fully assume all its responsibilities as an occupying Power, because the status quo cannot continue and the decisions of the Palestinian Central Council last March are specific and binding. As long as Israel does not commit to the signed agreements and instead undermines them all, we, for our part, renounce our commitment to those agreements, and Israel must bear full responsibility for the situation. This is a decision taken by the Palestinian Parliament, and I affirm it right here and now. Our patience has run out. It seems that Israel is deaf to the truth. Israel will have to resume its role as an occupying Power and bear its responsibilities accordingly.
The State of Palestine, based on the 4 June 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, is a State under occupation. Yes, we are under occupation, just as many countries were during the Second World War. It should be noted that our State is recognized by 137 States, which is four times the number of States that recognized Israel at its foundation, and the right of our
people to self-determination, freedom and independence is recognized globally as being inalienable and indisputable. I further recall resolution 67/19 of 2012, which accorded to Palestine observer State status and reaffirmed that the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization would be the interim Government of the State of Palestine and that the Palestine National Council would be the Palestinian Parliament of the State of Palestine. Given all that, why does Israel not recognize the State of Palestine?
I must reiterate that the current situation is unsustainable. We shall start implementing the declaration I have just announced by legal means. We shall not resort to violence; we shall use peaceful and legal means to implement it. Either the Palestine National Authority will be a transitional power and move the Palestinian people from occupation to independence, or Israel must fully bear its responsibilities as the occupying Power.
At the same time, and based on our commitment to the principles of international law, the State of Palestine will continue to accede to international conventions and to join organizations — all international organizations. That is our right and is fully in line with our status under international law. Palestine will move forward in the defence of its people under occupation through all available legal and peaceful means, including as a High Contracting Party to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and a State party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Yes, Palestine is a State party to the International Criminal Court. Those who fear international law and international courts should stop committing crimes. We do not like having to seek justice from the International Criminal Court, but aggression forces us to do so. We will seek support from all international organizations, including the International Criminal Court.
All that notwithstanding, my hand remains outstretched for the just peace that will guarantee my people’s rights, freedom and human dignity. I say to our neighbours, the sons and daughters of the Israeli people, that peace is in their interest and in our interest and in the interest of their future generations and our future generations. Maintaining a narrow viewpoint is unhelpful and destructive. Focusing only on oneself is unhelpful and destructive. It is my sincere hope that those neighbours will consider the dangerous reality on the ground and look to the future and accept for the Palestinian people what they accept for themselves.
30/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
Then, they will find that the achievement of peace will be possible, and they will enjoy security, safety, peace and stability. These values are the aspirations that we also seek to realize for our Palestinian people.

70,2015,RWA,"The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (resolution 70/1) marks a new era in international cooperation. Ending extreme poverty was never going to be enough to fulfil our ambitions. This new compact is about prosperity, and it recognizes that the only sustainable future is one that includes all of us. It could hardly be otherwise. The creativity and dynamism of billions of people is already transforming our world for the better. That is thanks to improved health, education and access to new technologies and to empowering women to take their rightful place in the world.

as never before. Cooperation is the only way forward. And yet the new consensus on sustainable development is incomplete, because it lacks a shared definition of the political legitimacy required to sustain that international order.
That divergence of visions is rooted in history. When world powers created the United Nations 70 years ago, independence for the colonized peoples of Africa and Asia was not on the agenda. We were still seen as people who needed to be looked after. Those moral hierarchies and prejudices are still with us, contributing to the mismanagement of political change and corroding the trust on which effective multilateral cooperation depends.
The internal character of national systems counts for everything. It cannot be bypassed. Political legitimacy is not a legal abstraction. It is an objective reality that can be measured, for example, in terms of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as in terms of indicators of public opinion. We face serious challenges that we must confront together as an international community. We cannot afford to undermine the most responsible and capable members by applying standards to some countries that are not applied to others, and even by imposing inappropriate ones.
To take just one example, international refugee law has barely been a factor in the current crisis, as if the purpose all along was more to keep refugees encamped far from developed countries than to protect the rights of people fleeing persecution. In other cases,
multilateral institutions are used to gain credibility for biased attacks on countries even while scrutiny of the powerful is considered unnecessary. When matters of principle become associated with domination and disdain, the basis for joint action in the multilateral system is compromised.
We have nothing to fear from high standards. The only stability worth having is one based on good policies that deliver real results for citizens and facilitate peaceful change. Human dignity and even survival are implied in that. No country or system has a monopoly on wisdom, much less a claim to moral superiority. Our task is to settle the future, not the past. Change is coming, and it is necessary. No one can manage it alone, and the Sustainable Development Goals rightly recognize our mutual interdependence. We have made good commitments; now we must make good on them. Building a community with a shared purpose that is capable of doing so starts with recognition of our equality.
"
70,2015,MEX,"Seventy years ago, the United Nations was founded as a collective
response to the horror of war. For seven decades, the peoples of the United Nations have been determined to implement the highest ideals of international peace and security, human rights and social progress.
The ongoing efforts of the United Nations in favour of these lofty goals are reflected in the peacekeeping operations and the actions of such prestigious agencies as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Development Programme. It must be said clearly — the world would not be the same without the United Nations, symbol of solidarity and hope for a better future.
Since 1945, Mexicans have maintained the greatest commitment to this forum, which is the greatest multilateral mechanism there is, championing peace, nuclear disarmament and humankind’s loftiest goals. For example, following the Cuban missile crisis, Mexico promoted the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean. Thanks to this agreement, the Latin American and Caribbean nations became the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a densely populated region.
Mexicans also have a long tradition as a mediator in conflicts in our region, always promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes. In the light of this history, we welcome the substantial progress in the peace process in Colombia, as well as the recent restoration of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. Consistent with this new geopolitical reality, we reiterate the call for ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba since 1962.
To continue contributing to peace among societies of the world, Mexico recently pushed for the Arms Trade Treaty, which is now a reality. The Treaty is the basis of an international regime of conventional arms control, which prevents illegal traffic and makes the legal trade in arms more transparent.
Mexico is a nation fully committed to upholding the law, human rights and peace. We have fully assumed the great responsibility of being a member of the Human Rights Council of the United Nations for the 2014-2016 triennium. Today, my country has some of the most advanced legislation in favour of human rights and works to ensure that it is enforced throughout the national territory. Moreover, I am
convinced — and the facts bear this out — that the experience and contributions of the international community have helped to further our domestic efforts in the field. The imminent visit to Mexico of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is a clear demonstration of our commitment and will to continue to join efforts with the international system.
Another clear example of our responsibility at the global level was the decision to participate in peacekeeping operations. Our historic resolve has meant that my country has put its experience in the field of humanitarian assistance at the service of the United Nations. The foregoing are just some examples of the close and positive relationship that Mexico has had with the United Nations for 70 years.
As a result of growing inequalities, an unrelenting global economic crisis and the social frustration resulting therefrom, the world today is exposed to the threat of new populist movements, some on the left and others on the right, but all equally risky. The twentieth century has already lived through and suffered the consequences of the actions of individuals who, devoid of understanding and a sense of responsibility and without a moral compass, chose to divide their populations. Societies must be vigilant against those who prey on fears and worries and those who sow hatred and rancour with the sole purpose of satisfying political agendas and personal ambitions.
In this second decade of the twenty-first century, we must not repeat the mistakes that caused the world so much pain in the past. On the contrary, it is time to rescue and support the principles that define us as people: the lofty values that gave birth to the United Nations, namely, peace, solidarity and respect for human rights — respect for migrants, respect for women, respect for all races and religions, respect for diversity and political pluralism, but, above all, respect for human dignity. That is what our societies deserve.
True, today’s world is complex, uncertain, almost beyond our reach. But division is not a solution. We must again appreciate the true worth of trust— trust in constructive work, trust in others, trust in institutions and, above all, trust in ourselves and our nations.
To build, one must add; to achieve, one must persevere. Indeed, 2015 is proving to us that nations can achieve transcendent, bold and innovative agreements that benefit the world’s population. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), the
Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the work leading up to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on Climate Change are of historic importance and promote a new paradigm — a change in the way nations think and act.
The way in which the 2030 Agenda was constructed should be welcomed. It was compiled collectively and unanimously, from the dialogues and proposals submitted by Member States. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda, adopted at the third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Ethiopia, will enable States to finance sustainable development, which is the foundation of a revitalized global partnership, as the Secretary-General himself has stated. For its part, the Sendai Framework provides guidelines for the next 15 years that will give the people of the world an opportunity to enjoy a more secure home.
As for the upcoming twenty-first Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, there are high expectations that we will be able to adopt binding commitments in Paris. Undoubtedly, climate change is one of the greatest challenges of the day, and its solution requires the clear and firm political will of every country. In that regard, on 27 March Mexico introduced its nationally determined contribution, and was the first developing country to do so. From this rostrum, I reiterate our call on all nations of the world to act with determination and vision in response to the challenge of climate change.
Encouraged by the major agreements of 2015, we are now moving forward on the reform and modernization of the Security Council. The design of that important mechanism, created in 1945, has already demonstrated significant limitations. It is unacceptable that the power of the veto has been used for exclusively national purposes, thereby holding back potential international action. The permanent members of the Security Council have a special responsibility for international peace and security, which they must assume at all times, especially when the most basic human rights are violated. With that objective in mind, we have supported the initiative of France to restrict the use of the veto in cases of serious breach of international law and human rights violations, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The aim is to ensure that United Nations
resolutions are more effective, responsible and, above all, more representative of the ideals of humankind.
In the global era, no country is immune to what happens elsewhere in the world. We cannot remain indifferent to the suffering of entire populations. It is a fact that our time is characterized by the migration of millions of people seeking better living conditions. Unfortunately, on all continents and in all areas, the migrant experience is one of risk, rejection, discrimination and abuse. Those conditions are aggravated when, because of ignorance, bad faith, racism or pure political opportunism, migrants and their children are stigmatized and blamed for the destination country’s own difficulties. We must not allow that injustice to continue. We must not allow the democracies of the world to be robbed of their pluralistic and inclusive spirit. In the light of those visions of exclusion and discrimination, we must unite our efforts to create a global scheme to protect migrants’ rights commensurate with the challenges we are experiencing. Around the world, millions of migrants require a collective and effective response — a global response that should come from the United Nations.
Similarly, given the scarce results achieved during the past decades, humankind must reassess its vision of the global drug problem. In Mexico, we consider it indispensable to have a more effective, just and humane international response. In 2016, during the upcoming special session of the General Assembly on drugs, the international community must demonstrate collective willingness to break its inertia and develop policies that put the well-being and dignity of individuals at the heart of our attention.
Ensuring the purposes and principles that gave birth to the United Nations is a responsibility that unites and commits us all. Mexico publicly expresses its appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his work at the head of the United Nations. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is an overwhelming example of the inclusive leadership that the world requires.
On this, the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, Mexico reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the Organization that unites nations and calls upon them to work together. We do so in the conviction that multilateralism is the ideal way to overcome global problems. We do so in the conviction that through support for the United Nations we can help build a better future for all humankind."
70,2015,KNA,"It is indeed an honour for me to address this organ of the United Nations in my capacity as Prime Minister of Saint
Kitts and Nevis, a privilege of service bestowed on me following our people’s historic victory at the polls in February of this year. I take pleasure in sharing the perspectives of the Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis on matters that are before the General Assembly at its seventieth session.
My delegation is pleased that the focus of the general debate, “The United Nations at 70: a new commitment to action”, will shed special light on the Sustainable Development Goals, which form the basis of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). We are in full agreement with the Assembly that the new partnerships for sustainable development will be at the centre of the work of the United Nations until the year 2030. We are optimistic that the post-2015 development agenda, when taken in conjunction with the recently adopted Addis Ababa Action Agenda and a forward-looking and responsible outcome at the Paris Climate Change Conference in December, represents a courageous step forward for humankind that, if fully implemented, will yield the kind of future that our children and grandchildren deserve.
So onward with action — the action that is required to create decent jobs for our people, build schools for our children, deliver quality health care for all and provide affordable homes to our working mothers and fathers. Be assured that Saint Kitts and Nevis stands committed to the process of implementation, which of course must include a robust, systematic and effective monitoring and review process.
Climate change is of utmost importance for us. It must never be placed on the proverbial back burner. I dare submit that for small island developing States (SIDS), like Saint Kitts and Nevis, it remains an existential threat. Our economic, social and environmental well- being is threatened by natural disasters, including devastating floods and persistent droughts, by sea-level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification. Those acts of nature have the capacity to undermine our economic growth, threaten food security and bring hardships on our people. The challenge to our vital tourism industry is unsettling, and the loss of entire coastal communities is devastating to our islands. The current situation in Dominica represents what islands face when dealing with climate change. We call on the international community to do more to help small island developing States adapt and adjust. We would like consideration
15-29816 17/45

A/70/PV.25 02/10/2015
to be given not just to climate change adaptation and mitigation, but also to disaster response, recovery and insurance.
When we speak of adaptation to climate change and the wider issue of disaster-risk mitigation, it is incumbent on us to underscore the significant financial burden that is placed on national budgets by projects designed to build resilience and increase our chances of survival in the face of climate events. Access to global funding mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund is of critical importance to us. For too long we have been hamstrung by complex application procedures that have prevented us from accessing the vital funds needed to enable us to achieve sustainable development. We appreciate the recent decision by the Green Climate Fund Board to aim for a floor of 50 per cent of the adaptation allocation for particularly vulnerable countries. We also appreciate the importance placed on filling capacity gaps in assessing and managing climate finance. Access to finance, if it is to be meaningful, must be simplified and it must be timely.
My delegation welcomes the establishment of the SIDS DOCK facility for sustainable energy, which will serve as a clearing house for the implementation of climate-related projects in small island developing States. We acknowledge the assistance provided by our partners in development. We are convinced that working closely with our partners to build effective and meaningful partnerships will accelerate the pathway to achieving sustainable development in all its dimensions.
Saint Kitts and Nevis has emerged as a leader in renewable energy development in the Caribbean. Even now, our country has a mix of wind and solar power in our energy grid. By 2016, we shall add a waste-to-energy programme and by 2018 we shall add geothermal energy on the island of Nevis. We are working assiduously to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and so reduce our carbon footprint. In that ambitious agenda, I thank all our international partners who have lent their technical assistance and expertise in advancing the renewable energy trust in my country.
The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis is fully committed to social equity, justice, people’s empowerment, good governance, transparency and, of course, prosperity for all. We are a people’s Government, born out of the desire to put the development of our people first. We therefore are hoping to build broader constituencies of support on several fronts to address the problem of crime.
At home, we instituted a six-point plan in our fight to reduce violent crime, in particular. We are investing in new equipment and training to support our law enforcement professionals in the prevention, detection and solving of crimes. We are working hard to build a new professional culture among and between our law enforcement agencies. We are encouraged by new statistics pointing to a decline in major crimes in the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, while accepting at the same time that much more still needs to be done.
Our Government is determined to aggressively confront the issues of crime. We will work on multiple tracks, including working to empower families and communities through education, skills development initiatives and civic programmes. We will work in schools, with non-governmental organizations, with our religious leaders and with the youths themselves, especially those most likely to become targets or perpetrators of criminal behaviour. We will offer them alternatives and opportunities for personal growth, decent work and constructive engagement in our society. It is a challenge to which we are committed and which we have to win.
However, if small States are to overcome the challenges posed and exacerbated by transnational criminal activities, we must work in partnership. We need the support of gun-producing countries to restrict the movement of illegal guns, light weapons and ammunition. Those who produce firearms must do more to stop them from reaching our shores. We must share information and improve access to opportunities, education and employment, because sustainable development is not achievable in an environment of crime and violence. Prosperity must be built brick by brick, day by day, and is realizable solely in the context of peaceful and safe societies.
Saint Kitts and Nevis, like the rest of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), has consistently lent its voice to the clarion call for greater attention to the harmful impact of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) on our main resource: our human capital. We continue to wrestle with the high incidence of diseases like cancer, heart disease, diabetes and hypertension in our country and, indeed, throughout the CARICOM region. We wish to reiterate our call for a stronger global response in combating NCDs in developing countries like ours. We remain hopeful that the inclusion of NCDs in the Sustainable Development Goals and the implementation of the targets and indicators at the
18/45 15-29816

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25
national level will reverse the high incidence of NCDs at the national, regional and global levels. The famous adage “A nation’s health is a nation’s wealth” resonates well with us. We therefore urge the United Nations system to play a leading role in that regard through its specialized agencies and regional offices.
We are pleased with the work of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and our Pan Caribbean Partnership against HIV/AIDS in CARICOM, and we call for continued global solidarity in that endeavour. My own country is on track to achieve zero mother- to-child transmission by the end of 2015, and we are committed to the aim of making CARICOM the first region in the world to end AIDS by 2030.
My Government is pleased to draw the international community’s attention to the invaluable contribution by the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the areas of international cooperation, health, technology and peace and security. We live in an age when global partnership is a prerequisite for solving complex problems at the international level. The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis is proud to announce that a relationship established more than three decades ago has yielded benefits in every area of sustainable development. Such a level of engagement between a developing country and its partner in development is indeed a model fit for consideration by small States such as ours in their quest to achieve sustainable development.
As we looked for models and arrangements that would advance our global agenda, we found pragmatic, beneficial value in our PetroCaribe agreement with Venezuela in support of poverty alleviation and social cohesion. Venezuela, under President Chávez and now under President Maduro, must be commended for showing the world that there can be a better and more helpful way to drive the development agenda. Saint Kitts and Nevis is of course cognizant of the territorial issues that exist between Venezuela and our fellow CARICOM member State of Guyana. We expect the leaders of Venezuela and Guyana to resolve their issues peacefully and in accordance with international law. My Government stands willing to assist alongside CARICOM in resolving those very challenging issues.
Saint Kitts and Nevis is indeed pleased by the recent decision of the Governments of Cuba and the United States of America to re-establish diplomatic relations, a solution that CARICOM has long advocated. It is an opportune time for us to usher in a new era of regional
partnership and cooperation. My own country has benefited substantially from capacity-building in the areas of education and health thanks to our partnership with Cuba. We applaud several prescriptions outlined in the address of President Castro to the Assembly (see A/70/PV.14) that call for better arrangements for Caribbean countries and for special and differential treatment.
We concur that the issue of reparation must be seen in the broader context of the evil of slavery and its lingering negative impact on the development of the Caribbean. Reparation has to be considered a pathway to addressing the continuing disadvantages that slavery has inflicted on our economies and societies.
As part of our development agenda, Saint Kitts and Nevis will work daily to ensure that every citizen has access to high-quality health care, a twenty-first-century education, decent work and an improved quality of life consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda. We remain eager to work within the United Nations system, but the United Nations must be re-energized, retooled and refocused to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. In fact, we want to see a United Nations strengthened and reflective of the reality of our world, the needs of its membership and the wishes of our diverse and swelling populations.
In Saint Kitts and Nevis, we are building a modern, responsible and responsive society, rooted in democracy and the rule of law. We are optimistic that in the months and years ahead, the United Nations and its specialized agencies will be more robust, nimble, modern and responsive in order to complement our work and be better able to prevent crises in ways that effectively improve lives. Through such commitments and actions we will transform our beloved Saint Kitts and Nevis, the United Nations and indeed the world. God bless the country and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis.
"
70,2015,DNK,"Seventy years ago, this Organization was born out of the chaos and ruins of the Second World War. It was born with the hope and a vision that the future would be better and more peaceful than the past. Small and large countries signed the Charter of the United Nations; my own country was signatory number 50. It was a commitment to solving common problems through cooperation and dialogue. How is today’s world compared to that of our grandparents? The answer is simple. Much progress has been made.
We live in a world that is wealthier. Millions have been lifted out of poverty. There is a dramatic increase in the number of children — and in particular girls — attending schools. We continue to witness horrible conflicts in many parts of the world, but the number and magnitude of armed conflicts between States have decreased. Our fight against deadly diseases has saved millions. This is one side of the coin. We also live in a changing world. Conflicts remain the greatest threat to human development. The number of refugees and displaced persons is growing at an alarming speed. Violent extremism is spreading. Human rights are being violated. Our planet is under stress due to scarce resources and climate change. That is the other side of the coin.
The world is complex, as it has always been. There are no simple solutions and there never were. We need to engage actively and cooperate closely to address the challenges today, as we did 70 years ago. From my perspective, there are three main priorities for the United Nations in the coming years. First, peace and security. Like many others in my generation, my political view of the world was shaped by 1989. The wall came down. The Iron Curtain disappeared. Today, once again, the world faces a situation where cooperation and dialogue are all too often replaced by force and violence. We must ensure that the United Nations can effectively provide security in the face of ever more complex crises and threats.
In Ukraine, we have seen completely unacceptable violations of international law and principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. In Syria, civilians suffer from horrific abuses committed by the terrorist organization, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and by the Al-Assad regime. The Danish Government continues to support efforts for a political solution to the conflict, and we are proud to be a member of the international coalition against ISIL. We need a strong and unified response to violent extremism and terrorism, not just in Syria and Iraq, but also in parts of Africa, where violent extremism and armed conflicts are growing. Denmark will do its part. We plan to increase our contribution to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali.
Massive refugee and migration flows are a visible consequence of these conflicts. Almost 60 million people are fleeing their homes. We have an international responsibility to provide the necessary protection
for refugees. Many of them have no food, medicine, schools for their children or hope for the future. They need our support. Denmark takes this responsibility very seriously. Last year, we were the second-largest recipient of Syrian refugees, per capita, in the European Union.
I also welcome the initiative of the Secretary- General to strengthen United Nations peace operations, but we need more than Blue Helmets to ensure lasting peace. We need a Security Council that is ready to take the necessary decisions to maintain international peace and security, and effectively address conflicts in a timely manner and that reflects the world as it is today. The international community must have the right instruments to adequately tackle the situation, and we must keep an open mind when we evaluate the instruments we have at hand.
Many people migrate for economic reasons, in search of a better life, and their hopes are indeed understandable. But mass migration is obviously an immense challenge for our societies, our international cooperation and our solidarity. First and foremost, mass migration is a global challenge, and we must address its root causes. People migrate because they have lost hope at home. Inclusive economic growth in developing countries should be our common goal. There are no easy solutions.
The United Nations is an important part of the answer. Member States have the primary responsibility for development and progress in their own countries. But we must all do our part and provide the necessary financial contributions to ensure that they succeed. Denmark is ready to do its part, as we have done since 1978. We remain committed to the United Nations target of providing development assistance amounting to 0.7 per cent of our gross domestic product. Denmark is widely recognized as a leading humanitarian donor, and we will continue to give the area high priority. Last week, my Government decided to allocate an additional €100 million to humanitarian assistance and to measures that support European efforts to address the mass migration from Syria and its neighbourhood. I am deeply concerned about the probability that the humanitarian needs associated with this will far outgrow the available financing, and I call on all States to increase their humanitarian efforts. The international community must find solutions to this extraordinary situation.
That leads me to our next priority, human rights and gender equality. The Charter of the United Nations says very clearly that the equal and indispensable rights of all people are the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. The best way to build a better world is to unleash the power of the individual for the sake of the common good. Today, more people live in democracies than ever before, but the lives of many are still threatened because of who they are or what they believe. Denmark has always pursued an active human rights policy, based on dialogue as the key tool to progress.
My Government is a strong advocate of women’s rights. Women are key drivers in our efforts to ensure sustainable development and end poverty. Denmark will have the honour of hosting the Women Deliver Conference in May of next year, and I hope that many of those here will join us in Copenhagen. Denmark is also engaged in the global fight against torture, and we are proud to be part of the Convention against Torture Initiative, whose goal is universal ratification and better implementation of the Convention by 2024. We call on all States to join with us in working for that goal.
To put it clearly, Denmark is entirely committed to upholding the core values of the United Nations. That is why we have decided to run for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the period from 2019 to 2021. Our candidacy enjoys the support of all the Nordic countries, and I hope all here today will find us worthy of their vote. I can assure them that we will aspire to be a strong partner for all in advancing human rights and fundamental freedoms.
The third and final major challenge for the United Nations is implementing the development agenda and effectively addressing climate change. This weekend, I had the privilege and honour of co-chairing the Sustainable Development Summit. We have adopted the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), and now we need to act, through national policies and by supporting the countries that need the most help. The Sustainable Development Goals carry a multi-trillion-dollar price tag, and that cannot be met by Governments or aid alone. We need the support of all actors — private enterprises, civil society, non-governmental and international organizations and many others. We must find new and innovative ways of engaging these actors if we are serious about delivering on the development agenda.
That is particularly true when it comes to addressing climate change. To give a small example, Denmark has established a climate investment fund to promote private investments in developing countries and emerging markets. Danish pension savings now contribute to financing Africa’s largest wind farm, in Lake Turkana in Kenya. We need more such solutions if we are to deliver on the development agenda and reach an ambitious, binding climate agreement in Paris later this year.
The need for an effective United Nations has never been greater. If we fail to deal with the enormous tasks facing us, there is a risk that we will undermine the key values and principles of the Charter. Throughout the history of the United Nations, Denmark has been one of the strongest supporters of our world Organization, and that will not change. I am honoured that a Dane has assumed the presidency of the General Assembly, and my Government is fully committed to supporting Mr. Lykketoft in his important work.
Seventy years ago our grandparents had a bold vision. They believed it was possible to create a better future for the peoples of the world. The achievements during those 70 years have been remarkable. This anniversary is a historic opportunity to set ambitious goals for the future. We have agreed on a new development agenda. Now we must act to show our grandchildren that we are able to deliver on our promises today, tomorrow and 70 years from now."
70,2015,RUS,"The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations is a good opportunity both to consider our history and to talk about our collective future. In 1945, the countries that had defeated Nazism united their efforts to lay firm foundations for the post-war world order. I should point out here that the key decisions about the principles for guiding cooperation among States and the creation of the United Nations were made in our country, at the meeting in Yalta of the leaders of the coalition against Hitler. The Yalta system emerged out of genuine travail, paid for with tens of millions of lives and the two world wars that engulfed the world in the twentieth century. And in all fairness to it, it has helped humankind traverse the turbulent and sometimes dramatic events of the past seven decades and has spared the world major cataclysms.
The United Nations is an Organization unique in its legitimacy, representativeness and universality. True, it has recently been much criticized for its perceived insufficient effectiveness and for decision-making on fundamental issues that can be stymied by insuperable differences, particularly among members of the Security Council. I would like to point out, however, that over the 70 years of the existence of the United Nations there have always been disagreements, and the right to the veto has always been exercised — by the United States, Great Britain, France, China, the Soviet Union and later Russia, alike. That is entirely natural for such a diverse and representative Organization. When the United Nations was established, there was

no suggestion that unanimity would reign. Indeed, the essence of the Organization consists in seeking and reaching compromise. Its strength lies in taking account of different opinions and points of view. The decisions that are discussed in the United Nations are either adopted as resolutions or they are not. As the diplomats say, they either go through or do not go through. Any action on the part of any State that bypasses that procedure is illegitimate and runs counter to the Charter of the United Nations and in defiance of international law.
We all know that a single dominating power centre emerged in the world after the end of the Cold War. Those who found themselves at the top of that pyramid were tempted to think that if they were so strong and exceptional, they knew better than anyone else what should be done. As a consequence, they thought, why should they bother with the United Nations, which instead of automatically sanctioning and legitimizing necessary decisions frequently just stands in the way or, as we say, gets underfoot? It has become commonplace to say that the Organization, as originally conceived, has become obsolete and that its historical mission has been accomplished.
The world is changing, of course, and the United Nations must keep up with that natural transformation. Russia is ready to work on that, based on a broad consensus with all its partners, but we consider efforts to undermine the authority and legitimacy of the United Nations to be extremely dangerous. They could lead to the collapse of the entire architecture of international relations. Then we would indeed be left with no rules beyond might is right. That would be a world ruled by selfishness rather than collective effort; a world ever more dictatorial and less about equality, genuine democracy and freedom; a world where an ever-growing number of de facto protectorates and externally controlled territories would replace truly independent States.
What, after all, is State sovereignty, about which some of our colleagues have already spoken? More than anything it is about freedom — the freedom of every person, people or State to choose their own destiny. And by the way, the issue of the so-called legitimacy of State power also falls into this category. We should never play with words or manipulate them. Every term of international law and international affairs should be clear and transparent and possess uniformly understood criteria.
We are all different, and we should respect that. Nobody is obliged to conform once and for all to a single model of development that someone has deemed to be the only right one. We should all remember what we have learned from past experience. For example, we remember instances from the history of the Soviet Union. Attempts to export social experiments and to push for change in one country or another based on our own ideological positions often led to tragic consequences and to deterioration rather than progress.
It seems, however, that no one learns from others’ mistakes. They just repeat them, and the export of revolutions, this time so-called democratic revolutions, continues. We have only to look at the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, which the speaker before me discussed. Certainly, the political and social problems of the region have been brewing for a long time, and people there naturally wanted change.
But how has it actually turned out? Instead of reforming Government institutions, aggressive foreign interference has resulted in the abrupt destruction of the very fabric of life. Instead of the triumph of democracy and progress we got violence, poverty and social catastrophe. And human rights, including the right to life, are simply ignored. One cannot help wanting to ask those who created this situation if they at least realize now what they have done. But I am afraid the question would go unanswered, because policies based on complacency and a belief in one’s exceptionality and impunity are never abandoned.
It is now obvious that the power vacuum that has appeared in a number of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa has led to the emergence of areas of anarchy that immediately began to fill with extremists and terrorists. Tens of thousands of militants are now fighting under the banners of the so-called Islamic State. They include former Iraqi servicemen who were thrown out into the street in the wake of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Another supplier of recruits is Libya, whose statehood was destroyed as a result of a gross violation of Security Council resolution 1973 (2011). And now members of the so-called moderate Syrian opposition, supported by the West, are joining the radical ranks. First they arm and train them, and now they are defecting to the so-called Islamic State. Indeed, the Islamic State itself did not come from nowhere. It, too, was initially forged as a tool against undesirable secular regimes. Having established a foothold in Syria and Iraq, the Islamic State is actively expanding into
other regions, with the aim of dominating the Islamic world, and not just there. It is clearly not limiting itself to those plans alone.
The situation is more than dangerous. In such circumstances, it is hypocritical and irresponsible to make loud declarations about the threat of international terrorism while turning a blind eye to the channels that are financing and supporting terrorists, including through the proceeds of drug trafficking and illicit trading in oil and arms, or to attempt to manipulate extremist groups and make them do one’s bidding in order to achieve one’s own political goals, in the hope of dealing with them — or, to put it more simply, liquidating them — later. What I have to say to those people is this: Sirs, while you are certainly dealing with cruel people, they are in no way stupid or primitive. They are just as smart as you, and you cannot yet tell who is using whom for his own ends. The recent information on the transfer of arms to the terrorists by that moderate opposition itself is the best proof of that.
We believe that any attempt to flirt with terrorists, let alone arm them, is not just short-sighted; it is incendiary. It could result in a dramatic increase in the global terrorist threat and its critical spread to new regions, especially considering the fact that militants from many countries, including Europe, are passing through Islamic State training camps. Nor, unfortunately, I must admit frankly to my colleagues, is Russia an exception. We cannot allow such criminals, who have already smelled blood, to return home and continue their evil deeds there. We do not want that. And after all, would anyone want that?
Russia has always been firm and consistent in opposing terrorism in all its forms. Today we are providing military and technical assistance to Iraq, Syria and other countries of the region that are fighting terrorist groups. We think it is an enormous mistake to refuse to cooperate with the Syrian authorities and the State armed forces, who are valiantly combating terrorism face to face. Finally, we should acknowledge that no one except President Al-Assad’s Government armed forces and the Kurdish militia is truly fighting the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria. We are aware of all the problems and contradictions in the region, but we must nonetheless be realistic.
I feel obliged to point out that Russia’s honest and straightforward approach has recently been used as a pretext for accusing us of harbouring increasing ambitions — as if the people saying that have no
ambitions at all themselves. But the real issue is not Russia’s ambitions but the fact that we can no longer tolerate the current state of affairs in the world. In reality, we are proposing that we should be guided by our shared values and interests rather than ambitions. We should unite our efforts to address, on the basis of international law, these new problems we face and create a genuinely broad international coalition against terrorism. Like the coalition against Hitler, it could unite all the diverse forces willing to resolutely resist those who, like the Nazis, sow evil and hatred of humankind.
And, naturally, Muslim countries should play a key role in that coalition. Not only is the Islamic State a direct threat to them, it also desecrates one of the world’s greatest religions with its bloody crimes. The militants’ ideologists make a mockery of Islam and pervert its true humanistic values. In that regard, I would also like to address Muslim spiritual leaders. Their authority and tutelage are vital at this moment. It is essential to prevent those whom militants try to recruit from making hasty decisions. And those who have been deceived and who by force of circumstance have ended up in the terrorists’ ranks must be helped to find a path back to normal life, lay down their arms and cease their fratricide.
In the next few days Russia, as the current President of the Security Council, will convene a ministerial-level meeting aimed at conducting a comprehensive analysis of threats in the Middle East. First, we propose to discuss the possibility of agreeing on a draft resolution designed to coordinate the actions of all the forces confronting the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Once again, that coordination should be based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
We believe that the international community can develop a comprehensive strategy for the political stabilization and social and economic recovery of the Middle East. Then there would be no need to build camps for refugees. The flood of people forced to leave their homelands has literally engulfed first the country’s neighbours and now Europe. Now they number in the hundreds of thousands, but they could soon be millions. This is a great and tragic new migration of peoples, and a harsh lesson for all of us, including Europe.
I would like to stress that the refugees unquestionably need our compassion and support. However, any fundamental solution to the problem must involve restoring statehood where it has been
destroyed, strengthening Government institutions where they still exist or are being re-established, and providing comprehensive military, economic and material assistance to countries in difficulties — and, of course, to those who have not abandoned their homes despite all their ordeals. Naturally, any assistance to sovereign States can and must be offered rather than imposed, and only in accordance with the United Nations Charter. In other words, everything being done or to be done in this area in accordance with the norms of international law must be backed by our universal Organization, and anything contravening the Charter must be rejected. More than anything, I believe it is vital to help restore Government institutions in Libya, support the new Government of Iraq and provide comprehensive assistance to the legitimate Government of Syria.
Ensuring peace and regional and global stability remains the key task of the international community, with the United Nations at its helm. In our view, that means creating a space of equal and indivisible security that is not for the select few, but for everyone. Yes, it is a complex, difficult and time-consuming task, but there are no alternatives to it. However, for some of our colleagues the Cold War bloc mindset and desire to assimilate new geopolitical areas are still paramount. They began by continuing to expand NATO — and one wonders why, with the Warsaw Pact bloc no longer in existence and the Soviet Union broken up. And yet NATO is not only still there; like its military infrastructure, it is still expanding. Then they offered post-Soviet countries a false choice — to be either with the West or the East. Sooner or later, that logic of confrontation was bound to turn into a serious geopolitical crisis, and that is what happened in Ukraine, where the people’s dissatisfaction with the authorities was exploited and a military coup provoked from outside. A civil war erupted as a result.
We firmly believe that we can end the bloodshed and find a way out of this deadlock only through full implementation, in good faith, of the Minsk agreements of 12 February. Ukraine’s territorial integrity cannot be ensured by threats and force of arms, but it must be done. What is needed is respect for the choice of the people of the Donbas region, genuine consideration of their interests and rights and their engagement in devising the key elements of the country’s political structure, in line with the Minsk agreements that will guarantee that Ukraine can develop as a civilized State and an essential link in the construction of a common
area of security and economic cooperation in both Europe and Eurasia.
I have a reason for speaking of a common area for economic cooperation. Only recently, it seemed that in the economic sphere, where the objective laws of the market apply, we would learn to live without dividing lines and to act on the basis of transparent rules, jointly devised, including the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which stand for freedom of trade and investment and open competition. Today, however, unilateral sanctions that circumvent the United Nations Charter have almost become the norm. They not only serve political aims, they act as a way of pushing competitors out of the market.
I would like to note another sign of growing economic selfishness. A number of countries have chosen to create closed, exclusive economic associations, with negotiations conducted behind closed doors and in secret, undisclosed to their own citizens and business communities. Nor do they inform other countries and Governments whose interests may be affected. Perhaps they want all of us to be left with the fait accompli that the rules of the game have been changed in favour of a small group, and without the participation of the WTO. That could completely unbalance the trade system and lead to the disintegration of the global economic environment. These issues affect the interests of all States and influence the future of the entire world economy. That is why we propose discussing them within the United Nations, the WTO and the Group of 20.
In opposition to a policy of exclusiveness, Russia proposes harmonizing regional economic projects through what is known as the integration of integrations, based on the universal and transparent rules of international trade. One example is our plan to link the Eurasian Economic Union with China’s initiative in creating a Silk Road economic belt. And we continue to believe the possibility of harmonizing integration processes within the Eurasian Economic Union and the European Union to be very promising.
Among the issues affecting the future of all humankind is the challenge of global climate change. It is in our interests to ensure that we get results at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Paris in December. As part of our national contribution, by 2030 we plan to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to between 70 and 75 per cent of their 1990 levels. I
suggest, however, that we should take a broader view of this issue. By establishing quotas on harmful emissions or taking other steps that by their very nature are still only tactical, we may mitigate the problem for a certain amount of time, but fundamentally we will not solve it.
We need a completely different approach. We should be focusing on introducing fundamentally new technologies, inspired by nature, that rather than damaging the environment will be in harmony with it and will enable us to restore the balance between the biosphere and the technosphere that human activities have destroyed. It is indeed a challenge on a planetary scale, but I am confident that humankind has the intellectual wherewithal to respond to it. We must unite our efforts, most of all those States possessing solid research capacities and fundamental scientific achievements. We propose convening a special forum under United Nations auspices for a comprehensive consideration of the issues related to the depletion of natural resources, the destruction of habitats and climate change. Russia is ready to be one of the organizers of such a forum.
On 10 January 1946, the General Assembly of the United Nations gathered in London to begin work on its first session. Eduardo Zuleta Ángel, a Colombian diplomat and the Chairman of the Preparatory Commission, opened the session by giving what I believe was a concise definition of the basic principles by which the United Nations should be guided in its activities. They are free will, disdain for scheming and trickery, and a spirit of cooperation. Today his words can be a guide for us all. Russia believes in the huge potential of the United Nations to help us avoid a new global confrontation and engage in strategic cooperation. We will work consistently with other countries to strengthen the central coordinating role of the United Nations. I am confident that together we can make the world a stable and safe place and ensure conditions conducive to the development of every State and nation."
70,2015,COD,"As I address the Assembly from this rostrum on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila, President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, whom I have the honour and privilege of representing, I should like at the outset to join earlier speakers in congratulating Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. His experience as President of the National Assembly, Foreign Minister and Finance Minister of Denmark, as well as his skills in development issues, are major assets for the success of his mandate. I would also like to commend his predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, Foreign Minister of the Republic of Uganda, on his excellent work as President of the General Assembly at its sixty- ninth session at a historic moment of our Organization. Lastly, I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts to defend and promote the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
Seventy years after its creation, the objectives and principles of our universal and increasingly indispensable Organization are more relevant than ever. Peace and development are indeed the perennial and common desires of all peoples. The core of our collective action as a community of nations will essentially and necessarily continue to be maintaining international peace and security, ensuring justice, upholding human rights and promoting social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. Those objectives of our Organization are complementary and reciprocal.
Without peace, no human rights can endure, whether civil and political rights or economic, social and cultural rights. The systematic denial or constant violation of such rights will inevitably lead to a breakdown of peace and social cohesion and to latent or open crises. Likewise, without peace, development
10/26 15-29876

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24
is hypothetical and the satisfaction of the vital needs of the populations is problematic. On the other hand, underdevelopment and the poverty and insecurity that accompany it are fertile grounds for social demands that often result in violence that is directly proportional to the perceived suffering.
Moreover, in a perpetually changing world in which issues involving security, development and basic human rights know no frontiers, all our fates are interrelated. Solidarity of action and synergy of efforts are not mere options, but rather sine qua non conditions for survival and success.
The reform of our Organization, particularly reform of the Security Council, is another sine qua non condition for our collective effectiveness. Security Council reform must mean expanding its membership and improving its collective representation, while ensuring that the continent of Africa, so far marginalized, is incorporated neither too slowly nor too fast. We cannot sacrifice justice and fairness for speed. The Democratic Republic of the Congo would also like to reaffirm its support for intergovernmental negotiations and would like the integrity of this process to be maintained. It would also like to reaffirm its wholehearted support for the Ezulwini Consensus, which provides the only reasonable basis for remedying the injustice done to Africa and settling the question of its representation.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo believes that armed conflicts, civil wars and all the acts of cruelty and destruction committed by terrorist groups, which perpetuate suffering and misery and create profound tension in the world, must be condemned, regardless of the perpetrators, places, goals or motivations. Today, terrorism is one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. One of the priorities of our Organization must be to fight this scourge, and each of our States must support and participate in the global counter-terrorism strategy. To remain passive against the rise of radicalism and extremism in their most barbaric and murderous forms would be no more nor less than to condone the dehumanization of the world.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a peace-loving country whose history has taught it the inestimable value of peace. It is working tirelessly to preserve peace and stability within its borders, in the Great Lakes region of Africa and in the world. To that end, on 28 February 2013 in Addis Ababa, it signed the
first Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region. It is resolved to keep all the commitments it made by this signature and we call on the other signatory States to do likewise.
It is also in that context that, although at a prohibitively high cost, given our country’s limited resources, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been leading successful operations against hostile forces and armed groups, which over the past 15 years have spread death and destruction in the eastern part of its territory. To that same end, it has also dispatched its own sons and daughters as soldiers and police officers to serve under the flag of the United Nations throughout the world.
It also feels challenged, as does the rest of humankind, by the current migration crisis, which demonstrates — as if a demonstration were needed — the precariousness of the human condition.
While the efforts undertaken by others to overcome that crisis are welcome, it is important, necessary and urgent to attack the root causes, which include the denial of human rights, underdevelopment, poverty, armed conflicts, and natural disasters, some of which have been caused by climate change.
Moved by this need, the Democratic Republic of the Congo participated in the drafting and adoption of the new post-2015 development agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (see resolution 70/1). That agenda embodies every hope for the peoples of the world. Our collective duty is to do everything possible to make it a reality. Impelled by the same need to take action, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been actively involved in preparations for the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December, as well as in relevant international negotiations.
We are all striving for development that is economically efficient, socially equitable and ecologically sustainable. The realization of those aspirations requires action and firm commitments from all of us. In that respect, we all subscribed to the Millennium Development Goals. However, their full and complete implementation has been hampered by numerous issues that we need to resolve promptly, as well as by many challenges that must be urgently
15-29876 11/26

A/70/PV.24 01/10/2015
addressed, especially those regarding the environment. In that respect, we can no longer hesitate.
Climate change is one of the major challenges that our planet faces today. Its negative impact on vital socioeconomic sectors such as agriculture and health is more apparent than ever. The same can be said of its effect on the availability of resources that are necessary to life, such as water. It is urgent that we conclude a universal and legally binding agreement that holds the increase in global average temperature to below 2°C in relation to pre-industrial levels. Let us all demonstrate our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular to the targets involving environmental protection, by making the December session of the Conference of the Parties our deadline.
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we are committed to making responsible sacrifices without jeopardizing our development. To that end, we have developed and submitted an intended nationally determined contribution. It includes both mitigation measures, focusing on four main priority sectors — agriculture, forests, energy, and transportation — and adaptation measures, which in addition to those four sectors also concern the protection of the coast. All of that will result in a 17 per cent rate of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions — the equivalent of 77 million tons of carbon dioxide — by 2030.
We have established the same timetable in our country for a comprehensive and ambitious development programme known as the revolution of modernity. In turn, we hope that the international community will reward our efforts accordingly within the REDD+ process.
Having given our position on some of today’s burning issues, I would now like to talk briefly about the situation in my country. Allow me to talk about the Democratic Republic of the Congo today, a country that has certainly seen difficult times and could have very well disappeared from the map, if it had not been for the United Nations support and, especially, had it not been for the sacrifices made by a people determined to maintain, against all odds, the sovereignty of the country and the integrity of its territory.
I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the gestures of international solidarity that we have benefited from and that have come from other States Members of our Organization, in particular from
the contributors of troops to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I pay tribute to the heroism of our defence and security forces and of our population, who represent a mix of every age and background.
Owing to the concerted efforts of all concerned, we can affirm, without fear of contradiction, that despite the persistence of a few residual areas of unrest, which we are actively trying to quell, peace, security and State authority have been restored to almost the entirety of our national territory. In conjunction with important structural reforms, the restoration of peace and security has fostered the resumption of large-scale economic activities. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is today one of the fastest-growing economies of Africa, with an annual growth rate, from 2010 to 2014, consistently higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. In 2014, the growth rate stood at 9.5 per cent, the third fastest such rate in the world. For nearly three years, we have had an inflation rate of less than 1 per cent and a remarkable level of stability in the exchange rates of our national currency. Furthermore, governance and the business environment have continued to undergo such significant improvements that the Democratic Republic of the Congo was ranked among the top 10 reform-oriented countries in the “Doing Business” classification of the World Bank in 2013.
However, we continue to face major challenges on the path ahead. We are well aware of that, because we know that we are a post-conflict country. Institutional stabilization efforts, security planning and the reconstruction of basic infrastructure must and will continue, with the aim of overcoming poverty, injustice and social inequalities.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo today is a large building site and abounds in business opportunities. It is a country full of potential and, in order to fulfil that potential, is open to the possibility of partnerships of every type, provided that they respect its sovereignty, do not harm its vital interests and are mutually beneficial. In that regard, several sectors of commercial activity that had been limited to the public sector have been opened to competition. Accordingly, new laws are either in the process of being adopted or have already been adopted to liberalize the electricity and insurance sectors, to promote public- private partnerships in the fields of agriculture and infrastructure and to attract and retain domestic and foreign investors.

The obligation that now lies with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and with all partners truly concerned about the welfare of the Congolese people, is that of ensuring the consolidation of all those achievements. Maintaining peace and stability and making our democratic achievements and economic and social progress irreversible are therefore our top priorities. That is why we attach great value to the process of decentralization under way, which has recently been accelerated with the establishment of provincial assemblies in the 21 new provinces and the imminent arrival of provincial executives in those provinces.
Similarly, and in accordance with the electoral timetable published by the Independent National Electoral Commission, the Democratic Republic of Congo is preparing its general election, the third after those of 2006 and 2011. This election, scheduled for the 2015-2016 cycle, confirms a definitive break with the spiral of violence and instability that has characterized our country in recent decades and ushers in a lasting era of democracy for the Congolese people.
Despite the many financial and logistical constraints complicating the electoral process, everything necessary for the holding of transparent and credible elections in a peaceful climate has been put in place by the Independent National Electoral Commission, with the support of the Government and under the direction of the Head of State. To this end, convinced that dialogue is a central principle of democracy and a powerful factor in social cohesion, the Head of State has held consultations since last May with all segments of Congolese society — political actors, civil society, religious and traditional authorities — with a view to supporting a national dialogue.
Finally, after the defeat of the Mouvement du 23 mars and the surrender of several rebel groups, the Democratic Republic of the Congo wishes to consolidate the new-found peace and return to normal life. Accordingly, while we remain sincerely grateful to the United Nations for its contribution to the restoration of that peace, we believe it is high time to reconsider the question of a United Nations presence on Congolese territory and to think about a gradual but major withdrawal of the troops of the Stabilization Mission from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Our country expects to receive the Assembly’s support for this responsible and legitimate request of a Member State, which it makes in full exercise of its sovereignty. It is a request that already has the support of the regional economic communities to which we belong, the Southern African Development Community and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, as well as the African Union. We fully expect that the ongoing strategic dialogue with the Secretary- General and his experts will lead to a recommendation to the Security Council to this effect.
"
70,2015,FJI,"I would like to add my congratulations to the President on his election to those of the leaders who have spoken before me. I wish him success in guiding the General Assembly at its seventieth session to a productive and meaningful conclusion. I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa for his outstanding leadership during the sixty-ninth session.

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
Last year, I addressed the Assembly on the heels of an election victory in Fiji (see A/69/PV.15). I said that Fiji was now a fairer, more just and more compassionate society, and that we would accelerate our efforts to alleviate poverty, thanks to a rapidly strengthening economy. Today I am proud to assure the Assembly that our democracy is working, our economy is growing and we are gradually lifting more people out of poverty every day. This is not an experiment. It is a very real and revolutionary change in the way we Fijians govern ourselves and treat one another.
I will not say that it has been easy, because it has not. But we have had one year of the give-and-take of parliamentary democracy based on a common and equal citizenry, under a Constitution that values every Fijian equally, regardless of ethnicity, birthright, faith, gender, social condition or geography. That is a first. In the past, we had elections; today, we have elections that do not result in the tyranny of the majority. Things have been raucous at times, as we have battled over ideas and exchanged accusations on the floor of Parliament, in the media and before the public. Democracy sometimes seems messy, chaotic and prone to petty squabbles, but it is a price that we Fijians gladly pay for the chance to enjoy its many blessings.
As is natural, our society is now also more compassionate and our economy more robust. We have carried out wide-ranging social and economic reforms designed to free the energies of our people, encourage investment, create employment and lift up the poor and marginalized in Fiji. We have introduced free schooling at the primary and secondary level for the first time and made great efforts to bring the benefits of Government programmes, technology and the modern market to people in remote and underserved areas of the country. Infrastructure development, including roads, electricity, water and health care, is our priority.
The results have been encouraging. Our economy has grown at more than 4 per cent per annum for the past three years, and the rate for 2014 was more than 5.3 per cent. National and international economic experts expect us to meet or exceed that figure this year. Investment, particularly domestic investment, is booming. Construction is up, tourism is up, we have a healthy surplus in foreign exchange reserves and job openings have increased substantially, showing that Fijians are confident. They believe in themselves, in their democracy and in their country’s future. This is the most sustained period of economic growth in our
history, and it is part of a revolution of initiative and energy directly linked to our new democracy.
Dedication to basic human rights is the foundation of democracy. No democracy can survive if each individual’s rights are not sacred and if the State fails to protect, or even works to undermine, the ability of all to think and believe and worship as they choose. No democracy can survive if elections only mean that the winners take all. No democracy can survive if it does not enshrine human dignity as a right and make every effort to assure the people’s socioeconomic rights, as our Constitution provides for.
We have made believers out of people who once doubted and criticized us. We have overcome sanctions and isolation, imposed by other democratic nations in the mistaken belief that they would push us to democracy. In fact, we needed no push. We were already committed to that path. What we needed was engagement and support, and I am pleased to say that we have it again, at last. It is clear that we have fashioned our own democracy on dedication to the rights and dignity of each person in Fiji, and we bring that dedication to our work at the United Nations.
Since Fiji established its Mission in Geneva last year, my Government has worked energetically with the human rights community. Earlier this year, I addressed the Human Rights Council in Geneva, outlining Fiji’s human rights priorities, particularly as they relate to our progressive bill of rights in the 2013 Fijian Constitution. Fijians now enjoy an unprecedented level of protection, enforced through an independent judiciary and a human rights and anti-discrimination commission. I have invited a number of special mandate holders under the Human Rights Council to visit Fiji. I am pleased that the Special Rapporteur on the right to education will visit Fiji within a year to assess and support my Government’s efforts and initiatives to strengthen the right to education. Fiji has also committed to ratifying the core human rights instruments in the not so distant future. That is a solemn commitment that flows naturally from our basic belief that all Fijians have the right to live with dignity. We understand that this will carry additional obligations towards our own people, obligations we are eager to take on.
As we participate in the Human Rights Council, we find, yet again, that the voice and the unique concerns of the Pacific small island developing States have trouble being heard. We have a unique perspective
44/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
of the world to share with the international human rights community. That includes calling attention to the detrimental effect that climate change is having on our ability to extend and strengthen human rights in the region. It also includes educating others about the challenges many of us face in creating proper institutions and changing long-held cultural attitudes that can be obstacles to full respect for human rights. Those are issues that Fiji will continue to raise now, and as a member of the Human Rights Council for the term 2018-2020, if we are elected.
Like our neighbours in the South Pacific and other small island developing States, we see the bright future we have charted for ourselves dimmed by the prospect of climate change and sea-level rise. Fiji has been outspoken in insisting that all nations carry out their duty to reduce carbon emissions and control the production of greenhouse gases. Fiji is making strenuous efforts to do its part, but our part in creating the crisis is very small, practically negligible. The major developed nations and — I must say it — the major developing nations as well, must do more. It is simply not acceptable for advanced economies to build a high standard of living by degrading the Earth and the seas. It is also not acceptable for major nations that are industrialising to assert that they need to degrade the Earth, the air and the seas in order to build their economies, just as the advanced countries did years ago. The emergency is now. The solution must be now. The time for excuses is over.
Earlier this month, the Pacific leaders at the third Summit of the Pacific Island Development Forum adopted the Suva Declaration on Climate Change. This landmark declaration clearly sets out the agreed demands of the Pacific island developing States for an acceptable outcome at the United Nations Climate Conference in Paris later this year. The Suva Declaration calls for the 2015 climate change agreement to limit global average temperature increase to less than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It calls for the Paris agreement to be legally binding on all parties, and for it to recognize loss and damage as a stand-alone element. We also call for climate change adaptation measures to be 100 per cent grant-financed.
The choices we face may be politically difficult in the short run, but the consequences we are already seeing — environmental degradation, unbearable heat, drought, powerful tropical storms and unpredictable weather patterns — are simply unacceptable. We are
elected as leaders, and leaders must be able to explain these consequences to their people and convince them to make the necessary short-term sacrifices for everyone’s benefit. These consequences are real for Fiji and its neighbours. We have plans to move 45 villages to higher ground, and we have already started. We have committed to resettling people from other low- lying South Pacific island States who face the prospect of being swallowed up by the rising ocean and falling inexorably into oblivion. Should that happen, the people of those island States would be refugees, as desperate and lost as the hundreds of thousands fleeing conflict in Syria and Iraq. It is very real and it is happening now. It is time to shed our indifference.
Fiji particularly welcomes the establishment of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on the conservation and sustainable management of oceans and seas. Our destiny is shaped by the ocean in which we are set. But we also welcome this Goal as citizens of the Earth, because the health of the oceans and seas is vital for everyone. In the Pacific Ocean, for too long now, we have observed the decline in our ocean’s health, as evidenced by dying coral, marine pollution, damaged coastal ecosystems, declining fish stocks, and ocean acidification. Those of us who are old enough to remember our ocean in much healthier times must do more than lament that our grandchildren may never see the ocean as it was created. We must do all we can to make sure that they know the ocean as it was when our forbearers bequeathed it to us.
As a founding member of the United Nations group of friends of oceans and seas, Fiji has been working to establish a high-level global platform to ensure that we meet SDG14. I am proud to say that we have found a strong ally in the Government of Sweden to establish the triennial United Nations conference on oceans and seas, with five international conferences spanning the 15 years of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. They will be conferences for action, not talk. Governments, international organizations, scientists, business leaders and others will gather at the five conferences to assess progress and hold all participants accountable for meeting targets. We will host the triennial conference in Fiji in June 2017, and all those dedicated to the integrity of implementation of the oceans Goal will be welcome.
We Fijians do not ask others to do what we are unwilling to do. We are a nation that stands up. We stand up for peace. We stand up for our neighbours.
15-29562 45/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
And we stand up for the environment. We held our first national green growth summit in Fiji only a couple of months before I appeared before the Assembly last year. In that short time, Fiji developed and has begun implementing its own green growth framework — a master plan for an economic model that is more holistic, integrated, inclusive and, above all, sustainable. Our framework links economic growth and environmental protection and builds an economy that grows in a more intelligent way and nurtures the interests of all our citizens. No project will proceed if it is not sustainable, or if it jeopardizes our natural resources in any way. We hold our resources in trust for future generations, and we will not squander them for short-term economic gain. We will continue to grow, develop and modernize, but we will embrace a future in which our forests, our mangroves, our coral reefs and our marine life thrive. If everyone does the same with their part of the world, large or small, we may have a chance to save this planet.
I believe that Fiji’s commitment to the United Nations as an institution and to the work of the United Nations is second to none. Our contributions to worldwide peacekeeping are a matter of national pride, honour and commitment. Today, Fijian military, police and correctional officers are actively engaged in United Nations peacekeeping missions in Iraq, the Golan Heights, Lebanon, Darfur and South Sudan, as well as in the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai. We are also proud to now be serving in the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, headquartered in Jerusalem.
This national mission of ours — to work with other nations to bring peace to the world — has become a part of our national identity. It involves great sacrifice on the part of many Fijian families and, of course, it is dangerous work that has resulted in the tragic loss of life. But I bring to the General Assembly today the solemn will of the Fijian people to continue to serve the cause of peace through the United Nations wherever the Organization is called on to heal the wounds of strife and war.
Fiji has been a Member of the United Nations since its independence, in October 1970. Since that time Fiji’s leaders have attended the General Assembly every year to play our part in this great global gathering. Every year we have been wisely guided by a President of the General Assembly hailing from one of our fellow Member States, but never by a President from the Pacific Islands developing States. We believe the time has
come for the Pacific Islands to provide the Assembly’s President, and we have put forward a candidate for the Assembly’s seventy-first session. Our candidate, duly submitted to the Asia-Pacific Group, is currently Fiji’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Peter Thomson. He is a seasoned diplomat who has demonstrated extraordinary leadership in service to the United Nations. Fiji looks to the friends of the Pacific Islands at the United Nations to give their support to our candidate for the President of the Assembly at its seventy-first Session.
Fiji is fully committed to the work of the United Nations under President Lykketoft’s stewardship at this seventieth session of the General Assembly. I pledge to him our full support and cooperation as he carries out the responsibilities that lie before him. This body holds the promise of raising human beings out of poverty and degradation to health and hope, from conflict and fear to peace, and from an effort to tame our environment to a commitment to live in harmony with it. Fiji will be with him this year, and we will be with our fellow nations until we realize that promise.
"
70,2015,MYS,"I would like to congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. His experience and wisdom will be an invaluable guide to the Assembly. The theme of this session, “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”, is timely. We urgently need to find new approaches and to rise above the political divisions and put people first in an age when the old ways are proving inadequate to the challenges we face today.
We are a world of nation States, but the new conflicts and threats that imperil our peace and security do not recognize borders. Non-State actors, such as the so-called Islamic State, threaten to destroy sovereign States. They do not confine their acts of horrific cruelty within official boundaries. Experts in social media recruit followers in faraway countries, luring them with false promises and persuading many young people that their barbaric actions will bring them closer to God. That is sickening, and there can be no greater a slur on Islam, which is a religion of peace, moderation and justice.
But those extremists cannot be defeated by traditional military means alone. Five years ago, I stood before the Assembly and called for a global movement of moderates, a movement of all religions, of all countries, to marginalize extremists, to reclaim the centre and reshape the agenda in the direction of peace and pragmatism. We in Malaysia have followed up, both through practical action and by building intellectual capacity. Central to that effort is a reaffirmation of Islam’s true nature, because we must acknowledge that, at the moment, we are not winning the propaganda war against the so-called Islamic State. Its twisted narrative is not being countered in a way adequate to preventing many misguided people from joining or supporting it from afar. So it is more important than ever that we spread awareness about authentic Islam, most especially when conflicts persist and people lose hope. For it is there that extremism finds fertile soil. And those who fight for extremism, for a perversion of true Islam, are among the main drivers of the current migration crisis in the Middle East.
Islam unequivocally prohibits the killing of civilians during war. It explicitly protects minorities and respects those of other faiths. It urges the pursuit of knowledge and stresses both justice and compassion. As the Prophet Muhammad said, you will not enter paradise until you have faith, and you will
not complete your faith until you love one another as you love yourselves. That means that there should be no strife among Muslims, including between Shia and Sunni, who may take different paths but seek the same destination.
Islam condemns the destruction of historical sites that are part of the world’s cultural heritage. The lies of the so-called Islamic State include the claim that it is their duty to destroy historical sites, because the Prophet Muhammad destroyed the idols that had been introduced into the Kaaba in Mecca. That reasoning is based on a false analogy. The Kaaba was built by the prophet Abraham for the worship of the one true God, and later generations added the idols. The Prophet Muhammad was commanded to purify the Kaaba of those idols for its use by his followers and to bring it back to its original form. The historical sites being destroyed by the so-called Islamic State were never used for the worship of the one God and then later desecrated, so the argument for destroying them does not and cannot apply. Moreover, God informs us that the sites that we travel to and that denote past civilizations, some of which were global super-Powers in their time but are that no longer, are signs that remind us not to be arrogant, but to walk the earth humbly. We must combat the so-called Islamic State and its warped ideology by explaining why their path is un-Islamic and why their actions are evil, theologically incoherent and a travesty of Islam, which commands us to be knowledgeable, compassionate and humble.
The Malaysian Government has helped to develop an important body of scholarship that does just that. An international group of Sunni and Shia scholars representing a cross-section of the global Muslim community has been convened in Kuala Lumpur. Its mission is to define an Islamic State, based on the continuity of Islamic religious thought through the past 14 centuries. Such a State is nothing like the entity in Syria and Iraq that usurps that name. The scholars have unanimously emphasized that an Islamic State must deliver justice in all its forms, political, economic and in the courts, to its citizens. It must be based on the objectives of sharia, or maqasid sharia, which are the protection and enhancement of life, religion, intellect, property, family and dignity.
An Islamic State must defend the various peoples under its rule and preserve their religions, languages and historic sites, because God commands us, “Indeed, we have made you nations and tribes, that ye may
32/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
know one another”. God could have created us as one religious community, but in order to test us, He did not do so, and He orders us to compete with each other in being virtuous. A true Islamic State, therefore, aids God’s divine intent to test humankind and urges us to compete in virtue, in knowledge, kindness, compassion and humility, but, crucially, it does not coerce us to do so. Those are Islam’s true principles. The so-called Islamic State knows nothing of Islam’s noble ideals, compassion or solemn duty to care for and learn about our fellow human beings. They are violating divine will. They are desecrating the name of our religion through their self-proclaimed caliphate, to which no true Muslim will pledge allegiance. That is the message that we must spread to Muslims and non-Muslims. And I call on the Umma to rise with one voice and let the world ring when we say to the so-called Islamic State that it does not represent us.
Let no one doubt how seriously Malaysia regards the problem of militants, both those who wish to use Kuala Lumpur as a transit point and those who wish to sow violence and destruction at home. Much of our work on that problem cannot be revealed for security reasons. Some may be led to think that, because Malaysia has not suffered a successful terrorist attack, we do not have national security challenges. That is not the case. Our tireless and ever-vigilant security forces have intercepted many would-be IS recruits transiting through Kuala Lumpur. It is because of our efforts that those recruits have not fallen into the darkness that blights Syria and Iraq. But, unfortunately, some have. We have identified 39 Malaysians who have travelled to join the so-called Islamic State, and we have arrested more than 100 of our citizens suspected of links to the so-called Islamic State.
Those threats are real. There are people who want to bring terror to our streets. We will not stand for it, and they will not succeed, for Malaysia has been and will always be a land where many faiths and ethnicities freely prosper and thrive. But we must strive harder to combat the terrorist threat together. Military and intelligence services need to share information and countries need to collaborate more and dare to pre-emptively arrest as necessary. We have passed legislation to enable that. When the evidence is irrefutable, we will take action unhesitatingly. If our citizens’ lives are threatened by the possible bombing of a mall or a railway station, we would be negligent in our duty if we did not intervene before it was too late.
The year 2015 has given us examples of inspiring new approaches. For instance, the United States restored diplomatic relations with Cuba. That was a historic achievement and an exemplary display of moderation in action. It took courage. It would not have happened had those wishing to cling to old political divisions held sway. Forward-thinking leaders put their people’s interests first.
Similar courage is needed to permanently address the injustice that the Palestinians have suffered since 1948. Decades of impunity and the systematic dehumanization of Palestinians has culminated in increasing violence, illegal settlements and violations of rights. The frustration and anger felt by the Palestinians resonates with Muslims worldwide. If the world continues to turn a blind eye to their suffering, we risk another catastrophe in the occupied Palestinian territory. We will also fail to uphold the right to self- determination, which was one of the founding principles of the United Nations when it was created 70 years ago.
On that note, given the violations of the Al-Aqsa Mosque that took place on Rosh Hashanah in Jerusalem this year and the aggression against its worshippers three weeks ago, I call on the Israeli Government to live up to Judaism’s highest ethical principles and, in particular, to the essential message of the Torah, as succinctly expressed by the sage Hillel of the first century before the Common Era. When asked to describe the Torah in a nutshell, he said, “That which is despicable to you, do not do to your fellow”.
That dictum, known universally in all religions as the Golden Rule, could herald the dawn of a much needed revitalized relationship between Muslims and Jews. Currently Israel is exerting its authority over Islam’s third holiest site, in defiance of the jurisdiction of King Abdullah of Jordan, its lawful custodian. It is, therefore, Israel’s duty to facilitate the visits of Muslims from all over the world. For that is an aspiration held by all devout Muslims that they pray to realize in their lifetime.
Putting people first will not always be easy, but the problems of today require new and global solutions. As a member of the Security Council, Malaysia will continue to raise such issues. Reforming the Security Council so as better to reflect the realities of 2015, rather than those of 1945, represents a good start in building a new and adequately responsive global architecture.

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
We in Malaysia know how much that is needed. We were extremely disappointed that the proposed Council resolution to set up an international tribunal on the matter of the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 was not adopted because the right of veto was used. We will continue to seek justice through other legal options, because we owe it to the families of those who perished in that outrageous crime.
But whether it be reforming the United Nations, combating extremism or dealing with migration, greater mutual effort is necessary. We must look into ourselves and our own traditions to create new mechanisms. We believe that moderation is key. Moderation is not about being weak. On the contrary, it shows courage and strength — the strength to push for peace and put the people first. It is a principle that runs through all civilizations and faiths. Islam embodies it in the concept of wasatiyyah and Confucianism as chung yung. Both translate as the middle path or the golden mean. It is a principle that we must rediscover. At the twenty-sixth Summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Malaysia in April, we reaffirmed our commitment to such an approach, when we adopted the Langkawi Declaration on the Global Movement of Moderates.
Malaysia stands ready to share its experience of upholding Islam and marginalizing extremism; of implementing the objectives of shariah, while practicing democracy; of maintaining a multi-ethnic society, where different faiths coexist and prosper; and of showing that Islam can not only succeed, but also drive progress and successful economic development. As we cooperate to solve the scourges of poverty, hatred, war and human-made and natural disasters, which have given us today’s refugee crises, we must draw from our spiritual traditions that generosity of spirit that goes beyond legal requirements.
The eightieth chapter of the Koran, the surah ‘Abasa, opens with God criticizing the Prophet Muhammad — whom we Muslims regard as God’s Beloved — because he frowned and turned away when one of his followers, a poor blind man, interrupted him to ask a question while he was preaching to a rich and powerful unbeliever. If God promptly rebuked the Prophet Muhammad, how much more do we — especially we the leaders of the Muslim world — stand to be rebuked by our Creator if we frown and turn away from our fellow Muslims, those who are poor and marginalized and are now fleeing Syria in massive numbers, causing social and economic distress
in Europe? Are we not then partially responsible for the ensuing European hostility directed at Islam, the faith we love, and at our fellow Muslims?
On that account, over the years, Malaysia has taken in numerous individuals fleeing war, starvation and persecution. We currently have hundreds of thousands of irregular migrants, and we took in more earlier this year, when there was a dire humanitarian situation in the Andaman Sea. I am pleased to announce today that, in order to help alleviate the current refugee crisis, Malaysia will do its share and open our doors to another 3,000 Syrian migrants over the next three years.
New international solutions are needed to deal with the migration crises. The millions fleeing are people, and they are people like us. They should be of concern to us all. We must respect our common humanity. We must transcend the silos of race and faith. When we look at the images of the desperate migrants, who are the victims of extremists or whose lives are degraded by hunger and poverty, we must see them not as strangers, but as our brothers and sisters.
It is only when we see that dreadful picture of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who was washed ashore, and recognize our own children in that tragic boy’s innocent face that we will act as our better selves. People around the world cry out for our help. We cannot — we must not — pass on by.
"
70,2015,GMB,"First and foremost, I bring greetings and best wishes from His Excellency Sheikh Professor Alhaji Dr. Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh Babil Mansa, President of the Republic of the Gambia, who has also directed me to read out his statement on his behalf, as follows.
“I wish to first and foremost praise the Almighty Allah for granting me this opportunity to once again be part of this 2015 General Assembly with
leaders from around the globe. I also pray to the Almighty Allah to guide us throughout this session and provide us with the necessary wisdom, courage and blessing for the fulfilment of our objectives.
“But before speaking any further, please allow me to first extend my warmest congratulations to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft in his new position as the elected President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and to further wish him all the best in his official endeavours throughout his tenure. The entire Gambian delegation and I are pleased to support his presidency during the course of these deliberations. By being entrusted with such a special responsibility, it is fair to say that the world has, in a position of consensus, identified his exemplary qualities and abilities as the perfect person to oversee the current global agenda for the building of a more caring world free of war ravages and underdevelopment.
 “I also wish, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, to convey my special thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, for his remarkable performance during his tenure in office. We are very proud of him and will continue to wish him the best and give him all our support in his future undertakings.
“Last but not least, I wish to register our special commendation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and members of his entire supporting team who,

despite difficult challenges, continue to perform their duties with notable success.
“There has never been a moment better than this for our Organization collectively to reflect and resolve to respond with a special sense of urgency to the increasing complexities of global challenges that threaten to derail hundreds of years of peace, progress and prosperity for humankind. It is therefore imperative that, as an agent of change, the United Nations not fail to account for and cement the implementation of critical resolutions designed to assist our Member nations and, indeed, the entire universe for the improvement and sustainment of a better quality of life for all.
“In order to effectively achieve the goals set forth by this world body for the stability and maintenance of world peace, all Member States, be they big or small, must be promptly and strongly reprimanded or censured for violations that are in direct conflict with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).
“I remain firm in my constant recommendation for the whole world to stand together against the continued barbarism and brutality of indiscriminate terrorism perpetrated against innocent men, women and children, causing undue suffering and losses that often render the victims helpless, homeless and hopeless. As genuine Muslims worshipping the Almighty Allah, whose message in the Holy Koran repeatedly draws our attention to the need to live together in peace for our common humanity, we the majority must not remain indifferent or silent with respect to those particularly sadistic sons of Satan who are committed to desecrating Islam itself with only one objective and inclination — to wreak havoc on their fellow human beings.
“Let me say again as I have said in this forum and many others elsewhere that the propaganda and propagation of these Satanic ideologies are not only a fraudulent misrepresentation of Islam — a noble religion indeed — and a mockery of democratic ideals, but an insult to the Almighty Allah himself, making it ever more necessary to nullify their existence by all means possible. Their baseless claims and increasing attacks on peaceful regions require the United Nations in particular to come together to exterminate these barbaric monsters, as
they have no regard for the sanctity of human life in the first place.
“Countries that are caught at the crossroads and are embroiled in conflicts with terrorism deserve our unfettered and unmitigated support. I therefore call upon Member nations to fully commit to the Organization’s basic tenets regarding the solidification of enduring solutions that protect and sustain all human life. As true Muslims and Allah- worshipping people, we must understand that these are unconscionable acts that should be subjected to the toughest penalties.
“In recognition of the need for world peace, my Government respects the recent landmark agreement on the Iran nuclear issue, outlined in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in which Iran has agreed — along with the United States of America, Russia, China and Germany — to limit its nuclear programme as specified. My Government believes that it is an important achievement with the right measures, particularly if they are put in place, for monitoring and accountability purposes.
“While we welcome the Iranian agreement to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the need remains to address perennial conflicts with a high human cost to our youth, women and children, and to defuse persistently tense situations with high potential for escalation into a nuclear conflagration. I therefore call upon this global institution and regional organizations charged with the responsibility of conflict resolution, peacekeeping and peacebuilding to firm up our commitment to international peace and security. That is imperative in order to end the dangerously escalating acts of violence, terrorism and banditry in simmering trouble spots the world over.
“The continuation of these conflicts calls into question the efficacy of the United Nations in executing the principal function for which it was first created. Paradoxically, however, their persistence constitutes highly valued gains for some unscrupulous enemies of peace, as the belligerents and opposing factions are supported by States, entities and individuals for geopolitical, economic and military strategic interests based on greed and hatred for the rest of humankind.
“I would also urge that the United Nations address the post-Ebola 2014 virus epidemic, which
2/23 15-29595

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18
claimed and maimed thousands of lives, mostly in the hardest-hit West African subregion. While the sizeable monetary, medical personnel and supply contributions had a huge impact on its containment and treatment, there are invariably vast rippling effects for almost the entire continent. The slow reaction times for response efforts, human fear and media reports have had a wide-scale negative economic impact on a large number of countries. As a result of continued reductions in trade and foreign investment, border closures and flight cancellations, the United Nations Development Group has projected that West Africa stands to lose more than $3.6 billion annually over the next three years. As the virus still poses a threat to the world, there are a number of solutions that the United Nations could support to contain and prevent the disease from re-emerging and spreading.
“Critical among such approaches is the need to invest in awareness campaigns, education and vaccinations to ensure the safety and security of the whole world community. Obviously, we cannot but continue to express our sincere appreciation for the timely and effective intervention of the Cuban Government, the Russian Federation and the United States Government, whose rapid deployment of the necessary logistics, including medical teams, to the worst-affected areas helped immensely in stopping the spread of the disease.
“Despite persisting challenges, Africa and the Gambia continue to make effective gains in achieving many aspects of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals. To begin with, protecting our environment must emphatically remain a major priority for this global body because registered climate changes over the course of history have significantly impacted negatively on our planet Earth and demand our immediate and permanent attention. The planet is, after all, our only home, which we must passionately protect for the benefit of present and future generations.
“That, in essence, demands from all of us the steadfastness to soundly manage our natural resources for both economic and social development. We can no longer continue to pretend not to know or live in denial of the challenges faced by humankind from the adverse impact of the depletion of our natural resources, as manifest today in the form of desertification, drought, land degradation and
ocean acidification though activities of State-owned and multinational companies, mostly from the West and the developed world.
“This body must act with greater commitment and resolve to establish sustainable conservation programmes, with production patterns aimed at effectively combating climate change, restoring our ecosystems, promoting forest management and reversing desertification and land degradation. It is also the obligation of the United Nations to be resilient in ensuring the reduction of the risks of man-made disasters that often cause massive pollution to our seas, oceans and fresh water sources.
“Therefore, my Government continues to reiterate the significance of how Security Council reform bears on the global interests of all Member States and the enduring interests of the Organization as well. As clearly articulated in decision 62/557 adopted by a consensus of Member States, we, the stakeholders, all support the laudable idea that the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform should be driven by Member States themselves and that the positions of Member States should form the foundation of the negotiations in the first instance.
“We are, however, yet to realize a reflection of such principles and consensus in the Council’s general approach and framework document. In order for the Security Council’s multifaceted reform to realize its desired objective of increased efficiency and effective representation in an atmosphere governed by democratic working methods, top priority should be given to increasing the representation of African countries in particular, which will provide us with better opportunities to participate in the Council’s decision-making process.
“We must bear in mind that African nations represent more than 1 billion people in this body and constitute 54 sovereign States here, making it ever more important and more qualified for the allocation of the two permanent and two non-permanent seats that Africa rightly deserves. But our calls have never heeded despite persistent appeals, as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration, among others.

A/70/PV.18 29/09/2015
“It has been 15 years since 2000 and the initial development of the Millennium Development Goals, and, though progress in various degrees has been accomplished among Member States, with broader, more reliable and sustainable goals we must continue to build on proposed motions so as to ensure the real achievement of the goals that we set for ourselves.
“Despite the marked evolution in human diversity, there are some tenets with respect to people’s religious beliefs and values that are sacred and no country, big or small, should be allowed to insult another country or bully it for honouring the traditions that govern its people. To do so is both disrespectful and dangerous. Whereas materialism, terrorism, crime, obsession with weapons of mass destruction, and deviant lifestyles seem to be the order of the day, we must make no mistake that there are still right and wrong deeds, and positive and negative consequences. As much as some behaviours are clearly in violation of laws and societal norms, there are others that are a direct insult to our respective religions. I maintain that all of the aforementioned behaviours are displeasing to the Almighty Allah and against the principles that govern peaceful and loving Muslims and Christians alike.
 “For 70 years since the founding of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has continued to maintain the same language as the mainstay of literally every United Nations resolution and conference that has to do with the family, namely, that the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society. So that spirit has excluded and still should exclude any international acknowledgement of relationships between persons of the same sex to signify a family, as in the case of homosexual civil unions and so-called same-sex marriages. Therefore given the natural structure of human nature and society, we must not allow ourselves to depart from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights norm by entertaining deviant beliefs that reduce the family to Government approval of adult sexual and emotional desires, instead of recognizing them as central agents to achieve the common good of spouses, children and society at large.
“I wish to shift attention to the great continent of Africa, whose human and vast natural resources have always been the target of trespassers who have trampled our economic, social, political, and human rights. Although there has been a steep learning curve with regard to becoming self-sufficient, there has always been and will always persist a desire for Africa to remain forever independent of colonial rule and subjugation.
“In fact, my Government and other States have made an iron-clad promise to our citizens that this is our time and our era. It is time for Africa to reap the benefit of its divine inheritance. It is time for Africa to dispel the myths and falsehoods about its history and people. It is time for Africa to stop people from taking advantage of our glorious and rich natural resources, and to stand up for what it believes in, what it is interested in and what is better for its people. No longer will we as a continent be robbed of our very means to progress and prosperity.
“It is heartbreaking to live with the sad reality that the United Nations cannot gain much traction in arresting the state of incessant violence in the occupied Palestinian territories, which is evident as a result of the continuing policy of settlement expansion and the climate of impunity relating to the activities of the settlers. Although there is an overwhelming increase in the number of areas of conflict in the Middle East, which in many ways has impacted the priorities of the United Nations there, our attention must never be distracted from the suffering of the Palestinian people. Their right to a State with secure borders and East Jerusalem as its capital will not be compromised. This long overdue exigency, which is backed by myriad United Nations resolutions — not least, the recent resolution 66/225, of 29 March 2012 — continues to be my Government’s position on this particular issue.
“The fight against drug and human trafficking should be seen as linked to international security because it is a serious threat to all societies. We know that the use and sale of drugs are deeply rooted in violence and organized crime. We also know that drug trafficking is linked to terrorist activities and other crimes, including money-laundering and the sale and trade of arms. Wide-scale corruption exists within organized groups with pervasive
4/23 15-29595

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18
criminal mindsets. Therefore, the inherent threats of drug trafficking and its related problems require urgent action on the part of this international body.
“At the current rate, drug trafficking is likely to become an epidemic that no country can escape because it is steadily rising to become a borderless threat. I therefore strongly urge that we approach this threat much more aggressively, with a comprehensive plan that involves accountability, full international commitment and support. Moreover, not just tougher laws and penalties are necessary; critical efforts are also vital to containing the spread of the use of drugs, as is the need for adequate rehabilitation measures for enduring solutions.
“I must underscore my Government’s gratitude to the Russian Federation for sponsoring the Moscow-Africa Anti-Drug Dialogue, held in the Gambia on 23 July with the objective of mapping out the best means of approaching the hazard in the African continent and the world over. The meeting was a resounding success, and once again I stand to sincerely extol the special part played by the leaders and Government of Russia for a job well done.
“In conclusion, at the forefront of our agenda we should aggressively discuss how we can cope with the evolution of enduring issues that coexist in our societies, such as trespassers and pillagers on free soil, willing to take what does not rightly belong to them. For centuries, the African continent remained the target of intrusion, theft and enslavement by foreign Powers. Nevertheless, increased terrorism threats, hunger, poverty, crime and disease continue to expand faster than our intelligence, resources and might. Global peace, it would therefore seem, depends on our efforts to take corrective measures against rampant injustice.
“It is with this serious concern in mind that I suggest that, on the basis of the brutality and inhumanity of the slave trade, the lingering influences and effects of colonialism, the pervasive destruction of human capital, and the theft of native African resources that are often rare and existing only on that extraordinarily diverse continent, this Organization should now consider remitting an invoice of reparations to the entire world and made payable to the sovereign Governments of Africa.
“But Members should know that such action alone is not enough to compensate for the untold loss of life, limb, talent and resources that are vital for Africa to become a more developed and sustainable nation. It would, rather, amount to a fairly acceptable gesture of restoration and justice for what Africa cannot reclaim.”
