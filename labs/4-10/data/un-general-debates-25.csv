25,1970,SDN,"126.	 In this anniversary year the General Assembly of the United Nations is indeed fortunate to have Ambassador Hambro, a man of vast knowledge and intellectual dynamism, at its helm. In this anniversary year, marking the lapse of one quarter of a century in the life of the Organization, the United Nations needs more than ever before the critical outlook and the fresh initiative which we so much hope to find and exercise under his able stewardship,
127.	Twenty-five years are but a small parenthesis in the life of a world organization. But the attainment of the age of 25 years, even in the eyes of the most conservative of laws, signifies also the attainment of majority, of adulthood, and of the age of civic and political responsibility.
128.	So let us take this occasion for a candid auto critique. Let us sincerely appraise the past, for it is only through such an honest appraisal that we can brave the challenges of the future. Let us sincerely see whether the United Nations has shown, now that it has come of age, the adult sense of responsibility expected of reasonable adults. In so doing I am not only adducing a personal argument, but also reflecting the outlook of a disenchanted but determined new Sudan; disenchanted because of the failures of the past, and determined, together with her many sisters and friends, to help realize the hopes of the future.
129.	The United Nations was born 25 years ago out of reaction to war and revulsion to its carnage. Its basic constituent document was meant to chart the path for the establishment of a universal society dedicated to the achievement of peace for every nation and liberty for every man. It was meant to mark an end to the international law of the great, based on zones of influence and balance of power, and replace it by an international code of conduct prevailing over inconsistent domestic legislation and design. But 25 years after the promulgation of the Charter the world of the United Nations continues to be ill-mannered and full of vulgar contradictions. Empires still exist and imperial traces linger. The armadas of the great are still patrolling the high seas under the guise of a self-imposed policeman-ship. Their imperial outposts are still studding the globe in the name of the advancement of liberty and civilization, and this, indeed, is reminiscent of something far beyond the world of the 1940s when the United Nations was born. It is reminiscent of the Roman Empire with the only difference, perhaps, that we are made to deal today with emperors and consuls who are lacking in the grace of Augustus and Cato.
130.	It is here that we have to look for the deficiencies of the Organization, and they are legion. The failure of the United Nations does not lie in the Charter, as many people seem to suggest, but in the lack of allegiance to it. It does not lie in the guiding principles of the Organization, but in the subordination by the big Powers of those principles to their short-term national interests. The United Nations, let us face it, is marginal in the foreign policy formulation of the big Powers, and those of them who support it only see in it an adjunct to their national policy and see in its organs an annex to their overseas chanceries. The recent attitude of the United States Government to the International Labor Organization is but the last case in point.
131.	The collective will that was envisaged in San Francisco had emanated from the Allies' joint effort against fascist tyranny. But that was a short honeymoon. That will withered away to be replaced by new pacts and alliances that virtually torpedoed the authority of the world Organization to maintain peace and security. What was left for the United Nations in this field was the marginal role which was so aptly described by Dag Hammarskjold in his introduction to the twelfth annual report to the General Assembly in October 1957  when he spoke of the United Nations as a modest stepping stone to world society, an imperfect but indispensable instrument of nations working for peaceful world order. Where the national interests of power collide, united nations can find a possibility of acting as a buffer, a stabilizer. The greatest need is to blunt the edges of conflict among nations, not to sharpen them.
132.	So the role of the United Nations, in the words of one of its greatest protagonists, has been reduced to this: an anteroom in which contending gladiators can find a breathing space, a conduit for channeling communication between two adversaries who have ceased to be on talking terms, or a dispenser of face saving formula. And in this neoRoman era of mutual terror even the great Powers are often looking for a face-saver.
133.	All of this represents an abdication of international responsibility by the great Powers, and all of this has led to an erosion of faith by the smaller States in the United Nations and its workings. It is a loss of faith that has amounted in some cases to open contempt and disregard.
134.	The last 25 years may have seen the end of war in Europe and North America, but the rest of the world continues to suffer outrageous fortune, suffocation of human rights, usurpation of territory, and the rape of liberty and independence. This is hardly the universal peace that was conceived in San Francisco.The pessimists among us see, in the cynical attitude of some of the great PowciS towards those problems in Africa, Asia and Latin America, a betrayal of a deeper sentiment still envisioning peace as the perpetual peace of Utrecht, a luxury to be enjoyed by the concert of the great in the best tradition of the Abbe Castel de St. Pierre.
135.	To save time and patience I wish to single out of the record two areas of conflict representing today the main sources of international preoccupation; the Middle East and SouthEast Asia.
136.	First, the Middle East; here again the authority and prestige of this Organization is being exposed to a serious challenge that threatens its very effectiveness as an instrument for the maintenance and preservation of international peace and security. We believe that the core of the so-called Middle East question lies in the proper understanding of the essential nature of the Palestinian tragedy.
137.	The question is essentially related to the existence of the Palestinians as a people, and the right of this people to struggle by every means at their disposal to maintain their national identity and exercise their inalienable right to self-determination. The Palestinians are a nation who, in consequence of the joint and persistent collaboration of world imperialism and Zionism, have been physically displaced from their homeland and turned into a scattered nation of refugees living in camps. This is a bitter reality which we have to grasp before we should embark on finding ways and means to solve the problem of the Middle East. The failure of the United Nations in many of its efforts to deal with similar situations is precisely due to its refusal to go into the roots of evil
138.	Only very recently the Lusaka summit conference of nonaligned States, representing more than half of the entire population of the world, reiterated the views expressed by this Assembly in its resolution 2535 (XXIV) of 10 December 1969, and adopted a resolution in which the Conference declared its full respect for the inalienable rights of the Arab People of Palestine in their usurped homeland and reaffirmed its support in their struggle for national liberation and against colonialism and racism, and declared that full respect for the inalienable rights of the Arab People of Palestine was a prerequisite to peace in the Middle East.
139.	As we see it, the Palestinian people have a cause not only recognized by this Assembly, but also by a sizable portion of international public opinion. We know of no freedom-loving people who have withstood humiliation forever, and the Palestinian people are no exception. The heroic struggle waged today by the Palestinian revolutionary movement indicates the degree of the political awakening of a great people who have resorted to arms to face an armed enemy.
140.	On the other hand, Israel still arrogantly insists on the occupation of territories belonging to three States Members of this Organization, thus creating a dangerous situation in the Middle East and constituting a grave threat to world peace.
141.	Various resolutions have been adopted by this Assembly and by the Security Council calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied Arab territories since the June war of 1967. We particularly refer to resolution 242 (1967) adopted by the Security Council on 22 November 1967, providing for the withdrawal of Israeli forces. This resolution still remains unimplemented and will ever remain so as long as the leaders of Israel still boast of their aggression and cherish the dream of reaping its fruits, and so long as they continue to receive the unrelenting support of the United States, both overtly and covertly.
142.	We are firmly convinced that Israel could have never taken this arrogant and defiant attitude had it not been for this continued political, military and economic support accorded to it by the Government of the United States of America. What we expect of a great Power like the United States Government in this conflict is a demonstration of impartiality and a genuine attempt to understand the true nature of the Palestinian people's problem. Without this the desire for establishing a permanent peace in our area will continue to be a remote one.
143.	The concerned Arab countries which have accepted that resolution despite its shortcomings and the unusual circumstances under which it was adopted have displayed a marked degree of moderation and flexibility in their sincere effort to reach an acceptable solution. Contraiy to these countries, Israel has persistently obstructed all endeavors to implement this resolution and sought to exploit its shortcomings to achieve its expansionist goals and impose a settlement on the Arab countries tantamount to surrender. But, as the late President Nasser has said, while the Arabs are ready to knock at all doors that may lead to a just and honorable settlement there is one door that they will never knock at and that is the door of capitulation.
144.	We have been waiting to hear some happy tidings from Tel Aviv reflecting a change of heart and only a few days ago [1851st meeting] the Foreign Minister of Israel came before this Assembly to elaborate on the Middle Eastern problem with wit and word. But his speech, eloquent as it may have been, was replete with inexactitudes and distorted through omissions. He asked us to take as a point of reference for his analysis of the problem what he called the still un-forgot ten drama of 1967. But to us and to all fair-minded people the inception of the drama was not in 1967. The history of the Palestinian tragedy goes back to 1948 and beyond. It goes back to the days of the double dealings of Whitehall in the 1930s and the tragic episodes of the 1940s that ensued from it. It goes back to the days of the stealthy usurpation of land through the connivance of British administration. It goes back to the days of the criminal intimidation of which the assassination of Lord Moyne in Cairo and the blowing up of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem were but examples. It goes back to the days of the willful extermination of the Arabs in their villages of which the massacre of Deir Yassin was just an episode. It goes back to the days of the physical eradication of the more conscientious and vocal against violence of which the slaying of Count Bernadotte was just a sample. That is our point of reference not to the unforgotten drama of 1967, but to the everliving tragedy of Palestine. And because of this, Mr. Eban did not sound as convincing as he professed to be. More deeds and a genuine change of heart are needed before anybody can even dream of seeing the twilight of the peace depicted by the Foreign Minister of Israel. And till the contrary is proven, we are entitled to rest assured in our belief that peace-loving usurpers are as probable as well meaning burglars.
145.	'The dark side of the world', the Secretary General said almost four years ago, 'shows itself in its most abhorrent and dangerous form in SouthEast Asia.' He described the war in VietNam as 'a war more violent, more cruel, more damaging to human life and prosperity, more harmful to relations among the great Powers and more perilous to the whole world than at any other time during the generation of conflict which that country has known'. This war still rages in VietNam and it has been extended to Laos and Cambodia.
146.	The United States Government embarked on that war, and continues its relentless conduct of it, in flagrant disregard of the most vehement opposition from its own citizens and the censure of world public opinion.
147.	The United States war in VietNam violates the Charter of the United Nations and the Geneva Agreements of 1954 which prohibit any foreign military buildup in VietNam, including the establishment of military alliances. The United States is pursuing this war allegedly in exercise of the right of collective self defense, a pretext that neither satisfies the requirements of Article 51 of the Charter, nor even it if does gives the United States Government the right to destroy civilian settlements and crops by indiscriminate saturation-bombing and the use of chemical weapons.
148.	The United States Government in pursuing such a policy is not only transgressing the principles of the Charter but also betraying the great heritage of the American revolution. I hold many things in this country in great esteem, having been here for a significant length of time, having sat at both ends of a classroom and rubbed shoulders with the better elements of American culture. So it would not b.e presumptuous on my part if I said that it is the greater part of valor if the United States Government heeds the call of the sane elements in this country. It was indeed gratifying the other day to read one of the sober conclusions of Governor Scranton in his report on the campus crisis in which he said:
'' The American young believe that their own country has lost its sense of human purpose. They see the IndoChina war as an onslaught by a technological giant upon the peasant people of a small , and harmless nation.'
149.	The open question today is not whether the United States Government shall abide by the dictates of the Charter but rather whether America shall recapture the spirit of its own revolution.
150.	While evading the living issue of VietNam and Cambodia, the United Nations shamelessly devotes much time, money and effort on the so-called Korean question a remnant of the grim days of the cold war. In Korea, as well as in VietNam, foreign interventions have been justified with reference to the right of collective self-defense. But in the case of Korea the interventionists have acted fraudulently under the flag of the United Nations   in the name of assistance to a beleaguered nation. It is time for the United Nations to extricate itself from this ugly predicament. It does not honor this Organization to serve as an alibi for a perpetual foreign occupation. It does not honor the flag of the United Nations to hover over imperial outposts. The question of Korea, in the last analysis, can be solved only by the Korean people themselves. The role of the United Nations is to ensure evacuation of all foreign troops and afford the free atmosphere in which the people of Korea, split and torn against their will and interest, would determine their own future and achieve a much cherished unification.
151.	Twenty-five years after the reaffirmation by the Charter of 'faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women' the world is still witnessing increasing manifestations of repressions of those ideals. The dream that each may walk in freedom and pride so as to enjoy the fruits of the world is still a scant hope. Practices of discrimination continue to exist and shocking violations of human rights increasingly plague the world.
152.	Here again I do not intend to dwell on the subject in unnecessary detail, leaving the matter to my colleagues in the appropriate Committees, but two questions under this rubric come to the fore and need a special reference: decolonization and racialism.
153.	The United Nations can take pride in its endeavor to help dismantle the old empires. The Charter has reaffirmed beyond equivocation the principle of self-determination of peoples in its opening Article. But that Article continued for too long a time to be a dead letter and the United Nations interest in it continued to be peripheral and academic. The advent of the new Member States in the late 1950s prompted a new initiative and a more radical and liberal interpretation of the Charter. Article 1, paragraph 2, became in effect the launching site of the general offensive against colonialism that culminated in resolution 1514 (XV), the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.
154.	But ten years after the adoption of that Declaration the people of the southern part of Africa still have no reason to rejoice. Vast areas are still plagued by the presence of the last of the unjust; Portuguese colonialism supported by a complex military apparatus and NATO weaponry. The steps taken by this Organization to persuade Portugal to desist from its criminal policy and implement resolution 1514 (XV) were only met by a deaf ear on the part of that country. In the face of this Portuguese intransigence, the African peoples had to take to arms with the full and active support of all African countries and peace-lovers outside our continent. No person can deny the right of the oppressed to rise and break their fetters.
155.	As in Portuguese Territories the people of Zimbabwe found themselves integrated in the cruel system of apartheid through the criminal unilateral act of Ian Smith and the complete abandonment by the United Kingdom of its responsibility to act energetically when action was possible. The United Kingdom has failed to use all the means available to it to put an end to the rebellion in Southern Rhodesia and enable its citizens to achieve independence on the basis of one man one vote.
156.	The development of the principles of human rights enunciated in the Charter ensued from the experiences of the gas chambers. For that reason one would expect the postCharter world to be a more wholesome place where the dignity of man is preserved, but, unfortunately, the world is still peopled by some of the vilest specimens of human beings, who advocate the supremacy of race and cherish the logic of the last solution.
157.	The SecretaryGeneral has, some time ago, warned against an impending racial war. I refer here to U Thant's speech before the Algerian National Assembly on 4 February 1964:
'There is the clear prospect that racial conflict, if we cannot curb and finally eliminate it, will grow into a destructive monster compared to which the religious or ideological conflicts of the past and present will seem like small family quarrels. Such a conflict will eat away the possibilities for good of all that mankind has hitherto achieved and reduce man to the lowest and worst bestial level of intolerance and hatred.'
158.	U Thant has qualified those who engage in such practices as 'the most emotionally backward and most spiritually bankrupt members of the human race'. It is with that background in mind that we view the perilous situation in South Africa, which has extended to encompass Namibia, a Territory that has been handed to us in trust.
159.	Men have ceased to hope that Portugal, Rhodesia and South Africa will adhere to the dictates of reason. It is time the United Nations realized that halfhearted measures will never put an end to this disgrace to mankind. The United Nations is called upon to use all measures within its power, including those provided for in Article 41, if there is any loyalty left to our obligations under the Charter. The barbarism of Pretoria, the crimes of Lisbon and the bestial callousness of Salisbury would not have been possible were it not for the connivance of London, the cynicism of Paris and the hesitations of Washington. If Africa means anything at all to those countries, then Africa wishes to call upon them to show a genuine support for it in its most sacred war: the war for the dignity of the African man.
160.	The fathers of the United Nations at San Francisco promised us a world organization, and it takes all sorts of people to make a world. What was envisaged at San Francisco was a heterogeneity of composition and homogeneity of will. The failure of the United Nations to achieve that heterogeneity   due to the deliberate and irresponsible disruptive attitude of some of its Members   has curtailed the capacity of this Organization to make peace and come to grips with problems in many parts of the world. The Secretary General was correct in stating at one of his press conferences:
'The greatest impediment to the discussion of the question of VietNam in the United Nations is the fact that more than two parties directly concerned in the question are not Members of the Organization.'
161.	The United Nations can no longer continue to close its portals to the people of China, Korea, VietNam and Germany only because of the self righteousness of one of its senior Members.
162.	The People's Republic of China is celebrating today its Twenty-first birthday. The China I refer to is the country that comprises one fourth of the human race, occupies an area larger than that of the United States of America, enshrines within its confine a civilization that has continued longer than any other civilization on this earth, and holds a people with a capacity for sustained effort and industry which is evidenced by their remarkable achievements in technology in the past 20 years.
163.	Do we honestly think that this Organization can establish peace in Asia without China? Do we honestly think that we can achieve disarmament without China? Do we honestly think that the world will take this Organization seriously if it continues to deal with such a major problem in the most frivolous manner, hiding its abdication of responsibility behind diplomatic craft and constitutional artifice? The United Nations, which is now chronologically adult, must behave like a political adult on the China issue. Those who have lost their reason or were made to lose their reason in the past must live up to their international responsibility. They must have learn by now, and at what a price, that the east is red.
164.	If we feel so strongly about the question of China, a country with which my Government entertains the best of relations, we do so particularly in view of the words about new initiatives and reactions. If we want to act, it should be now or never:
'There is a tide in the affairs of men, 'Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune'. So let us take the current when it serves, lest we not only lose a venture but lose above all our sense of responsibility, our serious-mindedness and our self respect.
165.	This is our record over 25 years behind all the rhetoric of parliamentary, and the rituals of private, diplomacy. It leaves an unpleasant taste in my mouth to say that the debit side of the ledger, after all this accounting, leaves one wondering about the moral solvency of the Organization. Our political Organization has even failed to match the ethical standards set and observed by some of its own specialized agencies. The self-righteousness and lack of breadth of outlook on the part of some of the senior Members of the United Nations has left this Organization with a tragic vacuum in moral leadership. We still ask: whither the United Nations?
166.	Allow me, in conclusion, a few minutes to recapitulate my thoughts.
167.	First, the ills of the United Nations lie neither in the Charter nor in the procedure. In the present scheme of things it is highly improbable that a revision of the Charter, even in the unlikely event of its being universally acceptable, would lead to greater effectiveness of the Organization. Similarly, it is not abundantly evident that the United Nations suffers so much from the weight of its cumbersome machinery and amorphous bureaucracy that its effectiveness is impaired.
168.	Second, where the United Nations has failed in its mission, it was essentially due to the subordination of its principles to the interests of its Members, an attitude which represents a serious abdication of international responsibility.
169.	Third, the United Nations cannot hope to realize mankind's dream of universal peace till there is a realization, especially by the major Powers, that the defiant posture of deterrence is ultimately self defeating.
170.	Fourth, in pointing out the dangerously opportunistic attitude of the big Powers, we are not losing sight of some of the bitter facts of international life. We are not calling for the undermining of their power, which is inherent in the Charter; but we are rather underlining a basic jurisprudential maxim which says that for every power there is a correlative responsibility. I hope I am correct in presuming that the United Nations is conceived as a lawful and civilized society rather than an unruly jungle.
171.	Fifth, the great Powers will have to realize also that neither the political nor the jurisprudential concept of power should be construed as giving them sway over other Members. Jurisprudentially, the principle of sovereign equality still holds good, and politically no man is good enough to be another man's master.
172.	Sixth, the logical conclusion of the above arguments requires from all States, big and small, a readiness to coexist and tolerate and respect one another. I say that with particular reference to the wanton references these days to weighted voting and miniStates. Such arguments betray in many quarters a sense of condescend , with undertones of racial and cultural superiority.
173.	Seventh, as a corollary of the reversal of the attitude of subordinating the principles of the Organization to the policies of its Members, the United Nations must be enabled to be truly representative of the interests of mankind. In this connexion, I sincerely believe that the admission of China will help rejuvenate the already hardened veins of this Organization.
174.	It is only then, when all those hopes are achieved, that the United Nations can regain the faith of mankind in its ability to contribute towards the relaxation of international tension.
175.	The hopes of San Francisco are yet to be realized.  Thant was no Cassandra but a wise visionary when he said that the States Members of this Organization had only 10 years to avert a threatening doom. Let us not count the days. Let us instead take courageous and adult steps in this anniversary year to reverse the trend.





"
25,1970,JPN,"
53. Mr. President, on behalf of the Japanese delegation, I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you on your election to the Presidency of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I am confident that, with your outstanding knowledge and abundant experience in the United Nations, you will lead this session to many fruitful accomplishments.
54.	I should also like to take this opportunity to express my profound appreciation to the former President of the General Assembly, Her Excellency Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph. She displayed exceptional skill as an international statesman in guiding the work of the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion. It my great pleasure to note that under her leadership the United Nations was able to enhance further its authority and prestige.
55.	At the same time, I wish to pay my deepest respects to His Excellency U Thant, our esteemed Secretary-General, and express my appreciation for his zeal and devotion to the maintenance of world peace. It is my profound hope that, from an impartial standpoint, he will persevere in his efforts towards the establishment of peace based on freedom and justice.
56.	Later this fall, at the commemorative session of the General Assembly which will celebrate the twenty- fifth anniversary of the United Nations, Prime Minister Sato of Japan will speak on the basic policies of our country. Today, therefore, I should like to confine my remarks to stating how the Government of Japan views the question of re-examination of the activities of the United Nations in the context of the 'struggle for peace', to which I referred during the general debate at the last session of the General Assembly.
57.	A quarter of a century has passed since the United Nations was created with a view to the achievement of lasting world peace and security. However, when we look at the international situation during this period, we note that catastrophe ; been avoided by the balance of power and reciprocal restraint among the major Powers. Under such circumstances it can hardly be said that the foundations of lasting peace have been established.
58.	The balance-of-power situation to which I have just referred has also been reflected in the United Nations. For example, this Organization was unable to make any contribution worthy of special mention with regard to the events in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. As regards the warfare raging in the Indo- Chinese peninsula, the United Nations is still far from finding methods to restore peace in that area, or a way in which it might make a contribution to that end. In the Middle East, the foundation of lasting peace is yet to be established, though the first ray of hope for peace has been seen recently as a result of the efforts made by the United Nations for many years. Moreover, colonial rule and racial discrimination have completely disappeared from the international scene. When we look squarely at these realities of the international situation, I am obliged to concede that the United Nations has not so far fully responded to the high expectation of mankind as the paramount Organization in the 'struggle fr peace'.
59.	The foregoing does not mean, however, that I agree with the extreme argument which judges th' United Nations to be powerless or even useless, as some would say. On the contrary, nothing could be further from my intention. The United Nations has made considerable achievements in the fields of international co-operation for economic and social problems, independence of colonial territories and respect for human rights, among others. It should not be forgotten also that the Organization has achieved certain results in preventing the aggravation of disputes or situations in various parts of the world and in promoting the peaceful settlement of these conflicts. Further, the United Nations has been playing an important role in the formulation of a constructive world opinion by providing a forum in which to discuss diverse problems of world-wide concern and by presenting to the world the facts involved as objectively as possible.
60.	It can be seen from what I have said that the United Nations has achieved a certain measure of success in various fields, and it is incumbent upon this world body to play more vigorously than ever a central role for the maintenance of peace and security in the world to come. The world places great hope in this Organization. In order to respond to that hope it is essential, I believe, to strengthen further the Organization and functions of the United Nations.
61.	On this occasion, I should like to affirm that, notwithstanding the passage of twenty-five years, the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are still worthy of our full support as a norm of conduct for the Member States of this Organization. The Government of Japan wishes to reaffirm the importance of the purposes and principles of the Charter. Above all, we wish to stress once again that the basic obligations of non-use of force and nonintervention in the domestic affairs of other nations, as provided for in Article 2 of the Charter, together with the closely related principle of peaceful settlement of international disputes, as set forth in the same article, constitute the most important elements for the maintenance of international peace and security. These are, indeed, the essential minimum obligations of all Member States.
62.	On the other hand, the United Nations has failed to realize what might be considered an ideal peacekeeping mechanism, foreseen in the Charter as a means to fulfill it purposes and principles. In seeking the best ways an weans to realize the ideals of the United Nations at its inception and to achieve its purposes, we must base ourselves on the recognition of this reality. The problem is how to make this Organization function as a truly effective organization for peace in the rapidly evolving international situation. The answer to this problem must be sought in exploring possibilities for adapting the United Nations constantly to this ever- changing world. It Is indispensable for us all to be open-minded towards introducing improvements, as need arises, in the provisions of the Charter or its application. Clearly, Chapter XVIII of the Charter reflects this way of thinking. I am convinced that the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations is the appropriate occasion to renew our efforts to breathe new life into the Organization.
63.	It would seem most appropriate to recall in this connexion that the Secretary-General opened the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization by affirming that the 'need for an effective world organization which can serve as a harmonizing agent for peace has never been so urgently required by mankind' [A 180011Add. 1 and Corr.l, para.l]. The basic questions he has raised at the outset of his introduction are all very pertinent to this theme:
'What are the means by which the United Nations can play an increasingly vital role in the world of tomorrow? How can the United Nations make more effective use of its possibilities for reconciling differences between its sovereign Member States? What changes can be evolved in its methods of operation so that its capacity for improving the human condition will be utilized to the full?' /Tbid J
I share completely the fervent hope he has expressed:
'that we shall find the answers to questions such as these and continue to make progress no matter how slow and painstaking it may at times appear towards realizing the noble goals set forth in the Charter of the United Nations' [ibid
64.	I do not believe that review of the organization and functions of the United Nations, including the question of reviewing the Charter, could be completed in a short time. It will require sustained effort for a lengthy period. At the initiative of the delegations of Colombia and certain other countries at the last session of the General Assembly, the problem concerning the review of the Charter of the United Nations was included in the provisional agenda of the present session. The Government of Japan finds it particularly significant that the General Assembly embarks upon the discussion of this important question at this session. I am sure that this item will appear on the agenda as duly proposed.
65.	In the light of the basic considerations which I have just expounded, I should now like to make a few suggestions on certain matters regarding which renewed examination would be desirable and even necessary in the view of my Government.
66.	First of all, I should like to discuss strengthening the functions of the United Nations for keeping peace. In so doing, I intend to take up three different subjects, namely, strengthening of United Nations peacekeeping operations, strengthening also of the fact-finding functions of the United Nations and reexamination of the composition of Security Council membership.
67.	With regard to the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations, the Government of Japan estimates at a high value the role which the United Nations has performed and is performing in various parts of the world, such as in Kashmir, in the Middle East, in the Congo and in Cyprus. It is my ardent hope that the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations performed in the future, with the support of world public opinion and also with the consent of all parties concerned, will render great benefit to world peace. I believe, therefore, that we should make further efforts to explore methods to strengthen peace-keeping operations on an even more effective, smooth and secured basis. It is true that we have been working over the past several years in the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. To our great regret, however, the Special Committee has hardly achieved anything substantial, mainly due to differences of opinion among the major Powers.
68.	I should think that it would be appropriate to provide for peace-keeping operations in specific terms within the framework of the pacific settlement of disputes as set forth in the Charter. This would help to ensure the more effective performance of such operations. To this end I have felt the need for careful study of this matter.
69.	My Government is fully aware of the wide difference of views among the major Powers, above all between the two blocs of East and West on this issue. I should like to emphasize, however, that peacekeeping operations constitute the most effective and practically workable function of the United Nations today in carrying out its task of maintaining international peace. The strengthening of peace-keeping operations is essential for the future of this world. Organization, and we strongly hope, therefore, that the super-Powers, conscious of their special responsibilities in this regard, will take concrete action to this end. Japan, for its part, will co-operate actively towards strengthening the function of the United Nations to maintain international peace in a manner consonant with its position as a nation dedicated to the cause of peace.
70.	At this juncture I should like to say a few words about the Conference of Foreign Ministers of interested Asian and Pacific countries on the question of Cambodia. That Conference, the purpose of which was to discuss the critical situation in Cambodia, was held in Djakarta on 16 and 17 May 1970, at the invitation of the Government of Indonesia, and I was one of the participants. As a result of the Conference, a consensus was leached to the effect that restoration of peace in Cambodia should be based on respect for neutrality, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, non-interference in internal affairs and withdrawal of all foreign forces. Based upon this consensus, the special representatives of the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan held a number of consultations, in particular with the co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference and others concerned, on ways and means to reactivate the international Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodian to convene an international conference of all parties concerned. The special representatives also talked with the Secretary-General of the United Nations as well as the President and other members of the Security Council to explore what actions might be taken by the United Nations.
71.	I am convinced that the appeals made at the Djakarta Conference by the Asian and Pacific countries with regard to the restoration of peace in Cambodia are endorsed by the principles and purposes of the Charter, and I see no ground for any legitimate objection being raised to those appeals. It is hoped that in future the United Nations will come to assume a useful role in ensuring peace in Cambodia and consequently in the whole area of the Indo-China peninsula. In such a case, a most effective way would be to make full use of its peace-keeping functions, including truce supervision.
72.	Out of the same concern for strengthening the function of the Organization for the maintenance of international peace, I should now like to touch upon the importance of the fact-finding function of the United Nations. One of the major roles expected of the United Nations in the existing international situation is, in my view, to offer to the world public, with maximum objectivity, accounts of disputes, unfortunate situations and other similar events which do not cease to take place in the world. For this purpose it is indispensable for the Organization to have its fact-finding capacity strengthened and reinforced. Specifically, we should study how to strengthen the functions of the Security Council, of the General Assembly and of the Secretary-General in the field of fact-finding. Furthermore, in order to assist these organs of the United Nations in carrying out their fact-finding functions, expert groups or fact-finding panels should be better utilized and their competence extended.
73.	I should now like to turn to the third subject, that is, re-examination of the composition of Security Council membership. In the interest of the maintenance of international peace and security, it is essential to ensure that the Security Council, which has the primary responsibility in this field, be a body truly capable of taking effective action commensurate with its high authority and responsibility accorded by the Charter.
74.	Great changes have taken place in the international situation over the twenty-five years since the Second World War. In the meantime, the balance between the super-Powers, based upon mutual nuclear deterrence, has decreased the possibility of another major war. However, to achieve true world peace, we must remove all causes of international conflict at their source and promote the welfare and the security of all mankind. It is thus essential to solve the problems of poverty and under-development which lie at the root of international tensions. It is also indispensable to overcome all forms of racial discrimination and to promote mutual understanding among peoples. In such efforts for the construction of peace, our performance in the economic, scientific, technological and cultural, rather than in the military, fields will become a preponderant factor.
75.	It is on the basis of the foregoing considerations that I wish to emphasize the need to review the composition of the permanent membership of the Security Council. Thus, nuclear military capability should not become a decisive factor in any consideration of qualification for permanent membership, although most of the present permanent members are nuclear weapon States. Attention should rather be paid to such a pertinent factor as a positive attitude towards the universal prohibition of nuclear weapons. I wish to stress this point, in particular, since the Japanese Government maintains its policy of abandoning nuclear weapons in spite of its potential nuclear capability. The acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice could be another important factor as evidence of the peaceful intention of the States concerned. In order that the Security Council be enabled to achieve its responsibilities effectively, I am convinced that a review should be instituted taking the foregoing points into due consideration. Pending such a review, it would be of paramount importance, in strengthening the Security Council, that in the election of non-permanent members of the Council due regard should be 'specially paid, in the first instance to the contribution of Members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the other purposes of the Organization' as provided in Article 23 of the Charter.
76.	Allow me now to touch briefly upon the economic and social aspects of United Nations activities. As I have said, I am confident that the United Nations has fulfilled, and is capable of fulfilling, the responsibility for playing a great role in the construction of peace through its activities in the economic, social, cultural, human, environmental and other fields.
77.	The United Nations has established a number of organizations in the field of construction of peace, and each of them has been engaged in useful activities. At the same time, it has been recognized that there is duplication or conflict of work in some fields of the activities of the United Nations family of organizations, including the specialized agencies, and that these organizations are faced with a number of problems which require careful examination from the viewpoint of the effective deployment and use of human and material resources and the rationalization of organization.
78.	I believe that the United Nations should further strengthen its organization and functions in the economic and social fields in order that it may launch more organized and more effective activities for the construction of peace during the Second United Nations Development Decade, which will have a great bearing on the future of mankind. For that purpose, the Economic and Social Council should act as the pivotal organ for realizing better co-ordination and greater efficiency in the work of the United Nations family of organizations.
79.	In this connexion, I note with appreciation that the United Nations has been making serious efforts towards strengthening and improving its organization for furthering economic and social development, and I sincerely hope that these efforts will have a positive outcome.
80.	Lastly, I should like to point out that there are some provisions in the Charter which no longer fit the present situation. For example, the United Nations in our times should be freed from remnants of the Second World War of twenty-five years ago, and I should like to urge strongly that the 'enemy State' provisions in Articles 53 and 107 be deleted from the Charter, since there is clearly no necessity to maintain them.
81.	In pursuing the 'struggle for peace' in which the United Nations should play the leading role, we should constantly bear in mind the importance of the establishment of justice and the rule of law. In this sense, we should in no way underestimate the contribution that could be made for the cause of peace by the International Court of Justice, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. I believe that in the reexamination of the organization and functions of the United Nations, we should give serious consideration to what we should do for the strengthening of the International Court of Justice.
82.	Although we have been spared the catastrophe of world-wide war for a quarter of a century, we are still far away from attaining everlasting peace. Hatred and jealousy among peoples must be eliminated. Boundaries must cease to cause the flowing of blood. Differences of race, culture, ideology and religion must not be the sources of mutual distrust or enmity. Thus, infinitely great is the task of the United Nations, the task of uniting the wisdom and endeavours of all humanity aimed at 'progress and harmony for mankind', the theme of the World Exposition held in Japan this year.
83.	On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations, I should like to urge strongly that all Member States and all the peoples of the world who uphold the ideals and activities of the United Nations should combine their strength under this Organization in the 'struggle for peace'.
"
25,1970,GIN,"35.	  The delegation of the Republic of Guinea to the Twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, at a time when the international community is preparing to celebrate its Twenty-fifth anniversary, joins all the previous speakers in making its contribution to the general debate which is to be concluded today. We do so with all the more faith, conviction and optimism because the date of 2 October marks the anniversary of our accession to full sovereignty.
36.	In spite of all the efforts to promote peace, progress and justice, the year 1970 which is coming towards its end presents, in our view, a discouraging and gloomy picture, marked by the ever-growing gap between the industrialized countries and the developing countries, by the persistence of colonial oppression, injustice and imperialist aggression which seems to be the lot of the oppressed peoples of the third world.
37.	In Africa, apartheid, which is a crime against humanity and a denial of the elementary rights of man, still remains the only system of government of the white, fascist and racist minority of South Africa. The support by certain great Powers of the Pretoria regime confirms that apartheid, unanimously condemned by the United Nations, still remains powerful in practice, in spite of the fine words and declarations of intention made by various people.
38.	We still note with bitterness that millions of Africans groan under the unbearable weight of the most barbarous form of racism, the most inhuman which could possibly exist. It goes without saying that this system of government constitutes a real threat to international peace and security. The dictatorship of the white racists of South Africa has been extended to Namibia, a Trust Territory of the United Nations, in spite of General Assembly resolution 2145 (XXI) and Security Council resolution 269 (1969), both of which put an end to the South African Mandate over this African Territory.
39.	The International Court of Justice is dealing with this matter, but until now it has not handed down any satisfactory verdict with regard to this repugnant situation.
40.	In the face of the persistent refusal of the Pretoria regime to implement the relevant resolutions of the various bodies of our Organization, our Organization should face up to its responsibilities and make the Pretoria Government see reason simply by the application of the Charter.
41.	The unilateral proclamation of pseudo independence by the white minority in Rhodesia extends and maintains a permanent threat to peace and security. The use of force and violence to crush liberation movements is without any doubt a permanent source of tension which prevails in that part of Africa. This flagrant denial of justice is a challenge to the international community and particularly to the African peoples.
42.	The Power responsible for this state of affairs is undeniably the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We continue to believe that it is only by the use of force that an end can be put to this injustice.
43.	It is easy to note the coalition of the racist, fascist regime of South Africa and of the white reactionary minority of Rhodesia with the slave masters of Lisbon, which constitutes a genuine threat to international peace and security.
44.	From another point of view, the arms race and war preparations on the part of the colonialist and racist regimes threaten the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of African States and imperil the rights of the peoples of Africa, rights explicitly recognized by the Charter of the United Nations.
45.	We denounce all forms of economic, military and other kinds of aid to racist and colonialist regimes, whether that aid takes the form of foreign investments, military the provision of arms or the building of factories on their Territory, since it all constitutes a policy designed to support the oppressor and to perpetuate the oppression.
46.	This is the proper occasion for our delegation to raise its voice in energetic protest against the sale of arms to South Africa by certain Member States, particularly certain members of the Security Council, which are thus shirking the international obligations which are imposed upon them by the Charter.
47.	In this regard, the seventh session of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held in Addis Ababa in September 1970, deplored the attitude of the NATO countries which continue to sell arms to South Africa and to provide it with financial assistance, thus enabling it to pursue its policy of repression against the innocent African people by intensifying its policy of apartheid.
48.	Peace, security, justice and progress are indivisible. Peace, as we conceive it, cannot exist so long as there are hotbeds of war, however localized they may be.
49.	There are some people who conceive peace as being a balance of power between the great Powers, but that is not real peace. Peace with the continued existence of regimes that exploit and oppress peoples is not peace either. And, as President Ahmed Sekou Toure wrote:
'Peace is not simply an interval between two wars; nor is it the product of a compromise between conflicting interests. It should, above all, be the result of the elimination of the fundamental causes of insecurity in the world; and hence it cannot be a matter of concern to the great Powers only but should require in fact the active and conscious participation of all the peoples in the struggle that must be waged in the light, not of the dangerous strategy of the balance of power, but in accordance with the genuine interests of all peoples. The Republic of Guinea supports unreservedly any decision that may be taken to reduce international tension. We are determined similarly to oppose any attempt to maintain the status quo, which would mean inadmissible differentiations, inequalities and discriminations in the living conditions of certain peoples and in relations among nations,'
50.	For 25 years now there have been hotbeds of war in the world. The brave, valiant people of VietNam for 25 years have been the victim of aggression by imperialist Powers. The people of Laos and now, unfortunately, the people of Cambodia have also fallen victim to foreign aggression and flagrant intervention in their internal affairs. Those people are waging an armed struggle to safeguard their liberty and sovereignty and to restore their unity. Puppet regimes installed here and there by colonialism cannot overcome the will of those people, however many tons of bombs, shells, cannons and other arms of mass destruction are used against them.
51.	The peoples of Asia, like the peoples of Africa, have always suffered from injustice and the arbitrary whim of the aggressor. The valiant and courageous people of Korea, divided for 20 years, seeks only to achieve its national unity, from north to south. At this point, let me recall that the People's Democratic Republic of Korea has expressed repeatedly its wish to participate in the work of the United Nations as a sovereign State, and hence fully subscribe to the Charter of our Organization. The division of the Korean people and the maintenance of foreign troops on its soil under the flag of the United Nations constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter ilSwllf*
52.	A state of war continues in the Middle East and we speak with particular sadness and distress after the premature and unexpected death of the great Arab leader, the late lamented President Gamal Abdel Nasser and the military occupation by Israel of Arab territories remains a painful and distressing fact. The resolutions of the Security Council, in particular its resolution of 22 November 1967 [242 (1967)], have remained dead letters. If certain plans and certain good offices gave rise to a glimmer of hope, that hope was snuffed out very quickly by the adjournment sine die of the Jarring mission. For our part, we remain convinced that peace in the Middle East can be brought about only by the active and effective participation of all the parties, particularly the Palestinians. Peace cannot be restored in that part of the world without the total and unconditional evacuation of all territories occupied by force.
53.	The stubbornness with which the Portuguese Government continues to consider African Territories still under its domination as an extension of its own national territory is an aberration, an anachronism which should be ended immediately. In Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), the fascist slave master Government of Lisbon, supported by the NATO Powers, using chemical weapons, including napalm, poison gas and defoliants, is systematically exterminating the freedom fighters and innocent African peoples. Assured of the support of its NATO protectors and convinced of the' ineffectiveness of the United Nations, Portugal continues deliberately to violate the Charter and the resolutions of this international Organization. This being the case, African countries like the Republic of Guinea have repeatedly brought to the attention of the United Nations violations by Portuguese forces of their national territory, their air space and their territorial waters.
54.	We bring now to the attention of world public opinion the military and psychological preparations now under way in Guinea (Bissau) against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Guinea. Those preparations which are taking place in special training camps in Guinea (Bissau) include the military training of stateless Africans in the pay of imperialism and white mercenaries for the purpose of invading the national territory of Guinea.
55.	All those diabolical and Machiavellian plans being hatched by imperialism are designed to curb and jeopardize the economic and social development of Guinea, but they are all doomed to failure. We repeat that the violation of our air space by Portuguese military aircraft occurs all the time. The most recent incident took place on Saturday, 19 September 1970, at 1615 hours GMT, in the administrative regions of Boke in lower Guinea and Labe in mid-Guinea, along the river Komba.
56.	We cannot overlook the maintenance of military bases in Africa and the existence on our continent of enclaves of foreign domination. Our delegation condemns the presence of those bases and the continued existence of those enclaves. Disarmament, while a major problem, can be effective only if all mankind is involved in its aspiration to genuine peace. Disarmament is therefore a matter of concern not only to the great Powers but to mankind as a whole and we cannot speak of effective disarmament so long as there exist hotbeds of war, the arbitrary and artificial division of States and so long as a great Power like the People's Republic of China is absent from the forums where that problem is discussed.
57.	The policy of ostracism pursued by the United States of America towards the People's Republic of China must be ended. Indeed, we cannot keep the People's Republic of China outside the United Nations any longer without doing serious damage to the spirit of universality of our Organization. The People's Republic of China, a country of750 million inhabitants, or a quarter of mankind, as everyone knows, has made tremendous progress in all fields and has, by the courage of its valiant people and its scientists, undoubtedly become an atomic Power.
58.	In the field of the exploration of outer space, the People's Republic of China has victoriously joined the circle of the great Powers.
59.	The Government and the people of the Republic of Guinea, faithful to their ideals of peace and justice, demand the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations by the expulsion of the puppet clique in Formosa. The People's Republic of China is a peaceful country which maintains fruitful and friendly relations in the diplomatic, economic and cultural fields with the Republic of Guinea.
60.	Economic problems certainly constitute a major concern for a genuine balance in the world. The First United Nations Development Decade, which failed, is to give way to the Second Development Decade. The various development plans, even if well designed technically, cannot achieve positive results unless we succeed in avoiding the errors of the past and only if we take account of the clearly expressed will of the third world countries.
61.	We believe that we must have effective international solidarity in the conception and implementation of a policy of assistance. This assistance for the development of the developing countries should not be considered either as alms or as serving the purposes of propaganda and subversion in those countries.The danger for the third world of an imbalance created through technical and financial assistance is not just a matter of empty words.
62.	International cooperation must be disinterested. It must respect the political, economic, social and cultural institutions of the recipient countries in order to avoid a return to camouflaged forms of colonialism, that is to say, neocolonialism.
63.	Permit us to pay a sincere tribute to our Secretary General, U Thant, for his great contribution to the achievement of United Nations objectives.
64.	Twenty-five years ago, in the name of and with the knowledge of mankind, the peoples of the world signed in the historic city of San Francisco the United Nations Charter and thus undertook:
'to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and
'to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and
'to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and
'to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.'
Never has a human act given rise to so many hop s, confidence and faith in the future of peoples.
65.	Twenty-five years have elapsed from 1945 to 1970, 25 years of thought, action and experience, 25 years of efforts crowned with some victories of course, but, above all, with failures, disappointments and bitter disillusionment.
66.	Therefore, in the view of the delegation of the Republic of Guinea, this session should be the occasion for the international Organization to undertake a rigorous, searching self-criticism of its past actions in order to create the best possible conditions of effectiveness for its actions in the satisfaction of the profound and legitimate aspirations of the people to freedom, justice, peace, and social and democratic progress.
67.	If we can on the one hand take pleasure to a certain extent from the balance sheet of the activities of certain specialized agencies of the United Nations and on the other hand of the partial results of decolonization, we are nonetheless forced to note that foreign intervention, colonial domination and the designs of imperialists against the sovereignty of the peoples in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Latin America, disarmament, the question of faithful and sincere international cooperation, the universality of the Organization today still constitute the major concerns of mankind.
68.	Indeed if the United Nations has not always remained passive in the face of permanent and flagrant violations of its Charter, it still has been reduced to impotence and inaction by the behaviour of the great Powers which, anxious to establish an artificial balance of power among themselves, deal arbitrarily with world problems which they settle to suit themselves and in the light of their exclusive interests which, of course, takes us further away from the principle of the equality of all nations great and small.
69.	But in spite of its inadequacies the United Nations is indispensable for the maintenance of a certain necessary balance if humanity is to survive. It is important therefore to fill in these gaps and to make up for the inadequacies which are inherent in it.
70.	Basing ourselves on the 25 years of experience of the Organization, we should, before concluding our statement, like to make a few suggestions.
71.	The Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples should, in our view, be reaffirmed so that decolonization can really and finally become effective.
72.	The colonial Powers should finally be brought to see reason by our conscious and effective solidarity with the freedom fighters. If Africa, by the Lusaka Manifesto, recommended a dialog with the colonial
Powers, it has now become quite clear that this appeal has not received the required response.
73.	Africa considers any aid, direct or indirect, material or political, provided to the racists and fascists in Pretoria, to the minority regime in Rhodesia and to the slavery-minded regime in Lisbon as de facto complicity.
74.	The financial aid provided to Portugal for the construction of the Cabora Bassa Dam constitutes direct aid to a minority, reactionary and fascist regime which is represented by the white minority in South Africa.
75.	On the particular and specific problem of the seabed and ocean floor, we think that today, even more than in the past, the national sovereignty of a Member State should embrace a more extensive area. It is well known, and positive international law endorses this, that the sovereignty of a State applies to its territorial area and air space, all delimited by the frontiers of fact or law of the State in question. The recognition and juridical protection of this status is of extreme political and strategic importance for the international community. All international meetings of any kind stress the need for respecting the sacrosanct principle of the national sovereignty of States.
76.	But if one glances at the political map of the world, one realizes that a State is not always separated off from another State by natural frontiers, in fact or in law. There are States which border on rivers, seas and oceans. But one cannot confine their frontiers to the point where the sea meets the land. To delimit the zone of territorial waters over which the sovereignty of a State is exercised fully and without obstruction remains one of the imperative concerns for States and the international community.
77.	In any case, the Republic of Guinea does not intend for the time being to make any modification in the arrangements already made by it to guarantee its security and its sovereignty.
78.	We are convinced of the necessity to reshape the United Nations Charter. This need is all the more imperative because our Organization, which had 52 Member States when it was created, now has 126, three quarters of which are from the third world.
79.	The United Nations, conceived as an institution serving mankind, must necessarily take account of the economic, political and social evolution of this very mankind and should not remain a fixed and fossilized institution in a world which is in perpetual flux.
80.	The United Nations should adapt itself, first of all, by a re-framing of its Charter; secondly, by the abolition of privileges enjoyed by certain Member States; thirdly, by the expansion of the Security Council; fourthly, by the effective implementation of the principle of universality within the United Nations.
81.	It is by taking into account all these principles that the delegation of the Republic of Guinea, faithful to its fundamental policies and its ideals of true freedom, peace, justice and democratic and social progress, will wholeheartedly contribute to the work of this session.
82.	The delegation of the Republic of Guinea is convinced that Ambassador Hambro's election to the presidency of this important session guarantees the success of our work. The policy of Norway, his country, which is essentially neutral and has no colonial past, his distinguished and eminent personality and his long experience of international problems constitute a sure guarantee of the success of this session.




"
25,1970,CRI,"62.	  Mr. President, your election to the Presidency of this Assembly constitutes just recognition of your qualities as a skillful diplomat with a deep and profound knowledge of this Organization. Your election is also a well-earned tribute to your country, Norway, and exemplary democracy which faithfully complies with the Charter of the United Nations. For all those reasons my delegation is happy to join in the words of congratulation that have been spoken at the outset of the statements of all the speakers who preceded me at the rostrum.
63.	It is my honor to represent in this Assembly a nation which has turned the principles of the Charter of the United Nations into the fundamental rules of its international conduct. That is why I am able to affirm today, without any reservations whatsoever, that Costa Rica adheres to the principles of the sovereign equality of States, the free self-determination of peoples, the peaceful solution of disputes, respect for human rights, nonintervention, international cooperation in the solution of economic, social, cultural, scientific and humanitarian problems all of which have as their purpose the achievement of international peace and security.
64.	My delegation does not share the pessimistic view held by some concerning the achievements of the UnLed Nations during the quarter of a century that has elapsed since its foundation. Despite its limitations and failures, the Organization has managed to avoid the outbreak of generalized armed warfare, thus preserving the major part of mankind from the scourge of war which, as is said in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations, 'twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind'. This achievement in itself justifies the existence of the United Nations, but the precarious manner in which it has been attained demands increased efforts to enable our Organization to carry out its peacekeeping work more effectively.
65.	The United Nations has furnished a proper forum for the airing of problems among nations. Without this,
they would have passed unperceived until armed conflict gave them notoriety. It has thus created an international opinion which is vigilant and which in many cases has been strong enough to dissuade those who wish to maintain an unjust attitude.
66.	In the twenty-five years that have elapsed since its foundation the United . Nations has accelerated the process of decolonization and has strengthened in a form that has never been equaled before the right of peoples to self-determination.
67.	It has also implemented excellent programs of technical and educational assistance. It has promoted international cooperation in the economic field, although in this respect it has met with only very relative success. The studies carried out by the United Nations on problems of development, although they have not been utilized efficiently to close the growing gap between the poor and rich countries, have nevertheless highlighted the international causes of the poverty which afflicts two thirds of mankind. They have further stressed the need for the industrialized countries to cooperate in the development of the poor countries as the sole means of preserving their own prosperity.
68.	As is evident, although in these twenty-five years the scourge of generalized warfare has been avoided, there has never once been general, worldwide peace. Our Organization has been unable to solve the acute problems confronting certain nations in armed conflicts and even groups of nations among themselves. Violence continues to afflict large portions of mankind, for which justice does not prevail. Despite the United Nations, many peoples live deprived of their freedom.
69.	We must frankly admit that this impotence of the Organization to solve armed conflicts and avoid situations of injustice arises from the fact that many Member States mainly the most powerful ones have refused to restrict their sovereignty to the extent necessary to turn the United Nations into an efficient instrument for the maintenance of peace. Our Organization has, with respect to such conflicts, been reduced to serving as a mere center for the expression of theories and the forming of international opinion. This is not a negligible result but is, however, far from the fundamental goal of those who created the Organization and those who subsequently adhered to its principles.
70.	The hope to end the cruel war in VietNam is no more likely to be fulfilled this year than it was last year. This costly experience has shown that the conflict cannot be resolved by military means. Nevertheless not an iota of improvement has been achieved in the field of negotiations. The Paris talks have been resumed in an atmosphere that bodes no prospects of improvement.
71.	We must recognize that the United States Government has made positive attempts to create a climate more appropriate to negotiation. Not only was the bombing of North VietNam halted more than a year ago, but large contingents of troops have already been
withdrawn from South VietNam. But these gestures were not reciprocated by the other side, which has shown not the least will to negotiate. Those who set down prior conditions cannot negotiate because the acceptance of those prior conditions would signify the unilateral imposition of their views, which is a denial to negotiate.
72.	Viable peace proposals submitted by South VietNam and the United States have two main purposes: the withdrawal of all forces which are not South VietNamese and the holding of free elections, internationally controlled, in which all the citizens of South VietNam would participate, .to choose the Government which would assume power at the end of hostilities. These are reasonable and fair proposals worthy of being favorably viewed by those who allege that they are defending the self-determination of the South VietNamese people. But they will accept only the withdrawal of the allied forces from South VietNam and the overthrow of the duly-elected present Government of that country. The terrible result of this unyielding attitude of those who wish arbitrarily to impose their will at all costs is the prolongation of a cruel war destructive to both life and property.
73.	It is strange to note that those who urge South VietNam and its allies to make more concessions with a view to achieving progress in the Paris talks have never thought of requesting the Government of North VietNam or the Vietcong to do likewise. My Government hopes that the inflexible attitude of those who refuse to negotiate will change in the interest of world peace. Only thus will the South VietNamese people be enabled to decide its own fate, free from any foreign intervention and any domestic violence. This solution can be durable only if it has the support of international public opinion. And it is here that the United Nations can and must make its contribution to peace in that area of SouthEast Asia.
74.	The Middle East conflict continues to represent a very serious threat to world peace. No other local dispute or conflict is so heavily loaded with the danger of being converted into a world war. That is why the United Nations cannot overlook this problem; nor can it leave the solution in the hands of the big Powers. By every means possible our Organization must seek a way to solve the crisis which, during the last twenty- two years, has provoked three wars between Israel and the Arab States.
75.	The Government of Costa Rica shared the satisfaction expressed by the majority of Governments here when informed that the parties concerned accepted the United States proposal for a temporary ceasefire and the initiation of negotiations through the mediation of Mr. Ambassador Jarring; and, like most of the Governments represented here, that of Costa Rica regrets that it has not been possible to start these negotiations owing to the partial lack of compliance of one of the parties concerned with the terms of the ceasefire agreement. Nevertheless, my delegation entertains the hope that the violations will be rectified in order that negotiations may begin. These negotiations, led by Ambassador Jarring, must create a favorable climate so that the Arabs and Israelis could meet again as in 1949 at that time in order to negotiate an armistice, and now to negotiate a peace treaty.
76.	Direct negotiation has no substitute as a means of putting a final end to the hostilities between States and promoting a durable peace. But in order for these negotiations to be true negotiations, they cannot be subjected to prior conditions which imply definite concessions by one of the parties. Negotiations must be open and clear with a view to seeking a solution of all the causes of a conflict.
77.	The Arab Governments declared in 1949 that the armistice lines could not be interpreted as being political or territorial frontiers and that such frontiers should be settled by means of agreements in the transition towards peace. Since these agreements were never achieved, the conversations through Mr. Jarring cannot be subjected to the prior condition that Israel should withdraw its troops behind frontiers which have never truly existed.
78.	In order for Israel to be able to comply fully with Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which calls for the withdrawal of its occupation forces, it is necessary first of all for these frontiers to be fixed by means of a peace treaty. Israel has never refused to withdraw its troops to the 1967 ceasefire line, but on the basis of the painful experience of three wars and twenty-two years of constant warfare, logically, it is necessary for the withdrawal to take place to secure and stable frontiers which should be fully recognized by the belligerent parties in peace treaties. Costa Rica considers this position of Israel to be a fair one and thus openly supports it.
79.	I repeat that best way of fostering harmony in the Near East is, in the view of my Government, to achieve direct negotiations between Arabs and Israelis without any prior conditions, for the termination of a conflict which for more than two decades has soaked the biblical lands in blood. My Government believes that the United Nations should use the full weight of it influence, should dedicate itself fully, should sharpen its wits in order to achieve, as soon as possible the initiation of these direct negotiations.
80.	To this end it is necessary for the big Powers to abstain from participating in the conflict for the purpose of fostering their own political or strategic interests. The Near East is too explosive a field in which to play the game of spheres of influence. If the Arab Israeli conflict is isolated from the machinations of the great Powers to tip the balance of world peace in their favor it will be easier to get the parties to the conflict to sit at the conference table and put an end to mutual hostilities, and to attain a peace which will be the beginning of great cooperation, and even of certain forms of economic integration, among the peoples who live in the Near East.
81.	In this analysis of present armed conflicts I am able to announce with satisfaction that Central America has continued to take firm steps toward the consolidation of peace. Bilateral negotiations between Honduras and Salvador for the purpose of finding a definite solution to the painful armed conflict which took place had been interrupted by border incidents. It is difficult to negotiate when there are clashes between the parties negotiating. The Organization of American States, which had so successfully achieved a ceasefire last year, had not managed to get the parties to reach an agreement on the demilitarization of the border line which was necessary in order to avoid new incidents.
82.	Upon the initiative of the President of Costa Rica, Mr. Jose Figueres, taken on the very day on which he assumed the presidency of the State, the Central American foreign Ministers met in San Jose at the end of last May. From this meeting emerged an agreement between Salvador and Honduras, guaranteed by Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, for the establishment of a zone of peace and security all along the border line. Supervision of this zone is in the hands of Latin American military observers appointed by the OAS. Thanks to this San Jose Agreement, border incidents have ceased and bilateral negotiations have been resumed in order to seek solutions for a final peace.
83.	The solution of this conflict has enabled the five Ministers of Economic Affairs, and the five Foreign Ministers afterward, to hold meetings in Managua and Guatemala, where special procedures were approved in order to get under way once again the supervisory bodies of Central American integration. In informing this General Assembly of the success of peacekeeping tasks achieved in Central America, my delegation expresses the wish for a satisfactory and positive conclusion of the bilateral negotiations under way between Honduras and Salvador because my delegation is convinced that only these negotiations can lead to a definite peace. Our work in this case has been to create the conditions and give the necessary guarantees in order for the parties to be able to negotiate freely; but these, and only these parties can truly solve their own problems. Direct negotiations are a means of achieving the transformation of rhetoric and polemic forms of debate into a concrete, specific and detailed formulation of controversial questions.
84.	Our faith in direct negotiations is fostered by our experience in Central America, and it is this which has prompted us to urge the United Nations to dedicate itself fully to the purpose of having the parties to conflicts which have not been solved sit down together in direct negotiations without prior conditions. Any refusal to negotiate directly creates tension and suspicion while direct negotiation often creates a leeway for new ideas and new imaginative efforts which often provoke conciliatory formulas which did not exist at the outset of the conversations.
85.	Hijacking, which is increasing at an alarming rate, is a serious and disturbing factor as far as peace is concerned because these acts, which constitute offenses of piracy and which are morally, politically and legally unjustifiable, also constitute acts of aggression by the Governments which give asylum to the hijackers, and which are contrary to the interest of the nations affected by the hijacking. In a recent resolution [286 (1970)] the Security Council recommended to the Member States that they should take all relevant steps to avoid a repetition of acts of air piracy. My delegation is happy to support that resolution. Prior to this resolution Costa Rica had already taken the necessary steps in order to turn air hijacking to a new specific offence which is severely sanctioned in the Penal Code that has been recently promulgated.
86.	Nevertheless, my delegation feels that the best way of putting an end to acts of hijacking is to get the Governments that have given asylum to the hijackers to correct their behaviour and to agree to hand them over to the legal authorities of the States having jurisdiction over the hijacking case concerned. Without the aggressive complicity of the Governments giving asylum, acts of hijacking could not be so easily perpetrated because what encourages the hijackers to commit their crimes is the secure knowledge that they will go free, and even be treated like heroes of violence, instead of being treated like delinquents guilty of crimes against mankind.
87.	Unfortunately, it was a Government of a country of the American continent, that of Cuba, which began the criminal practice of giving asylum to hijackers. This Cuban policy, a consequence of that continent of its subversive activity against other Governments, was promptly emulated by other Governments with manifestations of violence against the airlines and the passengers of States with which they are in conflict. Thus, the prophets of violence found other means of protesting against the state of affairs which they did not like. If the Cuban Government had apprehended the first hijackers and as International Law requires, had placed them at the disposal of the tribunals of the countries which are empowered to deal with them, we would not today be witnessing with great surprise and horror
the increasing number of assaults on planes in flight.
88.	Giving asylum to hijackers, as I have already said, constitutes an act of aggression against the State which has jurisdiction over the hijacked plane. When asylum is given by a Government, as happened in the majority of cases, the State giving asylum should be subjected to the sanctions which the Security Council must impose on those who commit acts of aggression liable to threaten peace among nations. As long as this truth is not recognized with courage, as long as transgressing Governments are not required to abstain from granting asylum, hijacking will continue to endanger the security of all air travelers and the integrity of the order on which the international community depends.
89.	We are happy to point out here that Costa Rica, along with many other delegations, supported, the resolution which designated 1971 as the International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination [2544 (XXIV)], We are thus reiterating our efforts of many years to try to eliminate one of the most flagrant violations of human rights. It is well known that Costa Rica has participated ever since its inception in the work of the Special Committee on the Policies of Apartheid of the Government of the Republic of South Africa. We have collaborated there with the other members of that Committee in order to arrive at means which will lead to the successful achievement of the purposes for which it was created.
90.	However, we have already repeated here many times in many meetings that the flagrant violations of human rights do not occur only in the sphere of racial discrimination. That is why we wish to express our particular interest in an acceleration of the process necessary to render effective the postulates of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which have been so beautifully embodied in the international agreements on human rights. We regret that hitherto there has not been a sufficient number of ratifications of these optional instruments for the protection and the strengthening of human rights throughout the world. Nevertheless, we hope that soon a sufficient number of ratifications will be forthcoming. For this reason Costa Rica decided in 1965 to reopen a subject which had been discussed in the General Assembly many years before upon the request of Uruguay and France, concerning the creation of a body by means of a resolution of the Assembly which would be called upon to give impetus to the protection of human rights, a body which hitherto has not moved from the field of good intentions to that of achievements. Our interest in creating the office of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has been evident ever since the subject was introduced in 1965. During the twenty- fourth session of the General Assembly the subject was at last studied in substance. In resolution 2595 (XXIV) seventy three delegations voted in favor of giving the highest priority to the continuation of the study of this question, which now appears as item 46 on the agenda of this session. My delegation would view it with the greatest of satisfaction if we were able to reach a solution of that question and if an office were to be created as a manifestation of the interest of the United Nations in the protection of all human rights. That is why we hope that resolution 2595 (XXIV) will not be just one more resolution, but that its decisions will be taken with all due seriousness and that it will be given priority so that the question may be duly examined in the Committee concerned.
91.	Nothing runs more counter to the fundamental goal of the United Nations, which is the maintenance of peace and international security, than the absurd arms race which, year after year, consumes more than $200,000 million. Thus, general and complete disarmament under international control is becoming an evermore urgent task although the 'realists' of politics consider it merely Utopian.
92.	Costa Rica is proud to have unilaterally practiced complete and general disarmament since 1948. Since then we have not spent one cent on the maintenance of armed forces and we have entrusted our national defense against foreign aggression to existing international pacts and to the effectiveness of the regional and world organizations of which Costa Rica is a member. Our Constitution since 1949 proscribed the army as a permanent institution in our country. It is therefore not strange that my delegation should warmly support any measure tending towards a restriction in one way or another of the mad arms race.
93.	We understand the political reasons which prevent more efficient action in the field of disarmament. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Venezuela quite rightly described this state of affairs in the very excellent statement he made a few days ago. May I be allowed to quote some paragraphs of this admirable statement.
'We have already spoken of an international order based on the balance of power between the various blocs. The maintenance of this balance, precarious at best, requires the investment of gigantic sums of money for the acquisition of attack and defense systems which are increasingly complex and costly. The possession of the atomic bomb has been the point of departure in a constant arms race designed to end the balance of terror by some decisive discovery or by establishing the kind of material superiority which would have an unquestionable effect.
'With a very small percentage of the investments that are made for destruction, the fact of the earth could indeed be changed. However, the struggle for control of the world makes it impossible for the competitors to act in everyone's best interests ' [1841st meeting, paras. 102 and 103],
94.	Despite serious obstacles the Committee on Disarmament has worked untiringly in order to achieve at least collateral measures to decrease armaments. Very important measures have been achieved and are represented by treaties such as the Treaty on the partial prohibition of nuclear tests signed in 1963,  that which regulates the activities of States on the exploration and utilization of outer space signed in 1967 [resolution 2222 {XXI}], that which regulates the banning of nuclear weapons in Latin America (Tlatelolco Treaty), also signed in 1967, and the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons signed in 1968 [resolution 2373 (XXII)].
95.	We have subscribed fully to document A/7993 in which the inclusion of an item is requested in the provisional agenda of this twenty-fifth session, entitled 'Status of the implementation of General Assembly resolution 2456 B (XXIII) concerning the signature and ratification of additional protocol II of the treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlateloco)'. The purpose of this protocol is to commit the countries of Latin America to abstain from utilizing nuclear weapons on Latin American territory. Unfortunately, hitherto only the United Kingdom has adhered to the additional protocol II, thus showing its respect for the wish of our peoples to do away with nuclear weapons in this part of the globe. We are making an appeal to the othei world Powers to follow the British example.
96.	As the representative of a poor country, I must perforce regret the failure of the efforts of the United Nations to achieve the goals set by the First United Nations Development Decade. At the very time when we are about to discuss the strategy for the Second Decade, my delegation wishes to repeat the view that only a substantial reduction of military expenditure can enable the great Powers to free sufficient resources for them to collaborate in the raising of the standard of living of the nations which are still underdeveloped. Although we realize that various industrialized countries have repeated their intention to dedicate 1 per cent of their gross national .product to the development of the less favored areas, since wealth and natural resources are so very much concentrated in the hands of those States that are also foremost in the arms race, it would be Utopian to believe in an improvement of general conditions, relying only on the goodwill of those who are less powerful.
97.	Efforts towards achieving the objectives of the Second Development Decade must be closely linked with an effort to accelerate disarmament. Only thus will energies be able to be channeled energies which are today dedicated to the preparation of war towards general prosperity which, in reducing tension, would also reduce armed conflicts and render the arms race less necessary.
98.	Thanks, to a great extent, to the studies of the United Nations, we know today that two thirds of, mankind lives without proper food, without decent housing conditions, without land, without property, without health, and we know that the only solution to this tragedy consists in increasing the national income of the poor countries. But in order to increase that national income it is necessary to raise the level of production, and that can be achieved only by perfecting the methods of producing wealth, which are, in other words, education of the population in order to improve its technical and administrative knowledge, and the improvement cf the means of production, which implies the acquiring of modern agricultural and industrial machinery and equipment.
99.	But the education of populations and the creation of modern agricultural and industrial equipment requires enormous capital investments. And that is why our underdeveloped countries are caught in this vicious circle. Investments are insufficient because the national income is scarce. National savings are scarce because income is so slight. And thus it is not possible to invest in productive equipment and trained staff. Therefore this vicious circle can be broken only by means of considerable contribution of additional resources coming from the outside. Thus, it is evident that it is necessary to obtain the cooperation of the more developed countries, whose accumulation of wealth is due, to a large extent, to the exploitation of the poor countries.
100.	Although there are many ways and means in which the rich countries may cooperate in the development of the poor countries, my Government jointly believes that fhe most efficient manner to strengthen the economy of the underdeveloped countries is by paying a good price for their export products and by removing restrictions which are obstacles to their trade. In the economy of nations just as in the economy of individuals, the best means of raising the standard of living is by increasing their income by means of a fair payment for the work of each and every one.
101.	For thousands of years man lived only in a world of scarcity because he had no other energy for the process of production than the force of muscle of man or beast. Thus, for thousands of years the human mind was modeled on the assumption of scarcity, on the need to save to the extent of being avaricious, on the need for man to exploit his fellow citizens.
102.	But the tremendous development of modern technology has put an end to that situation of scarcity. Machines are working today untiringly and unerringly creating abundance. Nevertheless, man is still attached o the old routine of the voracious appropriation of
the belongings of others.
103.	The big economic crisis in 1929 had as its main cause, the constant increase in industrial production, which did not run par with an increase in salaries nor an increase in the prices of agricultural commodities. The Keynesian formula with which the crisis of the capitalist world was solved raised and stabilized the prices of agricultural products and increased industrial salaries. The measures thus adopted enabled the developed countries to overcome their crisis and to enrich the whole nation, far from ruining the urban and industrial populations.
104.	Therefore, internally, the industrialized nations have been obliged to adopt a system of distribution of wealth which is adapted to the new system of mass production. Thus, modern industry could not subsist unless it constantly increased the level of consumption of its own peoples. However, it has not been able to rid itself of this prejudice in the international field.
105.	The rich countries have thus stabilized the prices of their products at levels which represent a decent standard of living for their workers. Agricultural products are not exempt from this production. Wheat and sugar, for example, produced by the industrialized countries have good systems of stabilization of prices at a level of development. Only the poor peoples are obliged to sell the product of their work at a price which they can obtain on the 'free market'. And that, to a great extent, is why they are poor.
106.	At the beginning of the Second Development Decade we feel that the time has now come for the industrialized nations, which have already broken down the barrier of greed within their own domestic economy, to decide to break down that barrier within the world economy.
107.	The underdeveloped nations constitute the proletariat of today's world, and agricultural and mineral exports constitute their salary. Only by raising that salary will the poor nations be able to acquire the surplus of the industrial products which the rich nations need to sell in ever greater quantities on our markets. If the contrary occurs, once again due to a lack of equity in international trade, there will be serious economic crises such as those which occurred in the past because of a lack of a proper and fair distribution of national income.
108.	In concluding his statement in the general debate [1841st meeting] the representative of Brazil made a very simple proposal, which nevertheless, implies an entire program of action. Minister Gibson suggested, no more and no less, that we should utilize our Organization and that we should implement the Charter. Costa Rica, which is a founding Member of the United Nations, supports the Brazilian proposal with the greatest of faith and confidence.




"
25,1970,ECU,"71.  It had been my hope that a loftier personality would be presenting the greetings and congratulations of my Government to the President. Due to unforeseen circumstances I must do so, but I can assure him that what you may have lost in quality is made up for by the warm and sincerity of my feelings. Before meeting Ambassador Hambro I had occasion to know the very eminent Professor Hambro, whose rich doctrinal works many times channeled my hesitations and shed light on my doubts. When I met Ambassador Hambro I could appreciate his human qualities which combine wisdom with kindness. Now, on seeing President Hambro exercising his functions I have been able to see that the sum of his qualities as Professor, diplomat and man make him an outstanding leader who combines firmness with courtesy and a thorough knowledge of the rules of procedure, as well as an honest and energetic application of those rules, So it is that I extend to you, Mr. President, the greetings of my Government, but it is to the General Assembly that I address my congratulations for having elected you to preside over this important session.
72.	Before making the statement on behalf of my Government, I should also like to pay an affectionate tribute to our former President Mrs. Angie Brooks Randolph.
73.	May I request the delegation of the United Arab Republic to be so good as to accept the sincere condolences of my delegation, and my own, on the death of President Nasser? He was valiant in battle and an extraordinary statesman who undertook the difficult task of progressively modifying the social, economic and political structure of his nation, with the firmness of one who had the clear awareness that he was making history.
74.	I would also request the delegation of Malaysia to receive my condolences on the occasion of the passing away of Ambassador Ramani, a brilliant jurist, from whose enlightenment we, who had the honor of knowing him and having a cordial friendship with him, so often benefited.
75.	The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Mr. Schumann, in his statement in the general debate, when referring to the commemoration of the first quarter of a century of the United Nations, wondered whether it was not 'our duty to proceed to a certain examination of our consciences without hiding any truth' [1842nd meeting, para. 85].
76.	I believe that in such a necessary self-examination both optimism and pessimism are negative attitudes that optimism which considers that the Charter and the Organization it represents are perfect, as well as that pessimism which considers that the world Organization is a vast and painful failure because it has been unable to find a just balance between ends and means.
77.	Personally, I can peak with the experience of one who has lived through and attended fourteen of the twenty-five sessions of the General Assembly, and with the impartiality of one who represents a small State which has not been directly involved in the disputes which shook the Organization in its first twenty- five years.
78.	I shall start by pointing out certain basic facts. The first is that those in San Francisco who shaped the Charter had the immediate experience of the uselessness of the League of Nations as an instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security, since, despite the generous efforts of its leaders, it followed a system based on vn association of interests and was born of a war which was above all a European war although it did extend to c her continents a war of a Europe whose politics were based on the balance of power and the cold hardness of so-called political realism.
79.	The United Nations differs from the League in that it was born of a universal conflict, of a total war, which affected those who fought as well as the civilian population in almost every continent. Obviously, it was a war of interests colonial interests, for example but it was also a war of ideologies. It was natural that the Charter of the United Nations, which was born as an instrument for assuring peace and preserving future generations from the scourge of war, could not create a league of nations, but aspired to establish a community of peoples 'We the peoples of the United Nations', in the words of the Charter and which had to be based on universality, coexistence, nonintervention in the internal affairs of other States, and the equality of all States, large and small. It was for this reason, too, that it had to serve as a means to coordinate international cooperation in the economic, social, cultural and humanitarian fields.
80.	On arriving at the end of our first quarter of a century, we have to ask ourselves whether the Organization has discharged its essential duty of maintaining international peace and security. It is a positive fact that during these 25 years mankind has been spared the scourge of a total war, but as you, Mr. President, so brilliantly stated in your opening statement: 'But peace is not the mere absence of armed conflict' [1839th meeting, para 45]. It is obvious that the fictitious universal peace which we live in is, rather than an absence of conflict, the expression of a terrifying balance of the weapons of mass destruction, especially thermonuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles.

81.	The gradation of the number of dead is a tragic experience in the history of war. Until the last century, wars consisted of movements of armies with the purpose of occupying enemy territory. The First World War was a war of positions, of trenches, in which each kilometer which was won or lost meant a terrible harvest of death. The Second World War witnessed the mass destruction of populations behind the battle front, so as to break the enemy nations' economic power and will to struggle. A third world war would affect all of mankind and could not be won by any Power because it would have the return character of a boomerang, given the fact that its lethal power is as uncontrollable as it is universal. Until a few years ago nuclear power was calculated to be 100,000 megatons. Today this must have increased considerably. In explosive force, this means more than 100,000 million tons of TNT; but in lethal power it means much more than that, because the radioactive fallout would produce destructive effects at. distances of thousands of kilometers away.
82.	In the introduction to his annual report on the work of the Organization [A 1800HAdd. 1 and Corr.l] the SecretaryGeneral states that the military expenditure of the industrial countries for both nuclear and conventional armaments represents more than 85 per cent of the total world military expenditure, which now exceeds 200,000 million dollars a year.
83.	With regard to missiles, The New York Times of 23 November 1969, less than a year ago, indicated that the United States had 536 intercontinental ballistic missiles, 1,054 surface missiles and 655 submarine missiles, as compared to 150, 1,350 and 205 respectively for the Soviet Union. To this data we must add the fact that together with the single nuclear warhead of the Polaris type there are now multiple nuclear warheads, such as the Poseidon of the United States and the Soviet Union's SS9.
84.	This ultramodern version of what was once called 'armed peace' means that the former balance of power is today a balance of terror as well, and that one cannot seriously speak about the preservation of peace and security until one seriously takes up the problems of general and complete disarmament.
85.	As for the preservation of peace and security, it is an obvious fact that this has been achieved only in so far as the avoidance of universal conflict is concerned, while it has not been possible to prevent local wars or the new phenomenon of civil wars with international support.
86.	First it was Korea, whose remote origin was the questionable Moscow Treaty of 1945, concluded shortly after the signature of the United Nations Charter, which does not admit of the establishment of Trust Territories by States. The practical results were the division of an ancient country with its own culture into irreconcilable sectors.
87.	Later it was VietNam, that martyred land where the generation which today is thirty years old has not known a single day of peace. It is necessary that this unjust and cruel war be brought to an end and the VietNamese people be free to determine its own destiny.
88.	Finally, there is the Middle East, that cradle of cultures and religions, where peoples of the same ethnic quality, linked together by the interaction of religious and cultural traditions, are not able to find the means for the solution of their disputes, possibly because external pressures, the game of spheres of political influence and the hypocritical battle of the strategic interests of the great Powers keep the fires of discord alive.
89.	President Velasco Ibarra, the Head of State of Ecuador, has frequently and enthusiastically expressed his admiration for the Judaic people as an eternal spiritual force and his firm support for Israel regarding its need to be granted the right to a secure and recognized existence. My country, which has a long tradition of respect for the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes and international conflicts, considers it indispensable that a negotiated decision be reached within the letter and the spirit of the Charter. The SecretaryGeneral himself, U Thant, in his introduction to the annual report on the work of the Organization, spoke with realism about the need to start negotiations. He said:
'Only when the talks get under way and the parties begin to deal with substance will it become clear
whether they are prepared, in the interests of peace, to accept those compromises, and even to take what they believe to be those risks to their vital interests, which are the inescapable price for a peaceful settlement' /Ibid., para. 48].
90.	While the cruel battles waged among peoples of a geographical region which has contributed so much to human culture smite us with sorrow, it is also a source of sorrow that this battle has extended to non combatants who are taken as hostages.
91.	In itself, the idea of hostages is a survival of barbarism, because a human being is not a negotiable instrument but an end in himself. But how much more beyond justification is the concept of taking hostages, applied to noncombatants, to women and children from countries outside the conflict. Accordingly, I have instructions energetically to condemn the hijacking of aircraft, which endangers innocent human lives, and the capture of hostages. My delegation will support any measures to prevent these attempts and to punish those responsible.
92.	If in the preservation of international peace and security the shortcomings are visible, they are no less so when it comes to the application of the principle of universality, which is another of the cornerstones of our Organization.
93.	The universality of the Organization starts from the very fact, which previously had not been achieved, that the Charter imposes obligations not only on Member States but also on nonMember States. Since nonMember States are the subjects of obligations, they have correlative rights, the first of which is their access to the Organization, the only requirement being to comply with the obligations. Universality will not be achieved so long as there remain outside the Organization, because of the interplay of political interests, some States able to comply with their international obligations and so long as some peoples that are awaiting their freedom to be able to constitute themselves as sovereign States remain under the opprobrious colonial regime.
94.	The artificial concept of 'overseas provinces' can no longer be maintained the means whereby Portugal avoids fulfillment of the duties imposed on it by Chapter XI of the Charter. To the colonial war it wages there is only one acceptable solution, which is the granting of self-determination to the peoples of the Territories it administers. The permanent illegal action of South Africa in Namibia is an irritating mockery of the principles of the Charter, and the oppression of the illegal regime of Rhodesia over the Zimbabwe majorities is an opprobrium. We hope to see soon an active Members of this Organization Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau), Namibia and Zimbabwe.
95.	The principle of self-determination of peoples, in the meaning of their ability to give themselves their own Government, and nonintervention in the internal affairs of States, has also suffered serious defeats and contradictions. In what have been called Western democracies a short time ago the dangerous doctrine of the discipline of power came into being which was a restatement of the anachronistic Monroe doctrine, and it had been extended to Western Europe previously with what had been called the 'British Monroeism', contained in a note to the United States of 19 May 1928 regarding the BriandKellogg pact.  Brought up to modern times, it has found an echo outside the Western world. The political interventions in the Americas and Asia were followed by the reproachable ideological impositions by force on Eastern Europe. The danger of the doctrine of spheres of influence continues to be a threat to the principles of the Charter.
96.	The principle of peaceful coexistence and friendship among peoples with various systems has received a positive increment. Those of us who have lived in the United Nations during the asphyxiating days of the 'cold war' can today breathe the clearer air of coexistence. Nevertheless, coexistence and universality are correlative terms, and as long as the present situation persists regarding the People's Republic of China it can be affirmed that the divisions between the Eastern world and the Western world have shifted only in regard to geographical position, displacing further east the dividing line.
97.	Peaceful coexistence through a closer understanding between the superPowers carries with it the danger that, since both are industrial powers, their common interests might affect the 'third world'. It is interesting that, as there is a growing EastWest understanding, the divisions between the industrialized north and the developing south become deeper. An example of this has been the easy understanding between the industrial Powers without distinction of ideology regarding an immediate limitation of the territorial waters and the prudent attitude of the developing countries, which, in general, believe it is preferable to deal with this problem in connexion with all problems of the sea, including the prior establishment of an international regime and the machinery applicable to the exploration and exploitation of the seabed an ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.
98.	Latin America has a long legal tradition in regard to maritime domain. The Foreign Minister of Colombia quoted [1846th meeting] one of the Principles of Mexico of 1956, namely, that an extension of the territorial sea is not a standard of international law. I should like to recall another of the 1956 Mexico Principles, which is the recognition of the right of each State to set the extent of its jurisdiction over its waters in accordance with its geographical and geological characteristics, and the interests of its population, up to reasonable limits. This right was recognized to some extent in the Tlatelolco Treaty  and it was reiterated in Lima last August, with the support of almost all the Latin American countries, including that of the sister Republic of Colombia. At that meeting too we
reiterated the concept of the continental shelf, which came into being in the capital of the Dominican Republic in 1956, was incorporated in the Geneva Convention of 1958, and is totally contrary to the proposal made by President Nixon on the seabed.
99.	At the meeting of nonaligned States held a few days ago in Lusaka,  which Ecuador attended as an observer, it was affirmed that they committed themselves to exercise their right fully and carry out their obligations to achieve the development and wellbeing of their peoples through maximum utilization of the natural resources existing on their territories and in the adjacent waters.
100.	The fact that disagreements have become more acute between the developed north and the developing south, following the breadth (width) parallels, tends to displace to a secondary level the political differences that exist throughout the length of the meridians. The development targets set for the first Development Decade are far from having been attained. Injustices in the terms of trade have become more serious, and the assistance of the developed countries often becomes a mockery, because many of the millions received in aid returns, in the form of interest payments, dividends and acquisitions.
101.	An important political consequence is the crisis of representative democracy. As long as the dispossessed masses of the developing countries cannot achieve high economic and cultural levels, representative democracy will increasingly be a benefit for privileged minorities. A political democracy without
' economic democratization is but a word placed in an empty container. And the growing advance of new national concepts which break away with violence from the forms of representative democracy should be a warning to those who maintain peoples over whom they would wish to exercise political hegemony in conditions of underdevelopment.
102.	I would not wish this review to appear to be a catalog of frustrations. It is an easy matter to charge to the Organization the mistakes of others as a scapegoat is blamed for sins it is innocent of. More is required of the Organization than it can give within its constitutional limitations.
103.	In the first place, the Organization is not a superState, nor is the General Assembly a world parliament. And the Security Council is far from being an executive power and the International Court of Justice a binding legal organ. And yet one frequently calls on the Organization to act as though it were a superState. The United Nations originally comprised only the nations which, united, won the war. There are well-known relics of this in the Charter, for example, Articles 53, 77 and 107, which maintain the concept of 'enemy States'.
104.	Although the idealistic intention of the creators of the Charter was to constitute a community of nations, the Charter preserves formulas relating to
power politics such as the veto, enshrined in Article 27, through the principle of the unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council and the veiled veto which Articles 108 and 109 grant them as regards amendments to the Charter.
105.	The tendency of some great Powers to maintain the exclusive and excluding character of the Security Council in matters pertaining to peace is yet another vestige of the survival of power politics because the Charter has given the Security Council alone primary or paramount responsibility, granted by the Members, that is to say, by the General Assembly.
106.	Those constitutional factors have frequently paralyzed Council action, which has gone from the systematic veto to the inoperative method of innocuous consensus. We shall refer to this point when we discuss the strengthening of international peace and security in the First Committee.
107.	Another factor which paralyzes action is derived from the arbitrary interpretation given by some great Powers to peacekeeping operations. The creation of peacekeeping forces able to act quickly in accordance, with Chapter VII of the Charter is a premise without which all the resolutions of the Security Council will be mere academic exercises.
108.	Another effective advisable means would be the establishment of a group of experts capable of being moved to areas where disputes occur or situations which are likely to endanger international peace and security. That idea, which some years ago was generously put forward by the Netherlands, could be reexamined and brought back to life.
109.	I referred earlier to failures in regard to the principle of universality. And yet it must be recalled that in 1946 only fifty-one States were Members of the Organization. In 1955, sixteen States were added after a lengthy interval. When the commemorative period starts there will possibly be 127 Member States. The constant struggle of the countries of the third world has won major victories in the field of decolonization, and we are confident that that struggle will continue.
110.	As regards the principle of universality, I must state that it does not consist solely in admitting new Member States, but, above all, in the universal agreement that the Charter is a multilateral treaty whereby Member States have agreed to place part of their internal jurisdiction under international jurisdiction. Therefore, my delegation deems to be dangerous the tendency to consider that regional agreements and systems have a primary role in problems of peace and security. If Africa or Latin America were to lock themselves up in their regional systems and that tendency were to extend to other continents, there would be no reason for the United Nations to exist. Regional systems, which are extremely valuable in the fields of economic, social, cultural and political cooperation, are means for the solution of regional conflicts under the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, which is the primary organ for the maintenance of international peace and security. However, regional organizations cannot be invoked as having binding and exclusive jurisdiction.
111.	Summarizing the above, it would seem that the United Nations, not having the means of enforcement of a superState, would have to reduce its role to a tedious forum of speakers. But it is evident that the United Nations Charter has given the Organization dynamic elements which can make it more perfect even without the need for specific amendments.
112.	The fact that the Organization lacks the enforcement means that a superState might have does not detract from, but rather strengthens, its role as an organ of international public opinion. This is a fact which responds not only to technological advances but also to the community feeling which becomes stronger and more binding.
113.	The pressure of public opinion, which the United Nations represents has permitted not only the strengthening of peaceful coexistence but also that of cooperation, which produced fortunate achievements such as the Moscow Treaty on nuclear tests, signed in 1963, which we hope will be completed with the elimination of underground testing and will become universal with its acceptance by all nuclear Powers; the Treaty on the prohibition of the use of outer space for the placement of weapons of mass destruction signed in 1967 [see resolution 2222 (XXI)j; the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, signed in 1968 [resolution 2373 (XXII)], which we hope will be perfected and become universally valid; and the Tlatelolco Treaty, whose protocol of guarantee is still awaiting the signature of all the nuclear Powers. Thus, the United Nations is increasingly being transformed into what you, Mr. President, in your work written in collaboration with Professor Goodrich, called 'the open conscience of mankind'.
114.	Also as an organ of international public opinion the United Nations discharges the duty of concentrating world attention on the faithful observance of human rights. The struggle against discrimination for reasons of race, sex, nationality or religion is being transformed into organic bodies of doctrine and legally binding covenants. It is true that to the shame of mankind and as a perpetual violation of the Charter, apartheid exists as a State doctrine in South Africa and the Southern Rhodesia of jian Smith; but it is true too that in other parts of the world racism has become an illegal and punishable practice.
115.	The United Nations has served as the center of opinion in other important matters, among which I shall only mention the initiative taken by Sweden on the problems of the human environment. Man is perhaps the only animal which destroys the environment surrounding him: the air, the water and the land. Through science and technology man has acquired dominion over nature, but he has forgotten that he himself is a limited animal being who, as Professor Rene Dubos of Rockefeller University told us, 'can live only so long as he maintains and creates around
him a micro-habitat similar to the one in which he became what he is'. This necessity to conserve the biosphere is one of the most urgent problems and the very basis of our own survival.
116.	I shall end my statement with an inevitable conclusion which was pointed out this morning by the representative of Argentina: the United Nations can be no more than what its Members large, medium and small wish it to be. But whatever may be the differences regarding the aims and the means to achieve them, there are four essential principles which can be mentioned as being universally accepted.
117.	The first is that war can no longer be a means to create, alter or eliminate rights. That principle, which was incorporated in the Charter as a preexisting mandatory standard, is the only one which can restore to a world of conflicts a feeling of security, which is the condition for peace. To this end it is necessary to develop and improve more complete systems for the peaceful settlement of disputes, to condemn aggression and the ignoring of territorial conquests obtained through threats or the use of force. Since its creation as a State, Ecuador has maintained a constant respect for the principle of uti possidetis jure, which has served in Latin America as the source for the creation of nationalities on the basis not only of territorial captaincies-general and vice-regencies but also on the basis of what was decided at the Court of Appeal audiences.
118.	The second principle is that peace and security, at a time of historical crisis, such as the one we are living through, are linked to the peaceful coexistence of sometimes opposite political systems. The division of the world into spheres of influence leads to the negation of the basis principles of coexistence which are: respect for political self-determination; nonintervention in internal affairs; and equality of States large and small.
i 19. The third principle is universality, which is the source of the idea of an international community, which the United Nations aspires to be. That requires an open-door policy and the liberation of colonial peoples and countries.
120. The fourth, and last, principle is that loyal cooperation in the economic sphere is indispensable to lessen the gap between development and underdevelopment. That which I have called international public opinion in politics corresponds to that which, in the economic field, President Caldera of Venezuela has called international social justice. It must not be forgotten that most of the developing countries have lived through colonial regimes, the metropolis of which in each case built its present economic power at the expense of the exploitation of the colonial people. We are now celebrating the first decade of political decolonization. We hope that the next decade, which will be simultaneous with the Development Decade, will consider making a start in the struggle against economic colonialism. The peace of the slave prisons was created by the wealth of a few being based on
the pauperization of the many, but this will not lead to peace with justice, to which all peoples of the world aspire.
121.	The fact that the Organization cannot be more than the will of its Members permit it to be, creates great responsibilities. It is in our hands to make of the United Nations a community organized for the fulfillment of the noble principles and purposes of the Charter or a series of peoples subject to the omnipotent will of the armed superPowers; a world of freedom or one of obedience, of justice or of arbitrariness, of wellbeing or of poverty. It is my hope that when our work is judged in a historical projection it will be found that we have done our duty.




"
25,1970,CMR,": A year ago I came here as the Acting President of the Organization of African Unity to put before the Assembly [1780th meeting], on behalf of that regional organization, the Manifesto on Southern Africa,  and the Assembly was good enough to give the moral support of the highest international body to that document. Today it is on behalf of the Federal Republic of Cameroon that I have accepted the invitation of the SecretaryGeneral and I have already expressed my esteem for him to address this august Assembly again and to participate in its work. I regret that I shall not be able to be present at the solemn ceremonies planned for this session and nor for the collective stocktaking which the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization of the United Nations calls for.
3.	Perhaps I may be allowed, first of all, to address my warmest congratulations to the IPresident of the General Assembly for the trust that he has earned from the Assembly. That trust is doubtless at one and the same time a tribute to his eminent qualifications and a tribute to the valuable contribution of his country to the life of our Organization and international community in general.
4.	The United Nations was founded twenty-five years ago, at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, at the end of the most ghastly cataclysm in the history of man. This anniversary is particularly moving since behind it we see the shadows of tens of millions of men who sacrificed their lives for the victory of
the forces of freedom and progress over the barbarous forces of Nazism, militarism and racism which threatened to annihilate everything that was democratic and human in the world.
5.	The United Nations was founded to carry out the ideal that evoked that generous and courageous sacrifice in order to promote a better world, freed from violence, injustice and misery.
6.	That ideal was set forth in the United Nations Charter, signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, which defined the purposes of the Organization as follows: to maintain international peace and security; to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self determination of peoples; to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights arid for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion; and to be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.
7.	To celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations means, in fact, to ask ourselves whether the sacrifice of those millions of men was worth while; if their hopes, which are still our own, have been achieved or shattered.
8.	When, after a quarter of a century of existence, we draw up the balance sheet of the road traveled and the results achieved by the Organization, we come to the conclusion that during that period during which international relations have changed often, profoundly, and at times so tumultuously, this Organization has achieved a series of significant results but also shown a number of weaknesses.
9.	The United Nations has many and varied achievements to its credit. However, before we define them let us say that the most important success achieved by our Organization, as an Organization of independent States with equal rights, is that it is still alive and struggling actively to solve the many problems which confront the world.
10.	In a world that has undergone so many changes, that has confronted so many new phenomena from decolonization to the appearance of nuclear weapons and the conquest of outer space a world that has been a prey to ideological confrontations, the cold war and armed conflicts, the United Nations has been a body which, above and beyond the inevitable divisions, has
endeavored to be a factor of conciliation and stability in international relations, to express the hopes and aspirations of all mankind regarding the establishment of a lasting peace based on equal rights and the development of all Members of the community of nations, regardless of their size, their military power or their economic potential.
11.	To define the point more clearly, let us add that, in the light of what I have said, the United Nations has become a necessary element in international relations to the point where it would be difficult for contemporary man, hereafter, to imagine international life without the existence of such a universal Organization.
12.	The Organization by its presence and its activities has succeeded in imposing the idea of an institutionalized international community. We must say that it has been aided in this by the very evolution of the international society. The world community, in fact, has achieved a degree of advanced development which is reflected in the scope and diversity of relations among peoples, in the interdependence and the mutuality of interests, in the requirements and the objective needs of cooperation dictated by technological progress and, finally, in the very evolution and growth of international awareness, so that the organization of this world now has become an unchallengeable need.
13.	To return to the credit side of the Organization, it is almost a duty for the Head of State of an African country, formerly under trusteeship, on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, to stress the particularly positive role that the United Nations has played and continues to play by giving constant and effective support to the struggle of peoples for liberation.
14.	Entire continents have been freed from colonial domination. The entry into the United Nations of a large number of newly independent countries has profoundly modified the structure and significance of the Organization and has led it to take the initiative of establishing a vast program of assistance to the developing countries in order to strengthen their political sovereignty, their economic emancipation and to establish a veritable universal strategy for development.
15.	That fact highlights another positive aspect of United Nations activities: it has kept alive the feeling of human solidarity and implemented international cooperation through its specialized agencies, particularly those that deal with technical assistance, health, agriculture, food, education, science, culture and communications. The effectiveness of these agencies cannot be gainsaid and their importance lies not only in the practical usefulness of their activities, but also in the fact that, thanks to them, the United Nations is a living reality in the daily life of all the Member States.
16.	Finally, we should note the role of the Organization as a world parliament. Basing itself on the Charter, the Organization has thus established worldwide legislation of great scope and thereby created a new international law: the Law of the United Nations. In this regard we might recall the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [resolution 217 A (III)], which has set up as an international standard the elementary and democratic rights of the individual; decisions on international economic assistance, which lay down the principle that hunger and poverty in the world must be the concern of the entire international community; the Declarations on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)] and on the elimination of racism all over the world [resolution 1904 (XVII1)]\ the resolution on the permanent sovereignty of States over their natural resources [1803 (XVII)], which opens the door to a new branch of international law, that of the economic aspects of the sovereignty of peoples; and the resolution on nuclear weapons, under which the use of such weapons is regarded as a crime against humanity [1653 (XVI)]. And there are others.
17.	This new law has already laid the groundwork for the new international society, to which we aspire today. This is indeed the main role of the law: it does not only reflect existing situations; it also foreshadows the ideal towards which the mind of man must aspire and human relations be bent.
18.	Together with that positive side, if I may say so, there is a.negative side to the activities of the United Nations which is of equal importance.
19.	In this field the most disturbing factor is that the United Nations which in many respects is an effective international legislator, a body where the principles of international conduct are laid down has not always been able, to put it no more strongly, to exercise a sufficient influence on the conduct of Member States when such conduct has been contradictory to the principles and the spirit of the Charter; in other words, contradictory to the obvious interests of the international community.
20.	Nor does the Organization seem to be adequately equipped effectively to face those phenomena which are unanimously considered to be the most disastrous of the modern world. This applies to the ever widening gap which, despite the material and scientific resources available, separates the different regions of the world in economic development, and which the efforts within the framework of the First United Nations Development Decade were unable to bridge. We trust that the Second Development Decade will contribute effectively to avoiding a widening of the gap, if not to bridging it.
21.	The same applies to the arms race among the most developed countries at the risk of annihilating mankind, and which absorbs far greater resources than those needed to speed up the development of the developing countries.
22.	The same applies, finally, to the resort to force in international relations, to armed conflicts, aggressions, interferences, and interventions of a brutal nature in the internal affairs of other countries, which we note in the world and which make obvious the inability of the Organization to maintain international peace and security, which, according to the terms of the Charter, is its primary responsibility.
23.	The weaknesses that the United Nations has shown in the face of these events must profoundly affect the faith of peoples in the world Organization and its future. This explains why for a number of years, the question of reviewing the system of the United Nations has been raised.
24.	Doubtless a more reasonable utilization of the immense machinery of the United Nations would contribute to improving the effectiveness of the Organization. In fact the United Nations has, at times successfully, extended its activities to many fields. This has increased the complexity of its administrative machinery, which in turn yields greater results.
25.	Naturally, a certain selectivity, a more realistic orientation and a better coordination of the entire system would increase the effectiveness of the United Nations in the carrying out of the daily tasks and functions which are now part and parcel of its role and its place in international relations.
26.	There can be no doubt, furthermore, that certain United Nations bodies would gain by being adapted in order for the Organization better to reflect the transformations that have occurred in the composition and aims of the international society.
27.	However, it would be wrong to seek the cause of the weaknesses of the United Nations in the useless ness or obsolescence of the principles of the Charter which we feel still to be fully valid today or in flaws in its structure. Certain campaigns for the revision of the Charter have often scant connexion with the desire to increase the importance and effectiveness of the United Nations. They show their true political colours v/ Hen 9 for example, they even suggest a weighted vote, thus challenging the principle of the sovereign equality of States without which no international society worthy of the name could exist. We believe that those campaigns have only one aim, and that is to show, a con trario, that international society, in spite of its imperfections, is only what it is today thanks to the existence of the United Nations.
28.	In fact, without denying the weaknesses of our Organization, which are evident, we must recognize that we often deal with it unfairly. At the present stage of international law and relations, even though institutions can be improved, it is hard to believe that a men* technical and legal revision could eliminate all the causes of its impotence or increase its strength.
29.	We must recognize that the impotence of the United Nations is basically due to the strength of national egotisms, that is to say, the lack of political will which the Members of the United Nations often show when, contrary to their own specific interests, they are called upon to implement the resolutions of the Organization and to take appropriate measures against those that commit aggression or violate elementary human rights or the rights of peoples.
30.	How else are we to understand the fact that, despite the pertinent decisions of the United Nations, the racist minorities of Pretoria and Salisbury continue to practice the policy of apartheid and defy international opinion with impunity? Or that South Africa obstinately refuses to apply the decisions of the United Nations on Namibia? Or that African Territories, on this tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, still suffer under the colonial domination of Portugal? Or that peace is still jeopardized or threatened in one way or another in the world?
31.	It is clear that nothing significant can be done in the United Nations, and that the Disarmament Decade, the Development Decade and our resolutions on decolonization, regardless of their importance, cannot save the United Nations from the stagnation which threatens it, without the political will. The salvation of the United Nations without doubt resides in respect for the Charter of the Organization and in the scrupulous observance by all Member States of its fundamental principles, which continue to inspire the world and the youth of the world, as the World Youth Assembly made clear. Obviously this implies that the great Powers must loyally and truly assume the obligations incumbent upon them as permanent members of the Security Council. But perhaps this salvation resides even more in the awareness and determination of the small countries of the Third World, which now more than ever need an organized international community to guarantee their security and their development.
32.	The positive evolution which the United Nations has undergone in many fields in the course of the past twenty-five years has to a large extent been the result of their persevering action. There can be no doubt that the future of the Organization will also depend on its ability to formulate and ensure the aspirations and needs of mankind it represents. Therefore it is not surprising that the Conference of NonAligned Countries was held in Lusaka on the eve of this important session,  and pledged its total support to the United Nations and the strengthening of its role in decolonization, the defense of human rights, peace, cooperation and the progress of peoples. But by the same token, certain general conditions must, nevertheless, be fulfilled in order to ensure full effectiveness. I have in mind the complete universality of the United Nations, which the evolution of events makes more and more necessary.
33.	I have in mind also the general democratization of the work of the United Nations and of international relations in general. The road that leads to that end passes through concerted action in which all must actively participate. The result to be obtained is the creation of relations that will allow each people to work for its own future without hindrance and without interference and to contribute according to its means to the promotion of peace and the achievement of a world civilization whose material and technical bases have already been laid. There can be no doubt that it is this key that will open wide the door to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in the world, because it is this democratization that is the order of the day. It is this democratization that must be our main concern as we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations.
34.	This world of ours is more and more a unified world, a world that more and more stresses our community of destiny. It is for us to become aware of this objective solidarity and this community of destiny. In other words, we must be profoundly and sincerely convinced of the fraternity of all men and of the fact that their common future in this universe cannot validly be created except in the free and equitable cooperation of all men, all nations and all peoples.
35.	Thus we go back to the fundamental theme of peace, justice and progress which we have chosen for this commemorative session of the Organization and which is our profound hope for the future of the world. It is in our loyalty to these principles, which simply sum up those of the Charter, that the strengthening of the United Nations lies, together with their ultimate establishment as the main and irreplaceable instrument for a better future for all mankind.

"
25,1970,THA,"65.	Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to convey to you on behalf of the delegation of Thailand warm and sincere congratulations on your election to the Presidency of the twenty- fifth session of the General Assembly. The close and friendly relations that my country has traditionally enjoyed with your great country are an additional source of gratification, and we have no doubt that your rich experience and perceptive mind will guide us through our deliberations to a happy and successful conclusion. We are also mindful of the fact that you bear a name which was illustrious in the annals of the body that preceded the United Nations the League of Nations. The honor that the General Assembly bestowed upon you is therefore all the more significant, and our best wishes go to you in discharging your new responsibility and in upholding the distinguished family tradition.
66.	I should also like to extend our deep appreciation to my good friend, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph, the outgoing President of the General Assembly. Her Presidency was marked by her firm yet cheerful attitude. Her deep convictions and faith in the United Nations also made her a very effective and eloquent spokesman for the world Organization during her tenure of office.
67.	It is not often that a United Nations General Assembly session is convened with even some faint rays of hope piercing through layers of clouds overhanging the dark sky. But the tragic civil war in Nigeria has now been brought to an end. In Europe hopeful signs of greater calm and relaxation have appeared over the horizon. The United Nations, on its way to celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of its foundation, should be thankful for whatever modest change there may be in circumstances, from continuing crises and widespread conflict to an improvement in the understanding and relationships among major European Powers. It is true that peace has not been restored in all parts of the globe, nor has it been firmly secured in places where clashes and conflicts have been a daily routine. In the Middle East soldiers still remain with their loaded guns in the trenches and bunkers along the Suez Canal, but at least a ceasefire has been more or less observed by the parties most concerned. However, guerrilla activities, including hijackings and the destruction of civil aircraft, as well as the detention of innocent passengers, and lately the fierce fighting in Jordan, mar the prospects of peace in that highly explosive area.
68.	No doubt these rays of hope are only a beginning, but a beginning to which we have not been accustomed for quite a long while. Therefore, those who have contributed to bringing about this more encouraging state of affairs should be congratulated and supported in their worthwhile efforts towards a notable lessening of international tension. The United States should be commended for proposing and urging a ceasefire in the Middle East; so should the parties which have accepted it, namely the United Arab Republic, Jordan and Israel, as weU as the United Nations mediator, Mr. Gunnar Jarring, who has been working so patiently for peace in that troubled part of the world.
69.	In Europe, the treaty which the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union have recently concluded,  by which the parties agreed to renounce all resort to force and to recognize and respect the present borders of Germany, has cleared the atmosphere of Europe of the immediate threats of conflict and has brought along with it cleaner air, an air of detente and peaceful coexistence. There again, the responsible parties should be commended for their successful efforts to rid the world of a major cause of confrontation and hostility. What can and will be done to consolidate this initial gain remains to be seen, but at least the nations concerned can pursue their task of pacification and of anchoring the peace firmly in the European continent in more relaxed surroundings without the pressure of propaganda and its accompanying charges and countercharges.
70.	Only in Asia and more particularly in SouthEast Asia do the skies remain ominously dark with incessant fighting, killing and destruction. The invading hordes of North VietNam and their clients, the Viet Cong, continue to maim, terrorize and slaughter innocent men and women along the breadth and length of SouthEast Asia, from the Kingdom of Laos to Cambodia and South VietNam. In their ruthless enterprises they were and still are supported by and supplied with economic means and destructive weapons by their sponsors in Asia and Eastern Europe. That is why, at the urgent request of the victims of aggression, forces from the United States, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Thailand, much against their desire for peace, had to rush to the rescue. Otherwise the subjection of small nations would have been consummated and their free and sovereign existence would have been wiped out. At the present time, although the likelihood of the aggressors imposing their will and their military solution on their victims has become more remote, the former, bred in their intransigent imperialistic traditions, continue to inflict sufferings and depredations upon millions of people yearning for peace and tranquility.
71.	One may wonder why while elsewhere in the world, in the Middle East and in Europe, people have grown tired and wearied of conflicts and fighting the Marxists in Asia never have enough of terrorizing and burning and murdering, and why their thirst for conquest and domination is so far unquenchable. While on the defending side one nation after another first the United States then Australia, New Zealand and Thailand has declared its readiness to withdraw its forces from the theater of war, the other side has shown no sign of relenting in its belligerent attitude. Instead they have stepped up hostilities in Laos, in Cambodia and also in the northern part of South VietNam. Was it, one may ask, because the free world side had shown signs of compromise that they mistook for weakness and even surrender? That seems to be the only plausible reason which can explain the unyielding attitude they have invariably adopted at the Paris negotiations.
72.	If one attempts to draw a comparison between what occurs in Europe and the Middle East and what obtains in SouthEast Asia as one should try to learn from experiences in other parts of the world a striking conclusion readily emerges. The situation in Europe and the Middle East reflects what courteous diplomatic language may call the 'desire for peace', but the hard realities of international life may more simply term it a 'power stalemate'. The existence of the massive strength both nuclear and conventional of NATO and the Warsaw Pact in Europe and the might of the Soviet Union and the might of the United States in the Middle East confronting each other have resulted in this de facto stalemate which, if broken would undoubtedly lead to a catastrophe of major proportions and result in an indescribable holocaust for all those who may become, involved. In these circumstances victory has little if any meaning and its cost may be too exorbitant for anyone to hope to reach it.
73.	Such a situation, unfortunately, has not yet developed in our part of the world, or at least not to the extent to which it prevails in the above mentioned two areas. The regimes of Peking, Hanoi and Pyongyang still possess dominant military might, especially in the conventional field, and outside Powers who may be a match for them are not inclined to confront them unless it becomes a nuclear confrontation, which nobody wants anyhow. That is why those Asian Marxists continue to push implicitly or otherwise for a military solution even if it means a widening of the conflict as we have seen recently in Laos and Cambodia. They must indeed feel grateful to all those who keep reciting the litany that no military solution is possible in VietNam or even in the whole of SouthEast Asia. Such an exhortation suits the invaders very well, for the last thing they want is to have the defending side put up military opposition. They very much prefer to be allowed to pursue their own military objectives. At the same time they are tenaciously pressing for the acceptance of their formula for a political surrendei, the latest version of which they put forward only last week in Paris.
74.	While one has to admit that the withdrawal of various defending forces will not help create a power stalemate like the one which obtains in other parts of the world, it is meant at least as far as my country is concerned to show how desirous and eager we are to strive for a political settlement rather than one based on the use of force. However, since the other side continues to be recalcitrant other approaches have to be explored. Since a military stalemate is not realizable in SouthEast Asia one has to look for a political stalemate, a modest step towards which was initiated by the Asian and Pacific nations congregating at Djakarta a few months ago.  It was regrettable that this assemblage was not strong enough to produce tangible results because it lacked the necessary ingredient of power even political power which could create the kind of stalemate that would ultimately lead to negotiations or a possible political modus vivendi for peaceful coexistence. To have any chance of success there must be an accrual of more weighty States to restore the balance. The participation of the four major Powers or, failing that, of the two great Powers on the same side will more certainly ensure success and make possible a prospect of meaningful negotiations and eventual settlement. That undoubtedly is the optimum. How it can be brought about is perhaps the greatest and most difficult problem of our time, which no person of goodwill should brush aside without giving it a thought or even a try.
75.	In the first place the suggestion that France and the United Kingdom should be urged to play a role in Asia, for instance in helping resolve the Cambodian question, is both logical and realistic, in our opinion. For one thing both countries have had long and intimate relations and experience with our part of the world. France, in particular, was until recently an Administering Authority in IndoChina, and the United Kingdom, for its part, is currently a co-chairman of the Geneva Conference. The two countries are therefore aptly suited to play a worthy part in dealing with problems facing SouthEast Asia.
76.	As to the two world Powers, they have been and still are backing their respective side in the present conflict. If both of them could find a basis for an agreement, the fighting would grind to a prompt stop. A ceasefire could then be declared and negotiations started. At the present time the talks in Paris are not moving ahead because only one sport-soring Power sits at the conference table while the other conveniently stays outside and continues to pull the strings without being exposed or committed to any course of compromise or any proposal for a giveandtake. That is undoubtedly a miscalculation brought about by a hasty decision inspired perhaps by the internal political requirements of the moment rather than by rational considerations. In our opinion, as long as this disadvantageous^ unbalanced composition persists it would be unrealistic to expect any worthwhile breakthrough or progress at the Paris talks. If the truth of this is now realized, efforts must be made to repair the said shortcoming. The solution of inviting the Powers which, as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, are entrusted with the main responsibility of
'Conference of Foreign Ministers of Asian and Pacific countries held on 16 and 17 May 1970.
ensuring and maintaining world peace is a reasonable way out of the present procrastination and stagnation in the efforts to restore peace and tranquility in SouthEast Asia.
77.	The question of the representation of China in the United Nations will undoubtedly come up for discussion again this year. The position of the Government of Thailand on this matter remains unchanged. Without going into the merits or demerits of the case, it is our firm conviction that the Republic of China, a founding Member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council, is entitled to continue to represent the Chinese people as it has done since the inception of the United Nations. Furthermore, in our view, the question of representation is one which should be left to the Chinese people itself and any settlement of the issue should be the responsibility of the two contending parties. No initiatives or measures taken by Member States of the United Nations can be expected to yield satisfactory results. Nor can any solution or formula devised by others be expected to gain the acceptance of the rival parties.
78.	Concerning the question of disarmament, the world has grappled with this problem for a time far in excess of the age of the United Nations. For obvious reasons the problem has been an elusive one, but international efforts persist and the United Nations has been in. the forefront in trying to devise measures for arms control. Its accomplishments have been notable but limited, and some loopholes remain evident. For instance, the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] does not cope with the horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the world still anxiously awaits a successful outcome of the strategic arms limitation talks between the two nuclear Powers. Moreover, adequate security guarantees for nonnuclear States are lacking. The partial test-ban Treaty  in order to be effective needs the adherence of other nuclear Powers and should be enlarged to cover all environments.
79.	On the other hand, in the quarter century that the United Nations has existed, the world body has spent an unconscionable time in debates on the kind of weaponry that is less likely to be employed. It has not dealt enough with conventional armaments which are being used every day of the year in all parts of the world for destructive purposes and which could easily spark a widespread conflagration. This is one aspect of arms control that should be pondered more seriously and energetically during the present United Nations Disarmament Decade.
80.	Considering the present international requirements, the peacekeeping responsibility of the United Nations must of necessity continue to be one of the main pillars of the work of this Organization. Without the effective functioning of this important aspect of United Nations activities, international peace and security are in great jeopardy. It is therefore regrettable that the progress made in the course of the past year in the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations has been slower than it was the year before. It has often been claimed that the problem is highly complex and that the differences are of so fundamental a nature that negotiations are bound to be time consuming. While no one could have expected rapid progress in the work of the Committee, it was nevertheless the hope of all that after the introduction of the first report of the working group last year some meaningful results might be forthcoming.
81.	We would like to urge the General Assembly to install a renewed sense of urgency in the work of the Committee and, in particular, in the negotiations in the working group, and efforts to reach a compromise must be further intensified.
82.	The conscience of mankind continues to be assaulted by the racist policies of apartheid. The United Nations has for all these years been calling upon the responsible party to desist from these unjust and repugnant policies which arc in clear violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.
83.	This deplorable state of affairs does not redound to the credit or effectiveness of the world Organization. The international community looks for decisive action to the United Nations as well as to those major trading partners that are in a position to influence the thinking of the Governments concerned.
84.	The question of violations by some Member Governments of the arms embargo called for in a series of Security Council resolutions is undoubtedly a matter of grave concern. There is therefore a need to strengthen the arms embargo and the Security Council was wise to adopt resolution 282 (1970) of 23 July 1970, calling upon all States to take measures towards that end. The implementation of that resolution will, in our opinion, lessen the danger of violent conflict in southern Africa.
85.	Suppression of the inalienable rights and freedoms of the oppressed peoples in southern Africa has remained unabated. The inhumane policy of apartheid was extended to the international Territory of Namibia, and the illegal minority regime in Southern Rhodesia felt encouraged and continued to defy the United Nations resolutions as well as world public opinion.
86.	The United Nations, in our opinion, has a worthy record in decolonization activity. Since 1945 no fewer than forty-five Territories have gained independence, and yet when we are about to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples the momentum that the world Organization has generated in the past two decades seems to be withering away. Let us hope that the 1970s will bring a greater determination by the vast majority of Member States and the subjected peoples to erase, once and for all, the remaining vestiges of colonialism in Africa and other parts of the world. Let us also hope that the colonial Powers and their major trading partners will become aware of the archaic nature of apartheid and colonialism, and that they will show political wisdom in recognizing the inherent right of self-determination for the peoples in the colonial Territories.
87.	Recent events on the international scene have given clear indications of a trend which, if allowed to go unchecked, leads towards the law of the jungle. It is therefore imperative that the peoples of the United Nations reaffirm their strict observance of the principles and provisions of the Charter and their respect for international law and justice. While the Thai Government has appreciated and welcomed the unremitting efforts of the United Nations in codifying and developing international law in many fields, it is regrettable that recourse to international law and justice has not been the standard practice of nations.
88.	My delegation feels that greater advantage should be taken of the International Court of Justice as in the recent action of the Security Council, when it exercised its competence to seek an advisory opinion on the legal consequences for States of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia.
89.	There are, of course, various other modes available for the settlement of disputes by peaceful means as specified by Article 33 of the Charter. Member nations should therefore be persuaded to comply with their obligation under Article 33 and to have recourse to such means in the future. Resort to the good offices of the SecretaryGeneral should likewise be encouraged.
90.	As is well known to all, the United Nations was brought into existence on the premise of the practicability of the concept of one world. This one world concept requires a new, positive attitude towards trade and development, a new commitment to assistance and new economic and social structures. These can be brought about with success only through the genuine display of political will, international understanding and mutual cooperation between the developed and the developing countries. In the recent past these two groups of countries have had occasion to discuss these matters, particularly at sessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and other bodies of the United Nations, but, unfortunately, such a dialog has too often degenerated into a deadlock, if not confrontation.
91.	It should also be observed that many items like shipping, insurance and reinsurance and tourism account for a very large share of the balance of payments of developing countries. However, for various reasons, the earnings of these countries from such items continue to remain negligible. The share of the developing countries in the world merchant fleet is less than 7 per cent. Similarly, the volume of insurance transactions in developing countries is still rather small. Although the United Nations, particularly UNCTAD, has for some years examined in detail the questions relating to earnings from the invisibles which have a potential to contribute in no small measure to an improvement in the balance of payments and to the economic growth of developing countries, the results of such examination so far have not been encouraging enough.
92.	The reasons for this are not difficult to find. The developed nations are still not willing enough to help and cooperate with the developing countries. They have not yet tried to any reasonable extent to meet the basic requirements of the developing countries. Such cooperation on the basis of equal partnership should take the desirable form of 'give and take', fully understood and implemented by the industrially advanced countries. Here it should be emphasized that similar chronic shipping problems are being faced by many developing countries, like Thailand and some other countries in Asia, which are not yet in a position fully to develop their own national merchant fleets. They are always left at the mercy of foreign flags for sea carriage of cargo, with the result that their export trade is almost totally dependent on foreign lines. Most developing countries are also in a position of weakness in negotiating with shipping conferences either for admission into such bodies or for a reduction in the freight rates unilaterally announced and enforced by the conferences.
93.	All Governments of developing countries attach great importance to shipping. It not only represents an important item of invisible export but is also an effective instrument for export promotion. It is regrettable to note that the system of maritime conferences has not yet taken into account the need of the developing countries. It is not uncommon to find that the freight rates are exorbitant and discriminatory and, in certain cases, represent more than 50 per cent of the costs of certain export products. The rates are found to be prohibitive for many products which need to be exported by developing countries. It is now high time the regime of shipping conferences introduced a new pattern and approach. Those who run the conference system must reduce or even give up the monopolistic structure and practices and thus engage in a greater
new pattern requires equality and mutual consultation, and there must be no unilateral decisions or inferior treatment, which have been the past, practices of the conference system. It is our fervent hope that the United Nations will be able to take still more effective measures without delay to deal with these problems so that discriminatory practices in shipping will no longer be tolerated.
94.	Attention should also be drawn to some other international trade problems facing poorer countries. What is really to be desired in this regard is that th* developed countries should not always take the ac /an tage of imposing damaging quotas or other discriminatory restrictions on the importation of products from developing countries. In other words, what is needed is a freer flow of trade without discrimination or barrier against the products of developing countries. In this connexion, I take this opportunity to commend Australia for being the first country to initiate what are called the tariff preferences for less developed countries, which became effective in April 1966. This, in our view, was a step taken in the right direction.
95.	There can be no doubt that aid is still of great importance and necessary for the development of poorer countries, but these countries must be offered fair and equal opportunities in all fields of aid and trade. Any form of cooperation between the developed and the developing countries should bring about benefits for both sides. The developed countries should adopt measures to discourage the uneconomic production and sale of commodities which compete with those originating from developing countries and should abolish government subsidies which introduce elements of unfair competition into normal commercial transactions, thus causing serious harm to the interests of such nations. As for the disposal of production surpluses or strategic reserves, the utmost care must be taken not to bring about a depression of international prices or adversely to affect the exports of developing countries. There can be no doubt that mutual cooperation in equal partnership, together with a genuine display of political will coupled with a willingness to recognize mutual problems and needs, can open the door to world peace and prosperity.
96.	It is somewhat encouraging to note that the lessons drawn from the shortcomings of the first United Nations Development Decade are now being translated into a global strategy of development. This collective action which the whole community of nations is taking to meet the challenge of underdevelopment will determine the kind of world to which the United Nations is dedicated. In other words, it will decide whether mankind, despite the grim realities before it, will be able ultimately to bring prosperity, stability and lasting peace to the world. It is our firm belief that the international development strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade must have its roots in a firm political commitment based on a will to cooperate. It should also be looked upon as a definite program of action and therefore requires a timetable of activities. Without such a timetable the strategy document would lose much of its meaning. It is also incumbent upon Governments to take the action required in order to attain the goals and objectives of the Decade, thus ensuring a better and happier world for mankind. Let us all hope that the Second United Nations Development Decade which is going to be launched in a few weeks will become a decade of achievement rather than one of empty rhetoric.
97. In connexion with the economic activities of the United Nations, I should like briefly to mention that since 1954 the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has been located in Bangkok in a building provided free of rent by the Government of Thailand to the United Nations. Up to now Bangkok has only had the status of a working site. But in April of this year, ECAFE adopted a resolution declaring Bangkok its permanent site. Then in July, the Economic and Social Council at its forty-ninth session adopted another resolution [1522 (XLIX)] approving ECAFE's recommendation to that effect.
98.	Thailand has always extended its willing assistance and cooperation to the United Nations in providing suitable accommodation for offices. Whenever additional facilities were needed the Government responded positively to the request for further assistance. In 1964, additional facilities were made available to meet the growing requirements of ECAFE. And now, in order to meet the present and anticipated needs of the United Nations, the Government of Thailand has decided to make more land available for new United Nations construction. In this connexion, my Government is also prepared to render further assistance in the preparation and conduct of an architectural and engineering survey.
99.	After twenty-five years of existence attempts should be initiated and vigorously pursued to streamline the procedural arrangements within the United Nations, or else the image of the Organization as the world's ineffective debating society or, worse, as a mere propaganda forum, will continue to linger to the detriment of the entire membership. Such reforms and other corrective measures would help restore the confidence of some sectors of the international community in the efficaciousness of the United Nations and would contribute to making the world body into an effective instrument for dealing with the problems of the 1970s. The United Nations must not be allowed to become a static or a stagnant body oblivious to changing circumstances and other developments since its inception. The twenty-fifth anniversary seems in our view to be the proper occasion to rededicate ourselves to the principles and purposes of the Charter and also to exploring the possibilities of updating its machinery and adapting other institutional practices to the dynamic age and future challenges of the next quarter century.


"
25,1970,SGP," Mr. President, instead of offering you my congratulations as preceding speakers have done, I wish to thank you on behalf of my delegation. We thank you for having sought and accepted election to the Presidency of this historic session of the General Assembly. You bring to that high office a rare combination of experience and qualifications. Not only are you a distinguished diplomat of your country, but you have also been a distinguished international civil servant. You are an eminent scholar, but you have also been a practitioner of the craft of government in your country. With that background, Mr. President, my delegation is confident that your management of our affairs will be principled but practical, expeditious hit not expedient.
23.	This year we celebrate the twenty--fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. But, even as we celebrate the occasion we owe it to the future also to make a realistic appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the Organization. There prevails a substantial body of opinion which maintains that the performance of the United Nations has fallen far short of the expectations. Some have described the Organization as facing a crisis of confidence. Others have said that the United Nations is afflicted with a creeping irrelevance. One thoughtful critic has recently written that 'the United Nations today probably enjoys less confidence on the part of its Members and the public at large than at any previous time in its history'.
24.	What are the causes of this extensive discontent with the United Nations?
25.	The first cause lies in the fact that the United Nations has largely failed to fulfill its primary purpose: to maintain international peace and security. In the period since the Second World War the world has fortunately been spared another global conflict. But the world has not been a peaceful place. In the two and a half decades that have passed, there} have been more than fifty-six conflicts in or between nations which have involved the use or threat of violence. Nineteen of those conflicts were of an interState character; fifteen were internal conflicts with significant external involvement; ten were primarily internal; and twelve others were conflicts of a colonial nature. In only six of those conflicts can it be said that the United Nations played a crucial role in snuffing out the flames of war and restoring a semblance of peace.
26.	Second, although the Charter charges the United Nations to promote and encourage respect for human rights and freedoms for all without distinction as to race, language, sex or religion, the truth is that the United Nations is powerless to intercede on behalf of individuals whose rights have been cruelly infringed by the arbitrary actions of their government or who are the victims of racial, sexual, linguistic or religious discrimination. During the past twenty-five years the United Nations has enacted an impressive body of United Nations law on human rights. Little of this vast body of law is, however, implemented in the Member States.
27.	Third, the discourse in the United Nations has impressed observers, both within and outside the Organization, as consisting mainly of propaganda and inflated rhetoric.
28.	Fourth, the decisions of the United Nation's main deliberative organs have not always conformed to principle or been controlled by proven facts. This state of affairs is the result of the fact that most delegations approach the question of what position they will adopt on a proposal or dispute by considering not where the truth of the matter lies but where their own short-term self-interests lie or, equally reprehensible, by a process of vote trading and bloc voting. Things have reached such a low point that no nation can look safely to the United Nations to assure its security from external aggression. If such a country were the victim of naked and incontrovertible aggression by a stronger and bigger nation and the victim took its complaint to the Security Council, the odds are that the Council would not intercede to repel the aggressor. The operative norm which seems to be observed in the conduct of nations in the United Nations is the following. In a dispute between two States with which one is friendly, try not to get involved. If that is unavoidable, support the stronger against the weaker, for while it may be true that the meek shall inherit the earth, that is only a contingent interest, and the strong, who possess the earth, show no sign of immediate mortality.
29.	Fifth, the reality mirrored in the United Nations is often at odds with objective reality or with the reality in the world. This derives from the fact that many nations play a game of masquerade in the United Nations. Thus, regimes which are feudal and/or repressive at home have been known to send to the United Nations representatives who pose as champions of human rights and liberalism. The discrepancy between the reality at home and the policies pursued and postures assumed in the United Nations cannot but reduce the credibility of this Organization as well as diminish its utility to the Member States as a center to monitor political trends and events around the world.
30.	Sixth, although the Charter speaks of the United Nations as a 'center for harmonizing the actions of nations', Member States have not been conspicuous in seeking to use the Organization for that end. On the contrary, there has been a tendency in the United Nations to exaggerate differences, for competing interest groups to confront each other with a show of passion and drama, sometimes over inconsequential matters or over a mere linguistic difference. In the period of the 1950s and 1960s the ideological East and West were ever ready to take up against each other. As the cold war, as we knew it, has abated and continues to abate, there is another specter looming on the horizon: the specter of an increasingly frequent and bitter confrontation between North, or the rich countries, and South, symbolizing the poor countries. The EastWest confrontation has been productive of nothing except misunderstanding, rancor and acrimony. A NorthSouth confrontation would very likely prove equally sterile. It is therefore to be hoped that the representatives of the rich and the poor nations will turn away from such an unproductive course. The undiplomatic diplomats in the United Nations must be reminded that their primary purpose is to seek accord, not discord. And accord is not beyond attainment if each side shows a willingness to compromise. The rich should give more and meaningful help and the poor, for their part, must demand less of others and more of themselves. External help must be underwritten by the maximum possible self-help.
31.	Seventh, the output or achievement of the United Nations has not been commensurate with the input. The input consists of the numberless hours spent by representatives at meetings and conferences and by experts and other officials of the Secretariat in preparing reports for those meetings, and the resources of the 100 bodies and more commissions, sub commissions. committees, and agencies which make up the United Nations family system.
32.	Why has so much apparent effort produced so little result? Perhaps one reason is the overlapping memberships of those bodies. Human ingenuity being limited, the same speeches are made over and over again by the same speakers in those different bodies. One would also be justified in suspecting that the great proliferation of United Nations bodies has not tended towards greater efficiency; on the contrary, it may have detracted therefrom. It is clear that the United Nations itself is in need of a family planning program.
33.	I am conscious of the fact that I have spoken critically of the United Nations. In doing so, it has not been my intention to cause the Organization harm but, on the contrary, it has been my intention to diagnose the ills of the Organization so that we can, together, find remedies for its maladies. One noted scholar has said that institutions languish when their lovers are uncritical and their critics unloving. I identify myself as one of the critical lovers and loving critics of the United Nations. In that spirit, let me turn to ask how we can resuscitate the United Nations.
34.	Two aspects of the United Nations need resuscitation: the first constitutional, the second cerebral. The first is concerned with improving the organization, procedures, rules, customs and practices of the United Nations. In pursuance of that objective, my delegation has joined that of Canada and several other delegations in proposing a new agenda item entitled 'Rationalization of the procedures and organization of the General Assembly'. We propose that a committee be created to examine the system of committees, the allocation of agenda items, the organization of the work of the Assembly, documentation and rules of procedure and to submit recommendations thereon to the next session of the Assembly,
35.	It is not my intention here to preempt the work of the proposed committee, but I should like to touch briefly on a few salient points. It is clear that if the General Assembly is to carry out its work efficiently it must be guided by a steering committee. The intention of the Charter is for the General Committee to be the steering committee of the Assembly. The General Committees of past Assembly sessions have, however, not made effective use of their powers. They have been too intimidated by the dead hand of precedent. It must be clearly understood that there is nothing sacrosanct about the existing structure of committees or about previous decisions concerning the allocation of agenda items to the different committees. Whether an agenda item should be made a subitem of another item or stand as a single item and whether several agenda items pertaining to the same subject matter should be discussed together or separately are questions which should be discussed dispassionately and rationally by the General Committee and not be subject to obfuscating procedural politics. That Committee should also ensure an equitable distribution of workload among the committees as well as prevent the duplication of work between committees.
36.	While it may be impractical, and perhaps even undesirable, to impose time-limits on speeches in the General Assembly, it may be beneficial to consider whether the imposition of time-limits on statements in the committees would be helpful. This is particularly desirable, in my delegation's view, in the case of second and subsequent statements by the same speakers on the same item as well as for rights of reply.
37.	To facilitate the work of the committees, it would be helpful if the Chairmen of the committees were to establish at the commencement of each session, in each committee, one or more working groups for the purpose of reconciling conflicting draft resolutions.
38.	With respect to the Security Council, my delegation welcomes the recent decision of the Council to meet periodically in closed session at the minimum level of Foreign Ministers. We feel that the Security Council should make greater use of individuals and small committees to meet with parties to disputes in order to explore the possibilities of settlement. We would also support a proposal that the Security Council create a United Nations panel for fact-finding and mediation. We support such a proposal because Member States that are unwilling to accept the judgments of third parties might be willing to accept the process of factfinding and mediation while reserving the right to challenge the conclusions of those third parties. Such a panel should consist of men chosen by the SecretaryGeneral on the basis of their skill and expertise in the settlement of international or domestic disputes.
39.	The foregoing suggestions are designed to improve the machinery of the United Nations. Improving the machinery of the United Nations is, however, only one half of the cure. The other half, which is both more crucial and less easy to accomplish, is to persuade Member States to change the policies that they pursue towards the United Nations and towards one another in the United Nations. Unless Member States are prepared to do so all the procedural and institutional reforms will be of little or no avail.
40.	First, Member States should attempt to understand better the nature of the General Assembly's decision-making process. It is essential to do so because otherwise we shall not know when we may properly refer questions to the General Assembly and when we should refrain from doing so. Scholars have postulated that decision-making processes are analytically of three types: those which are legislative, those which are adjudicative and those which are managerial. A legislative type decision-making process is one which enunciates a rule, principle or norm of general application. An adjudicative type decision is one which settles a dispute between two or more parties in accordance with a preexisting rule, principle or norm. A decision concerning how certain given resources ought to be allocated is characterized as managerial. The decision-making process of the General Assembly appears to us to approximate most to the legislative model. If we are correct in giving it that characterization, then I: follows that delegations should refrain from referring questions to the General Assembly which are not amenable to a legislative type decision. A border dispute between two States, for example, raises issues which are not amenable to a legislative decision and should, therefore, not be referred to the General Assembly. Failure to heed this is likely to bring about the same result as using a machine for a purpose for which it is not designed. Not only would the job be left undone but we also run the risk of wrecking the machine.
41.	Second, the demands which Member States make in the United Nations ought to be governed by a more realistic estimation of what is attainable. Too often delegations forget this and succeed only in disillusioning themselves when a hard-won victory is later found to be impossible to implement.
42.	Third and finally, Member States must be made to recognize that the one factor which has most undermined the strength and efficacy of the United Nations is the fact that most delegations have pursued, in the United Nations, policies which are predominantly governed by their short-term national interests. Unless nations can be persuaded to conceive of their self interests as having a longterm perspective in addition to the short-term one, and unless self-interests are married to principle, then the prospect is that the next twenty-five years will be much like the past twenty-five years.




"
25,1970,USA,"1.	 It is my privilege to extend to you once again the warm congratulations of the United States delegation on your election to the Presidency of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your country has few peers in the contributions it has made to the work of this Organization. Your father was a leader in the League of Nations, and now, in this session of the General Assembly, you are adding a new chapter in the family tradition. In the United Nations community we have long known you as an able spokesman of your country, as a participant in the life of the United Nations from its very beginning and an authority on the Charter, as a leading scholar and practitioner in international law, and as one whose personal outlook is strongly humanitarian and imbued with hope and determination for a better future. We are indeed fortunate to have you to lead us in this session devoted to the strengthening and improvement of the United Nations.
2.	During this session we shall commemorate with fitting ceremony one of the most creative and hopeful events of this century, the founding of the United Nations twenty-five years ago. It is right that this commemoration should be held. It is far more important, however, that the nations gathered at this session should so act together as to strengthen the United Nations for the future, to ensure that we are closer to 'peace, justice and progress' five, ten and twenty- five years hence than we are today. The world is unlikely to care much what we say about the past. It will care a great deal what we do about the future.
3.	The problems the world faces today are no less grave than those it faced twenty-five years ago. Indeed they are in many respects far graver. Unless and until the Members of the United Nations demonstrate their willingness to deal effectively with these problems, the confidence of the world's peoples in the United Nations will remain uncertain and precarious.
4.	In the view of the United States, the most critical international problem today is the same as that which faced the founders of the United Nations: the need to build a reliable framework for peace and security among nations. As President Nixon said in this Assembly a year ago: '... there is no nobler destiny, nor any greater gift that one age could make to the ages that follow, than to forge the key to a lasting peace'. [1755th meeting, para. 45.]
5.	In this conviction the United States has sought in the last two years to frame foreign policies which would help to make the international scene less destructively competitive, less strident, more cooperative and orderly. We have sought, in the spirit of the Charter, to pursue peaceful settlement of all conflicts and confrontations, and we have urged others to do likewise.
6.	The most significant of these efforts has been the strategic arms limitation discussions between my country and the Soviet Union. If at last we can check the nuclear arms race, the world will have been helped to move away from its gravest danger and toward new and more rational relationships.
7.	The United States also seeks, through a process of serious negotiation, to ease the tensions that arise from the division of Europe. We have welcomed the efforts of the Federal Republic of Germany to normalize relations with its eastern neighbors; we are seeking in fourPower talks to assure the security and wellbeing of the residents of Berlin; we have joined our NATO allies in proposing exploratory talks on the reduction of forces in central Europe. We hope these efforts will find the Soviet Union and its allies forthcoming.
8.	In VietNam, over eighteen months ago, the United States reversed the trend in American involvement in the war. We began a steady, uninterrupted reduction in the number of our troops. We have made a negotiated peace our highest priority. Although North VietNam has as yet shown no serious intention to negotiate a solution under which the South VietNamese people can freely decide their own future, this remains our goal and we shall not be discouraged in seeking it.
A/PV.1854
9.	My Government has likewise sought ways to move toward a constructive relationship with mainland China. To this end, we have taken a number of unilateral steps to ease tensions. We are ready at any time to resume the talks in Warsaw.
10.	Finally, nowhere in the world today is there more urgent need to move from confrontation to negotiation than in the Middle East. The legacy of bitterness, hatred and suspicion there contains the seeds of even greater tragedy not only for the Middle East but for the world, unless there is early progress toward reconciliation and peace based on the legitimate interests of all the States and peoples of the region.
11.	As the United Nations community well knows, the United States has made major diplomatic efforts in recent months and weeks to help bring about peace at long last in the Middle East. While recent developments in the area, including the tragic death of President Nasser, have cast a shadow over the high hopes of just a few weeks ago that a beginning toward that goal had been made, those hopes have not been extinguished. For the most part, the guns remain silent along the ceasefire lines. Security Council resolution 242 (1967) stands as a beacon pointing the way to peace, and the parties concerned, in accepting the United States initiative of June, have committed themselves to carry out that resolution in all its parts. Ambassador Jarring is ready to resume his mission whenever conditions permit. We earnestly hope that the parties themselves and all others concerned will now bend every effort to the task of building on the beginning that has already been made.
12.	This will require above all serious steps to restore and strengthen confidence in the integrity of the ceasefire and military standstill agreement along the Suez Canal. It will also require, if negotiations are to move forward, a willingness by the parties to move from their maximum positions on the elements of a realistic and equitable peace settlement. In this spirit, my Government is prepared to contribute to renewed efforts toward peace in the Middle East.
13.	In this anniversary year the United States, like many other Members, has given especially careful thought to means by which the United Nations can be better enabled to fulfill its purposes.
14.	My delegation has listened, and will continue to listen attentively, to the suggestions of others in this regard. In the same spirit the United States will offer proposals, or support the proposals of others, with these objectives among others: first, to put United Nations peacekeeping operations on a firmer and more reliable basis; second, to make the United Nations more effective in the peaceful settlement of disputes; third, to promote new steps in the field of disarmament; fourth, to move closer by peaceful means to the goals of decolonization and human equality; fifth, to support the Second Development Decade; sixth, to help slow down too rapid rates of population growth; seventh, to promote the exploitation of the seabeds and outer space for human benefit; eighth, to organize common action within the United Nations to safeguard the global environment; ninth, to encourage young people from all parts of the world to devote themselves to international service; tenth, to improve the organization, administration and procedures of the United Nations.
15.	If the twenty-fifth General Assembly were to move forward substantially in these directions, this session would indeed rank as one of the most fruitful in United Nations history.
16.	Let me now comment briefly on these points.
17.	We shall all of us on this podium and in the First Committee have much to say during this session about strengthening international peace and security, and about the need to live up to the Charter. This is quite proper. However, what is needed most in this respect is not still more sweeping declarations that merely restate the purposes and principles of the Charter. What is needed is more effective United Nations action on the concrete issues before us, on the Middle East, on United Nations peacekeeping procedures, on means of pacific settlement. Until we demonstrate our willingness to take such effective action, world opinion will continue to be skeptical, no matter what ringing declarations we may make, as to whether the Members of the United Nations are really serious about strengthening international peace and security.
18.	I now come to a subject which should be at the very center of our concern if we wish in fact to strengthen peace and security through the United Nations. I speak of United Nations peacekeeping.
19.	Because the world situation in the past twenty- five years developed differently from what the founders of the United Nations foresaw, it has not been found possible to create forces for the maintenance of international peace and security along the lines laid down in certain articles of Chapter VII. We would hope that at some point the provisions of the Charter designed for enforcement action can be implemented.
20.	In the meantime, however, a modus vivendi has been built up, entirely consistent with the Charter, which has carried out significant and successful peacekeeping operations, sometimes with observers, sometimes with substantial forces, in the Middle East, in Kashmir, in the Congo, in Cyprus and elsewhere. Still it is all too clear that these ad hoc and improvised arrangements need major improvement in several respects if future peacekeeping is to be effective.
21.	The Assembly's Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, under the able and patient leadership of Ambassador Cuevas Cancino of Mexico, has been laboring for nearly two years at the task of developing peacekeeping guidelines. During the past year the United States has put forward concrete proposals for new procedures that would meet the political concerns of all and yet allow United Nations forces to move rapidly to carry out decisions of the Security Council. But the broad agreement that all desire is still lacking.
22.	It is high time however that the General Assembly, in this twenty-fifth anniversary year, demanded significant movement on this problem. It would be a mistake not to move at all until all are agreed to move all the way. There is strong reason and sufficient consensus for some forward movement at this Assembly. The United States will be prepared to join with others in concrete proposals to this effect.
23.	In this connexion we welcome the statement made at Lusaka in the Declaration of the nonaligned countries concerning the United Nations, that measures should be taken at this session of the General Assembly to strengthen United Nations peacekeeping, and we look forward with interest to proposals that may be made by those present at that meeting.
24.	Of course, peacekeeping without peaceful settlement is only an expedient, necessary but incomplete and inconclusive. The most potent preventive of conflict is not machinery but the will of disputing parties to show restraint and a spirit of conciliation, and to persist in peaceful methods until settlement is reached. This is a solemn obligation of every United Nations Member under the Charter, and no nation deserves more honor than those who have lived up to it in spite of every obstacle.
25.	In this past year such peaceful settlements, or major steps towards them, have been recorded in a number of situations which reflect great credit on the statesmanship of those involved. I have in mind, for example, the progress made, with the assistance of the Organization of American States, toward resolving the dispute between El Salvador and Honduras; and also the recent peaceful decision on the future of Bahrain, in which good offices provided by the Secretary General played a major role.
26.	As these cases show, where the will to settle exists, effective machinery can do much to help. This is true of regional organizations, and it is no less true of the relevant organs of the United Nations, above all the Security Council.
27.	In this connexion we have welcomed the Security Council's decision [see 1544th meeting] as proposed by Finland, to hold periodic high-level meetings under Article 28 of the Charter. My country looks forward to taking part in the first such meeting later this fall. We welcome likewise the valuable suggestion of Brazil committees of the Council, including the parties to a dispute, might be created to help settle particular disputes.
28.	To the same end, the United States would favor the reactivation of certain machinery for peaceful settlement which has long been dormant. Many years ago the General Assembly created a Panel on Inquiry and Conciliation [resolution 268 (III)], and more recently a register of fact-finding experts. My Government will soon nominate qualified individuals for both of these bodies. We believe fact-finders should be available to
1 Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non Aligned Countries, held at Lusaka, Zambia, from 8 to 10 September 1970.
the SecretaryGeneral or other organs of the United Nations, or directly to Member States, to report on the facts of situations of international concern at the request or with the consent of one or more of the parties.
29.	Finally, it is most important that we rejuvenate and strengthen the highest organ of judicial settlement, the International Court of Justice. The United States recently joined with others in the Security Council in referring to the Court for its advisory opinion certain aspects of the Namibia situation. We have also joined with others in submitting to this General Assembly an agenda item calling for a review of the role of the Court. We hope this review will suggest ways to enable the Court to make a more substantial contribution to the establishment of the rule of law among nations.
30.	The world has witnessed in recent weeks shocking examples of the consequences of failure to abide by this rule of law examples which have been alluded to by numerous previous speakers on this podium. Hundreds of innocent individuals engaged in peaceful international travel have been brutally seized as hostages in a conflict in which they were in no way involved. Not only their safety and convenience have been placed in jeopardy but their very lives. As President Nixon pointed out in this forum a year ago, this issue 'involves the interests of. . . every air passenger and the integrity of that structure of order upon which a world community depends' [1755th meeting, para. 74].
31.	That this view is widely shared is evident from the almost universal condemnation of these most recent acts by Governments the world over and by the resolution on this matter adopted unanimously by the Security Council [286 (1970)]. But condemnation is not enough. It is time to act. The Tokyo Convention, providing for the prompt return of hijacked aircraft passengers and crew, requires the broadest international support. The same is true of the International Civil Aviation Organization's draft multilateral convention for the extradition and punishment of hijackers. In addition, the United States has submitted new proposals to the ICAO, for which I urge your most earnest consideration and support.
32.	The General Assembly's extensive annual debates and resolutions on many aspects of arms control and disarmament have long played, and continue to play, an important part in international negotiations on this most critical of all our problems. I need only mention the partial nuclear test-ban Treaty,  the outer space Treaty [resolution 2222 (XXI)] and the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]. The disarmament conference at Geneva has this year registered significant progress by achieving wide consensus on a draft treaty to prohibit the emplacement of weapons of mass destruction on a vast area of the earth's surface the seabed beneath the oceans.  We hope this draft treaty will be supported by the General Assembly at this session and opened for signature shortly thereafter.
33.	I can assure the Assembly that the United States Government is unceasingly aware of the worldwide concern and need for an end to the arms race and the perilous burden of armaments in all its forms, and that we shall do whatever one negotiating partner can do to bring about new agreements on new steps toward the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament.
34.	Permit me to say a word about a matter of quite different but equally wide concern that of human rights throughout the world.
35.	In addition to the basic responsibility of Governments to maintain human rights for all their citizens, the United Nations under the Charter has a clear responsibility in this regard. To strengthen the implementation of that responsibility my Government hopes the General Assembly at this session will create a new post, that of High Commissioner for Human Rights, to advise United Nations organs in this field and to assist States, at their request, with human rights problems. This proposal has been thoroughly studied and fully justified. It deserves a high priority at the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.
36.	A particular issue of human rights that is of acute concern to my Government, among others, is the protection of the rights of prisoners of war. While these rights have long since been internationally guaranteed, they are in practice still denied to many prisoners of war, as American wives and families of such prisoners know to their great sorrow. The United States strongly hopes that this Assembly will press for worldwide observance of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, verified by impartial inspection. It is intolerable that the tragedy of armed conflict should be compounded by additional inhumanities in violation of international norms.
37.	In no field have the aims of the United Nations found more dramatic fulfilment during its first quarter of a century than in the field of decolonization. Before the Second World War a third of mankind lived in colonial dependencies. Today the proportion is less than 1 per cent. A revolution of independence has created some sixty new nations and has been the main factor in increasing the membership of the United Nations from 51 to 126.
38.	However, the situation in much of southern Africa is still characterized by the denial of self-determination and of racial equality. The United Nations and its member States must continue to exert peaceful efforts to defend and advance these basic human rights of the peoples concerned. Their cause is just and must in time prevail.
39.	Against these evils the United States in recent months has taken further steps. We put into effect last May a new policy designed to discourage United States investment in, and trade with, Namibia so long as South Africa remains in unlawful occupation. We urge other Governments to join us in this policy. My Government continues strictly to observe resolutions in regard to sanctions against the illegal regime in Rhodesia and in regard to the sale of arms to South Africa. We have closed our consulate in Salisbury. We shall continue in every peaceful and practicable way to pursue the ends of justice, equality and self determination.
40.	High on the list of the United Nations contributions to human progress is its longstanding effort to assist in comprehensive global development. That effort is being continued and, we hope, improved and strengthened through the launching of the Second United Nations Development Decade.
41.	The success of the Decade will depend most of all on the policies of Member States, both developed and developing. To bring all these policies into effective focus is the ambitious aim of the development strategy. The United States strongly supports the strategy which is before this Assembly [A 17982, para. 16] and intends to participate fully in this common enterprise.
42.	I wish to leave no doubt of the serious commitment of the United States to the Second Development Decade. President Nixon, in a series of policy decisions and especially in his recent announcement on the new focus of United States economic assistance, has made clear our intention:
(a)	To reverse the downward trend in United States development assistance;
(b)	To increase substantially United States contributions to multilateral development institutions including the World Bank, the International Development Association, the regional development banks and the United Nations Development program so that, as the capabilities of these institutions increase, we may be able to channel through them most of our official development assistance;
(c)	Further to encourage the efforts of donor nations to 'untie' their bilateral aid to developing countries from the obligation to import products of the donor country;
(<d) To bring United States science and technology more effectively to bear on the problems of development, and for this purpose to create a new United States International Development Institute;
(<?) To take new steps to stimulate American private investment in developing countries within the framework of the developing countries' plans.
43.	These approaches are already reflected in the new policies my country has announced toward Latin America and Africa, which stress continued assistance, greater multilateral participation, and increased trade and investment.
44.	Finally, bearing in mind the crucial connexion between trade and development, the United States is pressing for a liberalized system of generalized tariff preferences for products of developing countries, with preferential access to the American market, and we are urging that the developing countries receive similar access to the markets of all developed countries.
45.	I wish to add a particular comment on the role of the United Nations Development program. This program, in cooperation with the specialized agencies, has done important pioneering work in development assistance. Its machinery, however, was built for a smaller program and must be reorganized to meet its growing responsibilities. With the aid of last year's excellent 'capacity study' ,  the program is now preparing to put the necessary reforms into effect. In planning our future contributions to this important program we in the United States will give major weight to the progress actually achieved m undertaking these reforms.
46.	In recent years people all over the world have suddenly awakened to the inexorable and tragic fact that excessive population growth can, if continued much longer, frustrate all our hopes for peace, justice and progress. There can be no progress for the majority of mankind if population growth outstrips all available means of development. There can be no justice for the majority of mankind where population expands faster than production and social services. There can be no peace for the majority of mankind where progress and justice are unattainable because of unrestrained population growth.
47.	This is not a problem confined to either developed or developing countries. In my own country, although our growth rate has recently slowed to about 1 per cent a year, we have adopted as a national goal the availability within five years of family planning services to every citizen.
48.	Clearly, the need is equally urgent in many nations striving for development whose annual population growth in some cases approaches 4 per cent which means a doubling of the number of people in less than twenty- years. The care and feeding of such enormous numbers of dependent children, their upbringing in conditions compatible with human dignity, could constitute such a burden as to nullify progress in economic development and to cause living standards to remain at past low levels or even to fall lower.
49.	The United States is convinced that the vigorous pursuit of family planning policies is an indispensable element in the strategy of development. In this conviction we have pledged this year $7.5 million to the recently established United Nations Fund for Population Activities, whose services to requesting Governments are rapidly growing.
50.	In the context of development I wish also to emphasize the enormous potential of the world's deep seabeds, whose exploitation is just now beginning to come within the reach of our technology.
51.	Last May President Nixon, in a farreaching announcement concerning the oceans, proposed that an international regime be established by treaty for the exploitation of seabed resources beyond the depth of 200 meters. He further proposed that this regime 'should provide for the collection of substantial mineral royalties to be used for international community purposes, particularly economic assistance to developing countries'. Early in August the United States circulated in the United Nations seabed Committee  a draft convention [A18021, annex V], embodying these and other important proposals in the President's announcement.
52.	These proposals, if carried out, will amount to a new departure in the history of nations. Never in history has the exploitation of resources of such great potential value been placed under the supervision and regulation of an effective international authority. Never in history has assurance been offered that the international community could have a substantial, independent source of revenue to be equitably divided to serve the interests of mankind as a whole.
53.	The United States hopes that the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly will advance this important enterprise so that a sound and workable international seabed regime, backed up by effective machinery, can come into being as soon as possible. To this end it is important that States refrain from making further claims to jurisdiction over the seabeds or over the waters of the oceans. We believe that a conference on subjects related to the law of the sea, including seabeds, should be called as soon as practicable and that preparatory steps should be initiated by this session of the General Assembly.
54.	I come now to an issue of critical and rapidly growing importance the protection of the human environment. Development and protection of the environment are not mutually contradictory; indeed, they must go hand in hand if the world is to be a fit place in which to live. The United Nations is in a key position to foster the necessary cooperation so that the needs of the environment, as well as those of development, receive the energetic attention they require.
55.	Already the plans for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in 1972 have begun to take shape and have helped to focus the attention of United Nations Member Governments on this worldwide challenge; but we should not wait for the Stockholm Conference before launching necessary initiatives.
56.	Therefore the United States urges that all of us here, representing both developed and developing countries, work together to enable the United Nations to take the following steps. Firstly, it should identify those environmental problems, especially those pollutants in the atmosphere and the oceans, which are or may be dangerous on a global scale. Second, it should make plans for a coordinated world monitoring network to keep track of these environmental dangers. This network should build on existing programs, particularly those of the agencies of the United Nations family, and should use the most advanced data processing and satellite technology, such as the earth resource survey satellites which my country has been developing. Third, it should collect and analyze the suggestions of governments concerning environmental guidelines for States, both developed and developing, as well as for international institutions engaged in development programs. Fourth, it should explore the possibility of establishing international air and water quality standards. The United States hopes the Assembly at this session will act to advance those important objectives.
51. A newly acute problem which threatens a growing number of societies is the epidemic spread of addiction to dangerous drugs, especially among young people. This phenomenon has mushroomed in a very few years, not only in my own country but in a number of others, both developed and developing. It creates untold misery, violence, lawlessness and economic and human loss.This menace must be stopped. To do so it will be necessary to reinforce existing international agreements and to strengthen the longstanding and excellent work of agencies in this field, especially those of the United Nations. We are glad to note that the Commission on Narcotic Drugs is meeting now to deal with the whole range of problems involved, from the poppy field through the international syndicate to the needle in the vein. My Government hopes that an adequate action program will emerge from this process and will command the energetic support of the community of nations. The United States has already offered, subject to Congressional approval, a contribution of $2 million to such a program.
58.	Finally, it is important that we make better use of the talents of young people in international service, especially the service of the United Nations. Many delegations to this session, including that of the United States, contain youthful members as suggested by the General Assembly a year ago. That is entirely fitting, because the fate of the United Nations and indeed of world peace will soon be in their hands.
59.	With that in mind President Nixon, in his address to this Assembly a year ago [1755th meeting], pledged the enthusiastic support of the United States for Iran's proposal to establish an international volunteer service corps [see 1695th meeting, para. 75], to work in the cause of development and to be recruited on an individual basis from the people, principally young people, of many countries. We hope that proposal will be given final approval in the current session. We hope also that the United Nations will seek new ways to encourage able young people to find careers in its Secretariat and those of the other agencies of the United Nations family.
60.	In these remarks I have discussed only a few of the major tasks facing the United Nations in the years ahead. Even those, however, are enough tc make it obvious that, if we indeed address ourselves to such tasks, the effectiveness of this Organization will be tested more severely than ever. To meet this test we shall have to be far more attentive than has been our habit to many matters of structure, organization and procedure. For example, I would mention the following.
61.	In considering applications for membership by very small States, we must make sure that they are not only willing but also, as the Charter stipulates, able to carry out the Charter's obligations. As the SecretaryGeneral has for years pointed out, many Territories now moving towards independence are too small, either in population or in resources or both, to carry out the minimum obligations which membership requires. Yet these very small entities need more than most the assistance that the United Nations system can provide. Where the burden of membership would be excessive, we should provide a form of association with the United Nations which would enable such States to enjoy the benefits without the burdens of the system.
62.	The persistence of the United Nations financial deficit undermines confidence in the Organization, threatens its capabilities in many fields and casts a cloud over its future. The United States welcomes the SecretaryGeneral's recent call for 'a concerted effort to restore the financial solvency of the Organization'. We hope that he will himself take a lead in such an effort, in which we shall certainly play our part.
63.	In the annual choice of non-permanent members of the Security Council, it would be well that, as the Charter requires, due regard be specially paid, in the first instance, to the prospective member's contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security, rather than merely to rotation among the members of geographic groups.
64.	The primary consideration in selecting individuals for posts in the Secretariat, above all for senior posts, should be fully to meet the Charter's 'paramount consideration' namely 'the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity'.
65.	We must at long last take decisive steps to streamline the excessively time-consuming organization and procedures of the General Assembly, as Canada has wisely proposed, or else we shall either 'drown in a sea of words' or suffocate under an avalanche of paper.
66.	We must take more effective measures to ensure that the entire United Nations system is so organized and managed that it responds efficiently to the directives of its governing organs and to the priority needs of the world. That will require much better administrative and budgetary coordination and control than we have yet achieved.
67.	The United States offers these suggestions in the spirit of the twenty-fifth anniversary session, which we understand to be a spirit of sober determination to make this Organization more effective, to make its future more responsive than its past to the imperative needs of men, women and children everywhere. Many other delegations have offered or will offer their proposals in the same spirit. The test of our seriousness and our success will be how much of this agenda of objectives we can begin to carry out.
68.	We are assembled from the four corners of the earth. The interests of the Governments we speak for often seem to be and sometimes are in contradiction. But by our presence here, by our commitment to the United Nations and its Charter, we have acknowledged that we also have interests in common, interests in peace, justice and progress, interests in the continued habitability of our planet, common interests which we are at last beginning to recognize are inescapable and overriding.
69.	The question now is, do we have the wit not only to perceive these common interests in some vague rhetorical way, but also to act upon them together realistically and decisively even at the cost sometimes of older and narrower interests? If we do not do so, history may sweep aside not only this Organization but also the nations that compose it.
70.	The SecretaryGeneral has said that we may have only ten years left to cope effectively with the problems of our times before they become so staggering as to be beyond our capacities. As we enter the Disarmament Decade and the Second Development Decade, let us keep that warning foremost in our minds and let us be determined to act together to avert catastrophe.




"
25,1970,PAK,"
60.	  Recognizing Ambassador Hambro's long and very close association with the United Nations, in the tradition of service to the international community set by his distinguished father, and his own unrivaled qualifications, this Assembly has, indeed, done itself good service by electing him to his present high office. While offering our felicitations to him on this occasion, I must say that it is a matter of real satisfaction to my country's delegation that, in this crucial year of the history of the United Nations, the choice should have fallen on a person of his eminence and caliber for the conduct of the affairs of the General Assembly.
61.	I should not fail here to pay a tribute to his illustrious predecessor, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph of Liberia, who has become such a source of pride for the people of Africa and for womanhood in general.
62.	The United Nations having come of age by now, it is only natural that people of understanding all over the world should give serious thought to the effectiveness of this large and growing but not yet complete family of nations, and that the participants in this Assembly on the historic occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization should, in particular, pause for a while to evaluate its achievements and to take stock of its shortcomings. While a measure of self-congratulation on its achievements would be permissible and in all fairness this should not be grudged it would not be an idle exercise to reflect on the reasons why the United Nations has fallen short of the expectations entertained about it when its Charter was first conceived.
63.	The theme of this twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations is 'Peace, justice and progress'. No words could better sum up the purposes for which the Organization was founded than those three words, chosen by the General Assembly in 'the desire that 1970 will mark the beginning of an era of peace'.
64.	In the 25 years that have gone by, mankind has been spared the catastrophe of a nuclear war though at times the world has teetered on the brink of such a war or a global conflict. But they have been marked by EastWest tensions and confrontations. Wars and conflicts have ravaged Asia and Africa and have taken their toll of human life. Suffering and destruction have been inflicted on millions of people in the two continents. Many disputes and situations that threaten peace remain unresolved and unadjusted; insecurity haunts nations large and small; the use, or threat, of force in international relations remains ever present; the race in armaments threatens to become uncontrollable; what has aptly been called the 'sophisticated insanity ' of superPower competition in the development and deployment of strategic offensive and defensive weapons systems poses a threat to the very survival of the human race.
65.	Today, as in the past, anxious thought is being given by Members to the state of the United Nations, to finding out why its affairs are so much out of joint and how to remedy its ills. The weaknesses of the United Nations are ascribed sometimes to its machinery the organization, procedures and methods of its main organs and sometimes to the tendency of Member States to bring to the United Nations matters which, from a realistic point of view, it cannot resolve.
66.	The machinery of the United Nations is undoubtedly susceptible to improvement. Pakistan supports Canada's timely and well-considered initiative for rationalizing the procedures and organization of the General Assembly.
67.	The Security Council has taken an important step towards its greater effectiveness by adopting, a few months ago [see 1544th meetingJ, Finland's proposal for holding periodic meetings, at the level of Ministers, for a general exchange of views on the international situation.
68.	Pakistan believes that the Security Council could also, with advantage, consider other steps, such as: meeting from time to time to review the status of implementation of its own resolutions; reviving the practice of establishing subsidiary organs under Article 29 of the Charter for the purpose of investigation or fact-finding in the case of situations which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute; establishing subsidiary organs for the purposes of inquiry, good offices, conciliation and mediation in the case of disputes, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security. Should such methods and procedures not bring about the easing of a dispute and the parties do not agree on a method of pacific settlement, the Security Council itself should embark on conciliation or mediation, and, if these fail to bring about a solution, call upon the parties to submit their disputes to arbitration or judicial settlement.
69.	The decline of the Economic and Social Council is manifest in the diffusion of its fundamental policymaking role, in its inability to rationalize its coordinating functions and in its ineffectiveness to ensure the provision of adequate resources for the approved programs. This Council needs to be so organized as to meet the challenge of international development. Its prime function should be to draw up, with the assistance of the United Nations family of organizations, and supervise the execution of, a strategy of growth and development designed to assist in the achievement of development goals. A more effective coordination of the activities of the United Nations system should be another of its principal tasks.
70.	Thus, serious and continuing consideration is being given to improving the working of the principal organs of the United Nations. However, it cannot be gainsaid that causes more fundamental than mere defects in organization and methods are responsible for the failure of the United Nations to perform its foremost political tasks: namely, the prevention of the use, or threat, of force in international relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes.
71.	How many nations, more particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, are willing to subordinate what they conceive to be their national interests to the purposes and principles of the United Nations? To what extent are they prepared to give effect to the decisions of the Security Council and to act in accordance with the resolutions of the other principal organs? Does the exclusion from the Organization of the People's Republic of China, comprising a quarter of mankind, enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations in serving the cause of peace and justice? Can progress be made towards realizing the Charter goal of promoting 'better standards of life in larger freedom' when resources placed at its disposal are inadequate for promoting the economic and social development of the third world?
72.	The answers to these questions have little to do with the machinery of the United Nations. They turn on the will of Member States to provide the machinery with the motive power. Such will needs to be sustained and continuous. Until now, it has been only sporadic.
73.	The second charge against the United Nations is that many Member States betray a lack of realism by bringing to the Organization matters on which it is not able to take meaningful action. But if Member States the overwhelming majority of them insecure and aggrieved approach this Organization for protection or redress when threatened or denied their lawful rights, are they being unrealistic? If so, does it now follow that the purposes of the United Nations peace and justice and progress are, realistically speaking, unattainable?
74.	If we accept such a proposition, we may as well abandon hope for the future of mankind. We may as well succumb to counsels of despair. But the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Alec DouglasHome, in his address on 24 September, said:
'If there does begin to emerge at last, out of all the negotiations now in progress, a common interest in peace and stability, it will transform our work., both in the Security Council and in the Assembly of this Organization...'/7848th meeting, para. 126],
75.	Two of these negotiations strike us as specially significant: the strategic arms limitation talks in Helsinki and Vienna, and those relating to the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union. They seem to us to bear the promise of detente and strengthening of international security that may well be of historic significance. At the same time, it is our profound conviction that an accommodation between the People's Republic of China and the other major Powers is indispensable for forging a common interest in world peace based on justice. It is only when such a consummation is achieved that the possibilities inherent in the United Nations of inaugurating the decade of the seventies as an era of peace, justice and progress can be realized.
76.	The necessity of restoring the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is now increasingly recognized. As Foreign Minister Schumann of France said here on 18 September, it is 'an illusion...to believe that the Organization can perform its task while remaining incomplete'. Unfortunately, some of the suggestions heard in this regard are bound to create another major problem rather than resolve the existing one.
77.	The 'twoChinas'or a 'China and Formosa' proposal is untenable on any political or legal grounds. Politically, it would create new tensions by perpetuating the deepest grievance of the People's Republic of China. It would set a dangerous precedent for undermining the territorial integrity of validly constituted States. In regard to its legal aspects, both the Cairo Declaration of 1943 and the Potsdam Declaration of 1945 pledged restoration of Formosa to China. The only solution, therefore, is to seat the representative of the People's Republic of China in all the organs of the United Nations and to exclude those who now occupy China's seat.
78.	This historic occasion is a challenge to Member States to renew efforts to strengthen international security by bringing about just and lasting solutions to those situations where armed conflicts are taking place or dangerous tensions still exist. An end to the hostilities in IndoChina, to the torment of the Middle East, to the agony of Kashmir, and to the festering disputes in other parts of the world which might erupt into armed conflict, must be brought about without delay on the basis of the principles of the Charter, international agreements or resolutions of the United Nations. Foreign troops must be removed from territories occupied through force or on false legal grounds. Independence must be granted to peoples still suffering under the colonial yoke. The right of self determination of a people, recognized by the United Nations to be entitled to it, must be upheld. Movements of national liberation must be conceded their due rights.
79.	These objectives can be realized only if the United Nations is enabled to discharge its conciliatory, preventive, corrective and, where necessary, punitive functions in conformity with the Charter without being paralyzed by power politics. This demands a change of attitude towards the United Nations on the part of Member States, especially the permanent members of the Security Council, It is only such a change that will bring about the implementation of the Security Council resolutions and the fulfillment of international agreements reached under its auspices.
80.	It is our firm conviction that in situations of conflict, lasting solutions cannot be found unless justice is rendered to the aggrieved.,The best service to the cause of the United Nations would be to recognize the distinction between the concept of security through peace with justice and the notion of security through peace without justice, and to base our policies on that recognition.
81.	The inextricable relationship in fact, the interdependence between the state of international security and disarmament is so generally recognized to be axiomatic that it is not necessary to labor this point. Tensions fuel the arms race and the arms race feeds tensions. For almost a quarter of a century the United Nations has concerned itself with disarmament as one of the main subjects on its agenda. While the outcome has certainly not been negligible, neither has it been impressive. While a series of non-armament measures have been agreed upon, disarmament as such has defied all our untiring efforts.
| 82. Among measures of non-armament, the entry into force of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons last March is a matter for general satisfaction. Pakistan voted in favor of the General Assembly resolution commending the Treaty [2373 (XXII)], as we fully subscribe to its objectives. But it remains our view that the effectiveness of the Treaty will depend on the extent of the adherence of the threshold nuclear weapon Powers which it can command.
83.	The Treaty prohibits, besides the manufacture or acquisition otherwise of nuclear weapons by non nuclear-weapon States, all nuclear explosive devices. It does not recognize any difference, since there is no difference, between nuclear weapons and the so called peaceful nuclear explosive devices. Indeed, the provisions of articles I, II and V of the nonproliferation Treaty, as also the statements made by the nuclear Powers, leave no doubt that any State that manufactures a so-called peaceful nuclear explosive device does, in fact, acquire a nuclear weapon. Consequently, the preparations being made in some non nuclear-weapon States to manufacture and explode nuclear devices cannot but be tantamount to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Such a contingency , should it arise, would undoubtedly constitute a qualitatively new situation, endangering not only regional security but also; ultimately, the security of the world. The Pakistan delegation considers it necessary that the General Assembly take cognizance of this impending threat and act to meet it to safeguard the non proliferation regime which it aims to establish.
84.	My delegation welcomes the final draft of the Treaty on the prohibition of the emplacement of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof.7 We hope that the conclusion of this Treaty will be followed as quickly as possible by negotiations under its article V for the prevention of an arms race on the seabed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof.7 We hope that the conclusion of this Treaty in good time and that international machinery will be established to oversee its implementation. My delegation fully endorses the Treaty in its present form and is gratified that it will be adopted at this session.
85.	The continuance of the strategic arms limitation talk. shows that awareness exists on the part of the United States and the Soviet Union of the urgent need for agreement between them on limiting the strategic nuclear arms race before it becomes uncontrollable or imposes crushing economic burdens which either superPower is unable to bear. Last year the General Assembly appealed to them both to agree, as an urgent preliminary measure, on a moratorium on further testing and deployment of new offensive and defensive strategic nuclear-weapons systems. No such agreement has so far come out of the Helsinki and Vienna talks, though they are reported to have been businesslike and pursued in depth.
86.	We earnestly hope that a strategic arms limitation agreement of comprehensive scope, embracing all strategic weapons systems, offensive as well as defensive, will emerge before long through the third round of negotiations in Helsinki. The world cannot but be disappointed if it has to rest content with an agreement confined to mere ceilings on the number of strategic nuclear weapons delivery systems while leaving the deployment of the new systems untouched. Nor are we convinced that either of the superPowers should make agreement dependent on its own subjective assessment of the intentions of the other in relation to tensions and conflicts in one part of the world or another. While such intentions are no doubt relevant to the generation of mutual confidence or otherwise, it appears to us that, so long as limitation of strategic armaments gives no military advantage to one side over the other, it could be put into effect without prejudice to any side's vital interests or security. One must perforce proceed from the assumption that, whatever the disparity in quantitative terms between the superPowers, there will always obtain a qualitative parity. Given this fact and verification of any limitations that might be agreed upon, a common or even parallel approach to political problems need not be made a condition for arriving at an agreement.
87.	In regard to a comprehensive test ban treaty, its link to the strategic arms limitation talks has been put forward as a reason why its conclusion should await the outcome of SALT. But there is an impressive array of experts who hold that underground nuclear weapons tests should be banned even though identification without on-site inspection of explosions under the 4.75 threshold may not be possible. In their opinion, all the technology of nuclear weaponry has already been extracted by the superPowers, and further underground nuclear weapons tests, even of a magnitude above 4.75, are likely to yield only marginal results, in terms of product improvement, which can hardly make a significant difference to the nuclear weaponry of one side vis-a-vis the other.
88.	It is a sombre fact that since the Moscow partial test ban treaty more weapons tests have taken place than before it was concluded, and underground tests have spawned weapons more monstrous than tests in the prohibited environments. It is a tragedy for the world that the three nuclear Powers were unable to compromise their differences on the number of on-site inspections of underground tests when the Moscow Treaty was concluded, thus letting a unique opportunity escape their grasp. They have not had that opportunity again. As a result, both superPowers have condemned themselves and the world to greater insecurity than before though the nuclear arsenal of each has increased manifold.
89.	Pakistan considers it imperative to secure universal adherence to the Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibiting the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons. There is no doubt in our minds that the Protocol prohibits all chemical and biological weapons which may now exist or may be developed in the future. Such weapons are no less a menace to the world than nuclear ones. Indeed, in some respects chemical and bacteriological weapons pose a greater danger as the technology for their production and use is within the reach of most nations of the world.
90.	The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has examined in considerable depth the question of the conclusion of a convention prohibiting the development, production and stockpiling of chemical and biological weapons and also providing for the destruction of such weapons. It is a matter of disappointment that its painstaking efforts have not resulted in a generally agreed text. In our view, the ban should apply to both types of weapons in the same instrument. Obviously, the system of verification and control should be as comprehensive as possible, but no convention could be expected to provide procedures that would guarantee a one hundred percent reliability. All that could be expected is a system which would be reasonably reliable and credible. I would hope that the General Assembly would provide the necessary guidance to the Committee on Disarmament. Time, in this matter, is of the essence.
91.	A serious threat to the independence of the developing countries, and consequently to international peace, is the widening gap between them and the rich nations of the world. It is one of the principal aims of the United Nations to remove this threat by helping to accelerate the economic and social development of the poorer nations. To this end, the Organization is engaged in formulating an international development strategy which is to be implemented in the coming decade. While the formulation of the ten-year perspective program represents a major effort to tackle the pressing priorities of the decade of the 1970s, the strategy in itself is not the panacea of all ills. What is involved is not merely agreement on the specification of objectives, qualitative or quantitative, or on a certain degree of action with regard to policy measures, or the injection of a measure of continuity through an appraisal machinery. These in themselves do not constitute solutions. What is required is, in the words of the Lusaka Declaration, 
'to employ international machinery to bring about a rapid transformation of the world economic system, particularly in the field of trade, finance and technology so that. . . economic strength is used for the benefit of the world community'.
Basic to this requirement is the need to implement these measures by concrete and specific political commitments within the first two years of the decade.
92.	While it has been repeatedly stressed by developing countries that the major responsibility for development is their own, it cannot be doubted that the key to the failure or success of the development strategy lies directly in the hands of the major industrialized nations; for it is they who have the resources to accelerate the economic development of the developing world with the least possible human cost.
93.	Though man may bend his efforts to improve his material condition, yet natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods strike without warning and leave in their wake widespread and sometimes irreparable damage. Foreign Minister  of Turkey has referred to this matter, which is also of current and growing concern to Pakistan. We are conscious of the important and timely steps that have been taken by the United Nations to try to provide much needed assistance to the countries sorely afflicted by such calamities. In recent years, these have befallen Yugoslavia, Tunisia, Romania, Turkey, Iran, Peru and other countries. Pakistan, too, has again been visited by the havoc of floods in its eastern wing in August of this year, causing immense human suffering and destruction. It is imperative, in our opinion, to explore further avenues of effectively mobilizing international assistance material, medical and technical for the relief and rehabilitation of the victims of such disasters. It is also necessary to devise preventive and protective measures against floods and other calamities whenever possible. We welcome and support the Turkish initiative in proposing a new item on this subject for the agenda of this session.
94.	While talking of plans and proposals motivated by a humane vision, I must say that we commend the Iranian proposal [see 1695th meeting, para. 75] to channel the idealism and energy of youth into constructive efforts by the creation of a United Nations peace corps. As the Government of Iran has made clear, it envisions the corps to be composed of the youth of Member nations who would serve in the projects undertaken by the United Nations or started under its auspices.Evidently, it would promote better understanding amongst the members of what the SecretaryGeneral calls 'the takeover generation''[A1800IIAdd. 1 and Corr.l, para. 169].
95.	A little earlier, in the context of strengthening international security, I talked of the right of self determination of peoples and movements of national liberation. Our satisfaction at the progress achieved since the historic resolution 1514 (XV) was adopted must be tempered by the consideration that we are still a long way from the realization of the goals set by the Declaration on decolonization. In southern Africa, particularly, the Declaration has been treated as a dead letter.
96.	Portugal continues to impose its oppressive rule over its colonial territories. The illegal racist minority regime remains entrenched in Rhodesia. In regard to Namibia, the Government of South Africa has defied the authority of the United Nations and has refused to abide by its decisions. Moreover, that Government is not only practicing the odious policies of apartheid in its own country; it has also extended its application to Namibia to maintain white supremacy.
97.	Clearly, this state of affairs is intolerable. For, if the twin evils of colonialism and racialism are not eradicated from southern Africa in time, it is a foregone conclusion that this explosive situation will ignite sooner or later. There is no guarantee that a race war will not spread beyond the confines of Africa and endanger world peace and security.
98.	In this year, which is also the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on decolonization, nothing would be more befitting than reassertion of the collective will of the United Nations to make the Government of South Africa desist from its reckless and inhuman course. This needs, more than anything else, the active support of the major trading partners of South Africa because among them are three permanent members of the Security Council.
99.	Unfortunately, we have witnessed of late a weakening of resolve on the part of some of these permanent members. South Africa is thus enabled not only to expand its economic base, but also to continue augmenting its military strength to become the most powerful State in that region. Since the arms embargo is the principal measure chosen by the United Nations to bring about a reversal of apartheid in South Africa, I hope that the United Kingdom and France will also enforce it scrupulously. We appeal to all Member States to show a willingness to go beyond the halfhearted arms embargo, and to take other measures such as economic sanctions and denial of financial and technical assistance to the Pretoria regime. We appeal to the permanent members of the Security Council to cooperate more actively with other Member States to oust the illegal racist minority regime in Salisbury, to bring an end to Portuguese control of its colonial possessions and to assist the peoples of these Territories to attain their independence. Would it not be tragic if the legitimate strivings of these peoples, suffering under the yoke of colonialism and racialism, are frustrated by the dereliction of some of the permanent members of the Security Council upon whom devolves the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security? I hope thev will realize the grave consequences that will flow from their policy of putting their national economic interests above those of the international community.
100.	I would not conclude this brief survey, from Pakistan's viewpoint of the major problems confronting the world today, without a reference to the Lusaka Declaration issued by the Heads of State or Government of fifty-three nonaligned countries at the conclusion of their conference held earlier this month. We shall not let our non-participation in that conference  for reasons which have now lost their validity or relevance prevent us from commending the Declaration. The views to which it gives forthright expression are similar to those which, out of its own experience, in its own geopolitical setting, and without animosity against any Power or groups of Powers, Pakistan has independently evolved and labored to uphold. I, therefore, consider the present occasion appropriate to convey our felicitations to the Governments of those countries, among which we count many as our close friends.
101.	While at the United Nations much of our attention is focused on the more general causes of instability, there are particular situations of devastation and human misery caused by political conflicts which the United Nations has been unable to alleviate. The continuance of the tragedy of VietNam is a rebuke to the conscience of mankind. The destruction wrought in VietNam over two decades has been colossal and the area of conflict has been widened in the last few months. Certainly, the use of force can be no answer to the problem of VietNam. A whole generation in IndoChina has suffered the agony of a continuing war. Surely, this must end and now. How much more blood needs to be shed before the principle is recognized that this conflict can be settled only in accordance with the wishes of the peoples of IndoChina without outside interference? If at present there is a slim ray of hope, it emanates from the peace talks continuing in Paris. The widely prevalent impression that these talks are stagnant should not obscure the fact that some proposals promising a solution have been advanced in these talks. If such proposals are allowed to wither for lack of receptivity, the world will lose whatever chance still exists for a negotiated solution of this cruel conflict.
102.	Pakistan's views on the Middle East situation have been amply expressed both at the meetings of the Security Council and in the past three sessions of the General Assembly. Based as these views are, not only on our bonds of culture and sentiment with the Arab people, but also on our best objective judgment, they are liable to no change or dilution. The horrifying events in Jordan during the last two weeks have brought us immeasurable grief. How ironical that while the Middle East shook, the United Nations remained immobile, Only the heads of the Arab States concerned worked without respite in Cairo, with the late President Nasser as the untiring host and inspiring guide, to stop the fratricidal slaughter. While one is overwhelmed by the thought of the carnage, while one's heart goes out to the bereaved chief among them, the people of Palestine it is one's duty to draw from, the recent train of events the one lesson that it incontestably conveys, and that is most pertinent for the establishment of a durable peace in the Middle East.
103.	The lesson is this, the heart of the grave Middle East problem, is the problem of Palestine, the problem of a people that was ruthlessly and most unjustly displaced from its homeland, and no settlement of the problem will be lasting if it does not carry the willing consent and acceptance of that people.
104.	To an objective observer, that is all too obvious; yet it is astonishing how easily the diplomacy engaged in finding a settlement loses sight of it. The conflict between the Arab States and Israel, in all its seriousness, is but the effect of a cause. How can the effect be removed unless the cause is eliminated?
105.	While, therefore, we commend the efforts of the four Powers to achieve a settlement, we would be less than honest if we did not warn them that any structure of peace that they erect will rest on quicksand if they try to ignore the hunger for justice which drives the people of Palestine, indeed the entire Arab nation. To expect that any Arab leader, or Government, will acquiesce in a settlement which does not promise restitution of the rights of the people of Palestine is simply to close one's eyes to the realities of the situation. The thousands dead in Amman and here we make no distinction between one Arab and another bear witness to the agony inflicted on the Arab nation by a late product of colonialism, the establishment of Israel and the expansionist policies it has pursued. How can such agony be allowed to endure, and yet hopes be entertained of a stable peace?
106.	I must make it clear that by those observations 1 do not mean to belittle the diplomatic initiatives which were taken recently towards a peaceful settlement. Two facts, however, remain. First, the constructive plan for a temporary ceasefire and for the reactivation of the Jarring mission was obstructed only by Israel's obduracy. Secondly, the potential it held for peace could not be realized unless it envisaged the enlistment of the people of Palestine in efforts towards a settlement. Such enlistment cannot be obtained unless the objectives defined go beyond the mere removal of the consequences of Israel's aggression in 1967, however difficult even that objective might be.
107.	Actually, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Arab territories is something that follows directly from the principle that acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible. Though this principle is but a corollary of the Charter, we must acknowledge that it was the Latin American States which pointedly drew attention to it, in the draft resolution sponsored by them at the emergency special session in 1967,10 as a basis for the settlement of the ArabIsraeli conflict. The principle was emphasized in the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967 [242 (1967)]. No conflict of interpretation regarding that resolution, no selective stress on one part of it as against another, can detract from this
boundaries', but surely it is applicable as much to the Arab States as to Israel, indeed more, because the Arab States do not possess Israel's military capacity and its trained disposition towards taking the offensive. If the principle is unreservedly upheld, a beginning will be made towards peace. Because such a beginning has not yet been made, the situation in the Middle East is fraught with tension and seethes with frustration. Such a climate gives rise to desperate acts, like the hijacking of planes, which, of course, are regrettable and about which the Security Council's resolution of 9 September 1970 [286 (1970)] was quite appropriate.
108.	I must also emphasize that one of the questions included in the Middle East problem is the question of Jerusalem which in its seriousness yields to none. It is a question which, transcending the claims and counterclaims of the parties, concerns the entire Muslim world, as was evidenced by the Islamic summit conference held in Rabat last year and by the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Islamic States held in Jeddah in March last. No solution of this question will facilitate peace and remove the sense of outrage from the Islamic world if it tolerates the placing of the Holy City under Israeli sovereignty or even quasi sovereignty. Any such arrangement would be contrary to the resolutions on Jerusalem which both the General Assembly and the Security Council have adopted since 1967. Again, it would negate the principle of inadmissibility of territorial acquisition by war which the resolutions of the Council emphasize with specific reference to the Holy City.
109.	We urge the great Powers not to be oblivious to the universal religious interest in Jerusalem and the most cherished sensibilities engaged by it.
110.	Though the Middle East and IndoChina are the areas of immediate danger and tension at present, it cannot be said that the subcontinent of India and Pakistan enjoys a dependable peace. Pakistan has urged time and again the imperative of establishing peace based on justice between our country and India, our neighbor. The peace that we visualize is not make believe. We cannot secure peace by evading problems and ignoring the causes of tension. The peace we visualize is not merely a ceasefire. The peace we visualize is one based on the firm foundation of a full recognition of each other's rights, the honoring of mutual agreements, the rejection of expansionist policies and the elimination of the outstanding causes of tension and insecurity.
111.	India and Pakistan are neighbors, which have shared a great deal of historical experience. Differences can, and do, arise between neighbors, but such differences need not generate perpetual hostility. Since our independence, many problems between us, some of which were of a grave character, were resolved but only when we used the time-honored methods of
mutual agreements. The settlement of disputes about the Indus waters and the Rann of Kutch are pertinent examples.
112.	Of all the remaining disputes, it is the one concerning the state of Jammu and Kashmir which has been the outstanding cause of the failure of India and Pakistan to develop a rational relationship that could lead them to harmonious coexistence. And it is with regard to this dispute that India not only is spurning our offers of peace, but is barring every recourse to the methods of peaceful settlement. Could there be a greater example of obduracy than this, that even after nearly a quarter century, the Government of India should fail to realize how essential it is that this dispute be resolved on an equitable basis? When I say 'an equitable basis', I mean the basis that was laid down in the international agreement between India and Pakistan. That agreement resulted from voluntary acceptance, after exhaustive negotiations, by both parties of the recommendations of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan that the future of Jammu and Kashmir be decided by a plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations. The ceasefire in Kashmir and the stationing of United Nations observers were provided for in the same resolutions which envisaged a plebiscite. Time and again we have made it clear that our insistence on the principle of reference to the people is not a matter of taking an inflexible position. How can any solution of this problem be regarded as genuine if it does not carry with it the consent of the people who are the most directly involved I mean, the people of Jammu and Kashmir? These people have made it clear, by their suffering and their continuing resistance, that they are not, and will not be, reconciled to Indian occupation. Their voice may be muffled from the outside world, but it is not inaudible to the people of Pakistan, who are their kith and kin. They and the people of Pakistan both demand that Kashmir be released from its prolonged agony and be enabled to exercise the right of self-determination. In this context, it should not be forgotten that it is to the right of self-determination that both Pakistan and India owe their independent existence today.
113.	Both Pakistan and India have had a grievous experience of alien rule. Both have actively supported the cause of colonial peoples seeking an end to foreign domination. What could be a greater anomaly, a more startling self-contradiction than that while we seek the release of other peoples from alien rule, India should try to impose it on Jammu and Kashmir? Such a course of action is as contrary to India's own proclaimed philosophy as it runs counter to the historical forces of our time. What is more, it cuts at the basis of Asian African solidarity, the essential basis of this solidarity being a common urge of the peoples of the former colonial Territories to determine their own future, and not to permit the emergence of colonialism in newer forms. Belief in racial superiority may have been one of the driving forces of colonialism, but it is not its only cause. A colonial rule can be imposed on a people belonging to the same race. It is such a rule, ruthless and in breach of international commitments, that is being forced by India cn the people of Jammu and Kashmir. When India brought the dispute to the United Nations it did not claim that Kashmir was an integral part of its territory. It does so now. What difference, then, is there between its position and that taken by Portugal in relation to Angola and Mozambique? What difference, I ask, is there between the integration measures adopted by India in Kashmir and those taken by South Africa in Namibia?
114.	The Kashmir dispute has led twice to armed conflict, After the war in 1965, Pakistan has repeatedly urged on India the necessity of entering into meaningful negotiations to resolve this dispute on an equitable basis. India say?>, on the one hand, that it is prepared to have talks with Pakistan on this issue, and, on the other, that there is nothing to talk about. On the one side, friendly Powers are being told that India is ready for negotiations and, on the other, it is being publicly said that the status of Jammu and Kashmir is not negotiable. I put the question to this Assembly: is it fair and is this a helpful attitude for India to take? And while India strikes this self-contradictory posture, it aggravates the situation by taking one measure after another to tighten its vice on Kashmir.
115.	IndiaPakistan relations have been seriously affected by another matter of grave concern to Pakistan's economy, namely, the construction of the Farakka barrage by India on the international river Ganges, which flows through India and Pakistan. That project is designed to divert the waters of the mainstream of the river Ganges through a feeder canal to another river flowing entirely through India. As a consequence, in the long dry season which that region experiences, the barrage will leave little or no water below Farakka for use in East Pakistan, thereby causing grave and permanent damage to the province. International, and our own experts, have assessed the extent and cumulative nature of the damage that will be caused. It is estimated that the project will adversely affect the ecology and agriculture of seven districts in East Pakistan, involving a total area of 3.6 million acres of land. It will seriously affect navigation in the and its many spill channels and distributaries, result in the inflow of sea water thereby affecting agriculture, municipal supplies and industrial uses of the water, depleting fisheries and forest resources especially in the Sundarbans. Moreover, reduced flows in the Ganges downstream from Farakka will silt up the river bed and increase the hazards of flood in the rainy season. These major changes in the environmental and ecological factors of the deltaic region of East Pakistan will have far-reaching and incalculable effects on the livelihood of one third of the population of East Pakistan which is fast approaching 70 million people in an area of only 55,000 square miles.
116.	After encountering many difficulties over a period of years, created by indian demands to furnish data of one kind or another, with which Pakistan regularly complied, and after many meetings at expert and official level, the two Governments agreed in July this year to hold another meeting in three to six months' time to consider the quantum of water to be supplied to Pakistan at Farakka, and the other unresolved issues relating thereto. That meeting is also scheduled to consider matters relating to the eastern rivers which have also been the subject of discussion between the two countries. In pursuance of this positive step, we hope that India will fully cooperate in reaching an equitable solution of this very serious problem. We urge that this problem be approached by India in accordance with a spirit of equity, and recognition of the rights of Pakistan, under international law, to arrive at a solution satisfactory to all concerned.
117.	Over and above the grave political problems in our region, there is one other problem of a purely human character which is extremely poignant. It is the problem of the Muslim minority in India which, though nearly 60 million in number, is scattered all over the country and is the victim of periodic mass killings. The problem has two tragic peculiarities. First, while war, overt or undeclared, in other areas brings barbarities in its train, the killings in India, no less gruesome, take place in a situation where there is no rebellion, no attempt by a minority to establish its own government, no civil war. The Muslims of India have given proof of their loyalty to their country and Government. Yet they are periodically visited by death and destruction. Second, unlike racial groups suppressed in certain countries through the policies of the Governments concerned, the Muslims of India are killed in large numbers in spite of the efforts of the Government of India to stop these eruptions of insensate religious frenzy. I cannot but emphasize this aspect of the problem, because it is not my intention to draw up an indictment against the Government of India. We do not wish to deny that, when thousands of Muslims are killed in a few days as they were at Ahmedabad in September 1969 and in Bhiwandi Jalgaon in May 1970 to cite the more recent instances the Government of India, and responsible Indian leaders, expressed great concern. Let not the representative of India, therefore, treat my remarks on this tragic situation as a subject for polemics. If he intends to say that the Government of India is making efforts to prevent these savage pogroms, I am prepared to concede that point. But the fact remains that these efforts do not match the gravity of the problem. Indeed, they are seldom preventive and never punitive enough. Some time ago, the President of India said that the problem had to be grappled with on a war footing. If his words were translated into action, it is not imaginable that organized hate groups would persist in killing innocent and defenseless Indian citizens who are Muslim. The problem, I repeat, is not an IndoPakistan question in the usual political sense. It is a problem for the universal human conscience. Pakistan, being geographically close to India, cannot but be deeply perturbed, indeed shaken, when an eruption of religious hate in India takes a staggering human toll. Moreover, there exists an international agreement between Pakistan and India, namely, the Liaquat Nehru pact, which makes the safeguarding of the life, culture, property and personal honor of the religious minorities in the two countries a matter of joint concern for the two Governments. Moved by this concern, and saddened by the plight of Muslims in India, Pakistan cannot remain silent.
118.	Our appeal to the Government of India is to ensure the safety of the life, honor and property of Indian Muslims. It would help if the Government of India were to allow an international commission to examine and evaluate the causes of the pogroms, and make recommendations for their eradication. On our part, we shall have no hesitation against, and entertain no fear of, a similar inquiry regarding the minorities in our country.
119.	I cannot close my statement without mentioning the protest of world youth against the present human conditions. Our century has been a stormy one. It has produced tumults, yet generated hopes. Rivers of blood have flowed, but expectations have risen of a better world. Can we of the older generation, who control the sinews of power, claim to have marched a measurable distance towards the goal of improving the lot of man? Have we found answers to the age-old problems of war and racism and poverty even though we command the means of abolishing them through science and technology?
120.	The younger generation finds itself living in a world under the shadow of a nuclear and ecological disaster. It is a world in which man can no longer control the pattern and texture of hh life. His moral purpose is being destroyed by a soulless technology. If the United Nations is to be the answer to the insistence of world youth for a better world order, peace, justice and progress must be translated from empty rhetoric into imperative principles of action.


"
25,1970,COL,"Mr. President, this visit to the United Nations provides me with an opportunity to congratulate you on your well-deserved election by the General Assembly. It is a gesture of recognition of your personal qualifications and of the contribution which your country has made to international cooperation. Colombia is confident that under your expert guidance the General Assembly will successfully complete its work.
2.	This is the first time the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the new Government of Colombia attends this world Assembly. On 7 August last, President Misael Pastrana was constitutionally inaugurated. He was elected by the people of my country in the freest and most closely contested election campaign in the last years, in which a record number of ballots was cast and voters were able to decide the national destiny under the protection of the laws.
3.	The democratic character of this Government is fully in accord with the efforts of {he two national parties to maintain a coalition government and to continue to carry out the social programs, which are the irreversible goal of the new President of Colombia. He is determined to strengthen the achievements that have been gained within law and order, so as to apply an integral agrarian reform, an intensive and well balanced development of our territory and.a gradual and progressive rise in the standard of living of the underprivileged classes.
4.	The experience of the National Front, in existence for twelve years, has been one of the most significant developments in the history of Colombia. In its respect for human rights and constitutional guarantees, it has created an atmosphere favorable to understanding and agreement among all of our political groups. In a disturbed and confused world, shaken by protest and revolution. Colombia has achieved progress, through democratic channels and under the rule of law. We have full confidence in this national consensus and in the sprint of our nations. 
5.	Furthermore, we have well-defined international purposes which support the principles of the United Nations. As a country we have an old and deep-rooted tradition of acting always with the strictest sense of justice and by closely observing the rules of human rights.
6.	The foreign policy of Colombia, since the earliest decades of the nineteenth century, the first years of our independence, has been oriented towards international cooperation. An evidence of this is the missions sent by the liberator and President of the Republic, Simon Bolivar, to various States in America and Europe, to explain the main principles of our new nation and to anticipate the Congress of 1826,  which adopted the first interAmerican Treaty of solidarity, mutual aid and reciprocal respect for sovereignty.
7.	That was the spirit with which we established our national boundaries. In the midst of a lack of knowledge of our geography, it was necessary to track down ancient titles to justify the legal demarcation line and to chase foot by foot the landmarks of a frontier extending over several thousand kilometers. In establishing its borders, Colombia scrupulously followed a juridical criterion and thus gave the supreme example of adherence to international law and to peaceful means. Any territorial disputes with our neighbors were settled in accordance with international law, with no thought of war, invasion or conquest.
8.	It is now many years since our last frontier treaty was signed. When that chapter of our diplomatic history was closed, we looked back with gratitude to the founders of the Republic of Colombia, for it was they who instilled in us the spirit of cooperation and friendship with our neighbors and with all States of our continent. It was they who proclaimed clearly the Colombian doctrine of judicially established frontiers, specifically those of uti possidetis juris of 1810, by which the nations that inherited the Spanish dominions were recognized as rightful owners of the territories of the various general captaincies and vice-royalties. It was this doctrine that very largely regulated the demarcation of frontiers in our hemisphere.

9.	Our national sovereignty is defined and limited by law. The ambition to which we have adhered through
the years has been the observance of international law, which is the supreme rule for justice among peoples. It is thus possible for us who are today members of the Colombian Government to state that we do not covet any territory other than that which has been assigned to us legitimately by border treaties and international agreements, as, for instance, those related to our continental shelf and our fishing zone J. Every inch of our land is acknowledged as ours by treaties which we finally succeeded in working out through friendly agreements. We should like to follow the same procedures with our neighbors regarding the delineation of the marine and submarine areas.
10.	In the first century of their existence the Latin American countries lived apart from international life, involved as they were in internal strife, and after the epic of liberation came the need for our countries of the Western Hemisphere to settle complicated differences over frontiers. Now, in the twentieth century, Latin America has an international personality and is proud to come to this Assembly of the United Nations with her theses on law, human dignity and economic justice among peoples.
11.	Latin America, in our opinion, has a lofty mission in world gatherings: to plead unceasingly for international cooperation, for the rule of law and justice and for better treatment for the developing peoples, as the basis for world balance. We are not satisfied with what has been done so far and we feel obliged to say so within this Organization, because of the grave situations which we see throughout the world.
12.	We have adhered to the ideals and methods of international cooperation both at the regional level and at the wider level of the United Nations, and now we find strong reasons to warn that the period of the isolation of peoples is over and that they are bound to join hands to undertake the works of peace, the very pressing task of preventing war and the equally urgent duty of extending economic and social justice throughout the world.
13.	No spot on earth is immune from attack. The Second World War was a clear demonstration of that fact, which is no longer disputed by anybody in this age of technology and science, when man has succeeded in his greatest adventure to travel to other spaces. Since then the destructive power of weapons has been perfected to the utmost, and our planet seems smaller than ever before, more densely populated and more exposed to the danger of universal devastation. At the same time, the needs of the underdeveloped peoples cannot wait. If the arms race is not stopped, we would face ominous harbingers and the not entirely unimaginable danger that what are now local wars may escalate into more general wars.
14.	The indispensable cooperation between peoples and States requires, of course, certain conditions without which it would be a vain purpose or an empty word. States must completely accept the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, in particular to refrain from using threats or force against the territorial integrity or the political independence of any State and always to act according to international law and to apply the procedures for the peaceful resolution of differences. Wherever illegal force is used there is a weakening of the noble concept of international cooperation so dear to all peoples of all nations.
15.	The dilemma of force versus law, of violence as a means to dominate other nations or against their self determination in choosing their national destinies and forms of government, which will best respond to their national criterion, whether social or political, is an accurate moral x-ray of the disquiet of our time and the summary of the past twenty--five years of history. After the Second World War ended, we did not see that era of peace and justice for which everyone yearned. We saw only a continuation of violence and the subordination of some States by others. It can be said that this Organization was born in the middle of a tremendous drama of mankind, when the war had not yet ended, and it was impossible to implant cooperation among all nations. We have yet to see the attainment of such aims as a just peace firmly established and peoples living together in freedom.
16.	Whereas technology and science reveal astonishing progress we have hardly advanced at all in the field of human relations. Yet we know where the essential values lie. There is no cooperation without respect for international law and respect too for self determination and the dignity of the individual. The United Nations is itself founded on the belief that all the Member States agree on certain fundamental principles.
17.	Let us recall Pascal's words: 'Force without law is tyranny, and law without force is impotence.'
18.	The United Nations should initiate without delay a process of honest self-criticism of its potentialities and achievements in collective security and the maintenance of peace. The twenty-five years during which the Charter of the Organization has been in force prove the ineffectiveness of the system adopted in San Francisco to 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war'.
19.	There has been a glaring contradiction between the law and the harsh reality endured by people in some regions of the world where they suffer the bitter insecurity of poverty, where freedom is unknown, where war is the natural atmosphere in which generations are being raised. Nor have crises been lacking to show up the deficiencies of the system, because the organisms entrusted with the preservation of peace have been powerless to prevent such situations or have had insufficient authority to bring about an adequate solution. In the Middle East and in Asia there are wars, which public opinion is becoming accustomed to considering as an endemic state or a permanent situation, while acts of piracy provoke universal protest.
20.	We are witnesses to an undeniable deterioration of the peaceful procedures of international law, already fallen into disuse with the 'cold war' episodes, the visible opposition between two blocs of countries separated by conflicting ideologies and situated in major zones of influence. The United Nations then lost a large part of its authority because of the unfortunate precedents created, and the Charter of the United Nations became an ineffective instrument. Although it is true that, after these twenty-five years of international tensions, we do perceive friendly contacts between States on both sides of the iron curtain.
21.	Certain other factors are not contemplated in the United Nations Charter. Such are the undeclared wars which erupt and are waged without formal announcements and which international organizations decide, with an excess of optimism, to consider that they do not exist. Then too there is the contemporary phenomenon of indirect aggression. This is perpetrated in various ways, sometimes, as war propaganda against another sovereign State, sometimes as instigations, so that improvised armies will disturb the internal peace and development of another country. Methods of creating violence have multiplied to such an extent throughout the world that the fundamental problem of the United Nations is, first of all, to restore confidence in its procedures among peoples.
22.	Yet the real and very grave problem of the vacuums in the collective security system is caused by the failure of a number of procedures which have been replaced by force of arms. The pyramid of armaments, which crushes humanity under its ruthless weight, has replaced collective security based on law and, unfortunately, what prevails now is the might of the strongest rather than the United Nations Charter. Let this be said clearly.
23.	The problem of collective security is a very serious one and should be examined without delay by the Member States of the United Nations, unless we wish to see the total collapse of a great ideal. We have reached the lowest point of incredulity in a system in which we all stand staring at' 'the balance of terror'', which looms over us like a menacing specter which we should like to be forever removed.
24.	Faced with the absence of a general system of collective security it becomes even more imperative for countries to improve regional* agreements. In America at least and in our hemisphere we find a series of principles which cover legal equality among States, the obligation of nonintervention and solidarity against any kind of aggression and armed attack. These are the result of a lengthy evolution in our continental relations.
25.	Not only can we not refrain from applying these principles and methods of our regional system, but Colombia is furthermore determined to strengthen it, to extend it and endow it with the means to cope with the changing circumstances of the contemporary world, and to fulfill the guiding fundamental axiom of the Chapultepec Conference of 19452 which states that international law shall be the rule of conduct for all
States. In America we have outlawed war, as the antiwar treaty of nonaggression and conciliation of 1933 records, and we have established regional collective security by the interAmerican treaty of reciprocal assistance of 1947. 
26.	Regional agreements are, at this juncture in the life of nations, the indispensable complement of the theoretical and furthermore inoperative worldwide collective security system. Colombia expounded this view at the San Francisco Conference, and we reiterate it, after decades of lack of action, unresolved crises and downright failures. We can now appreciate the historic significance of the debate at San Francisco. We did not want for warnings as to the general collective security system, entrusted as it was to a minority group of Great Powers in the Security Council, each of them having obtained the power to paralyse any decision of this body.
27.	It is quite true that the United Nations Charter was not drawn up in San Francisco in its entirety: it reached us with its essential, its most fundamental chapters dealing with the preservation of peace and with security already worked out. That explains why Colombia insisted so strenuously in 1945 to obtain confirmation of the regional agreements. It is a fact that certain great Powers had taken it upon themselves to assume responsibility for framing the future statute of the world Organization, as though called upon to do so, at the Conferences of Yalta in 1945 and Dumbarton Oaks in 1944. The countries that did not belong to that exclusive and powerful group had no choice but to agree to a whole series of rules to which no amendments of any kind were considered admissible,
28.	In San Francisco the tenacity of my country and of the American States, which backed up the ideas fervently and rightly championed by the chief of the Colombian delegation, our former President Alberto Lleras, did make it possible with regard to Article 52 on regional agreements to add paragraphs 2 and 4, and particularly paragraph 2, which invites States participating in such agreements to 'make every possible effort to achieve pacific settlement of local disputes through such regional arrangements or by such regional agencies before referring them to the Security Council'.
29. The experience of these twenty-five years has proved Colombia to have been right in firmly insisting on the need to preserve the integrity of such regional agreements as are compatible with the Charter of the United Nations and to make full use of them in the interests of peace and security. In several continents these agreements are clear guidelines for the security of numerous States in facing difficult circumstances, and at times when such situations are rendered desperate by aggression and intervention, which would otherwise have meant submission to the cumbersome machinery of the Security Council. 

30.	Moreover, Article 51 of the United Nations Charter recognizes the rights of Member States of the Organization, including naturally the American countries, to act individually and collectively in self defense ' 'until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security'. The chief of the delegation of Colombia at the San Francisco Conference explained the situation in the following words:
'If at any given time an armed attack should occur, that is to say, an act of aggression against a Member State of a regional group, then self-defense, either individual or collective, exercised as an inherent right, shall automatically operate within the terms stated by the Charter, until such time as the Security Council might impose the appropriate sanctions against the aggressor country.
'In the case of the American States, aggression against an American State constitutes aggression against all the American States, and in supporting the State attacked all States will be exercising their right of legitimate self-defense in order to repel the aggression. This is what is called the right of legitimate collective defense.' 
31.	One of the items on the agenda of the General Assembly is the 'Need to consider suggestions regarding the review of the Charter of the United Nations'. Colombia attaches particular importance to this problem, because we are convinced of the urgency of the task of aggiornamento of the Organization, which has become prematurely old in twenty-five years.
32.	The mere proliferation of new States calls for criteria to evaluate their capacity to assume responsibilities in this Organization. The 'miniState' is a phenomenon which requires a certain amount of study if we wish to avoid excessive improvisation of judicial persons who aspire to act as sovereign entities. On the other hand, there are certain complex situations, the existing realities of which we should at least begin to consider, so that within a few decades we will not be accused of having established within the United Nations the image of an international community, arbitrarily cut up, without the participation of important States.
33.	In the world today, even the oldest and the most venerable institutions and beliefs of peoples have had to undergo revisions in keeping with the times. There is a concept of change that obliges every institution to take into account new social circumstances. Besides, unceasing evolution is a natural phenomenon in law. AngloSaxon jurists recognize it in their Common Law, and no code can be exempt from a day-to-day interpretation of jurisprudence.
34.	One could say a great deal perhaps even too much about the shortcomings of the United Nations Charter. It might not be amiss to specify the most conspicuous of them. We need, for example, first a reaffirmation of the principles of international law which concern good relations among States; secondly, an effective system to prevent war and to determine the aggressor; thirdly, a guarantee of the actual existence and defense of human rights; and, fourthly, the adoption of procedures for the peaceful settlement of international disputes in order finally to abolish war.
35.	However, our immediate desires do not go so far and take into account reality. Indeed, Colombia's proposals are within the limited possibilities that we deem attainable at this time. We have preferred to postpone a discussion of subjects which, on account of their scope and many-sided implications, would require previous acceptance by the majority of this Assembly. We accept as a fact the much-discussed mechanism of the Security Council. At the same time, we observe, not without anguish, that the unchecked decaying of the procedures and institutions of the United Nations Charter becomes more notorious from year to year.
36.	We should like to find a way to achieve universality for the United Nations. This is a first purpose in response to the idea of a world system of peace and justice, as well as to the nature of certain problems which cannot be solved in the absence of the countries concerned. We need a procedure that will add both flexibility and effectiveness to the principle in the United Nations Charter, whereby it is provided that 'membership in the United Nations is open to . . . peace-loving States which accept the obligations contained in the . . . Charter and, in the judgment of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out these obligations'.
37.	In the field of collective security, the enunciation of initiatives is not an easy task without first altering the Security Council machinery, which is the engine of the system. We consider, however, that it would be useful to suggest a more categorical implementation of the regional agreements for the maintenance of peace. In most cases when disagreements between States arise, the problem for the United Nations is to prevent an immediate confrontation between the great Powers, and to this end regional agreements should be resorted to for the implementation of conciliatory action, as provided for in Article 33 of the Charter. This procedure would leave in the hands of the parties concerned in the conflict area a choice of the most suitable peaceful means to find a solution without having to fear intervention by the great Powers. We are seeking a stricter interpretation of Article 52 of the Charter in such a way that it would be essential for Member States of the United Nations before appealing to the Security Council, to work out a peaceful settlement of their local or regional disputes through any agreements previously subscribed to by them. This transfer of mandate from the Council to the regional organizations would make the former a supreme and second instance at which the dispute in question could be examined and settled.
38.	We wish to have the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter left unchanged, since those States which have the greatest responsibility for the maintenance of peace should not be deprived of their capacity to act on behalf of the United Nations and, on express recommendation of the Security Council at times of extremely serious threats to peace, breaches of the peace or acts of aggression. This would not mean that the Council, as provided for in Article 53, might not make use of the regional agreements if it should deem this more appropriate.
39.	In the second place, we recommend more active participation by the International Court of Justice in the work of peace. It is undeniable that that high Court has been kept completely apart from the collective security system and its action has been confined to the arbitration of occasional disputes. In view of its vested authority and multinational character and in view also of the fact that it represents the different legal traditions of the Members of the United Nations, the Court could also pass judgment on the strictly legal aspects of international disputes by an emergency procedure open to all States without exception, whether or not they are Members of the United Nations.
40.	Our ideas for possible revision of parts of the Charter in certain specific aspects are submitted by Colombia to Governments represented at this Assembly for consideration, so that we may review with them all the factors of the problem and find the most adequate solutions in order to install new life into the United Nations.
41.	Colombia is particularly interested in the subject of the law of the sea. The General Assembly, in accordance with resolution 2574 A (XXIV), should consider the desirability of convening a conference on such an important subject. We can state in advance that we are ready to participate actively in the necessary preparatory work.
42.	A great deal of progress has been made in establishing principles either unknown or ignored in 1945, when the President of the United States, Mr. Harry S. Truman, issued an important proclamation, which prompted similar proclamations by other States to claim jurisdiction in some cases, and in others to claim sovereignty of the State over the continental shelf, the criterion being based on different geographical and legal considerations. This was an era marked by anarchy in the development of the law of the sea.
43.	The American States were the first to establish adequate regional doctrines in this respect. The Inter American Council of Jurists declared, as early as 1956, among other postulates, that 'the distance of three miles as the limit of territorial waters is insufficient, and does not constitute a general rule of international law'. And it adds, consequently, that 'the enlargement of the zone of the sea traditionally called 'territorial waters' is justifiable'. The resolution adopted in Ciudad Trujillo that year, at the InterAmerican Special Confer*, nee on Conservation of Natural Resources: the Continental Shelf and Marine Waters,  included the principle of the Convention of 1958 on the Continental Shelf which reads as follows:
'The seabed and subsoil of the continental shelf, continental and insular terrace, or other submarine areas, adjacent to the coastal State, outside the area of the territorial sea, and to a depth of 200 meters or, beyond that limit, to where the depth of the super adjacent waters admits of the exploitation of the natural resources of the seabed and subsoil, appertain exclusively to that State and are subject to its jurisdiction and control.'
In 1958 the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  adopted four international conventions which refer to the main aspects of this question, namely, territorial waters and adjacent zones; the high seas, fishing and the conservation of the natural resources in the high seas; the continental shelf.
44.	At the Ciudad Trujillo Conference in 1956, Colombia expressly requested international cooperation in the solution of marine problems and announced that, in order to ease the way to unify points of view and eliminate divergences it would 'abstain from adopting unilateral regulations'. It would have been easy for Colombia to follow the example of other countries by formulating a unilateral statement as to its rights to the continental shelf or its adjacent zone, but Colombia preferred to await the outcome of the United Nations Conference held in 1958, and to incorporate its principles in the conventions which were adopted and signed there. We were consistent with our past attitude in determining territorial sovereignty, and abiding by the rules of the law were content simply to wait to cooperate with all nations in a general conference.
45.	There can be no mistake. International cooperation is the only way to avoid situations of insoluble difficulty, a searching for clear rules as to the extent of the rights of States. This indispensable cooperation has produced such lofty principles as those proclaimed by the International Convention on the Continental Shelf, which makes it clear that a coastal State exercises exclusive sovereign rights over the areas referred to in that instrument for the purposes of exploration and development of natural resources.
46.	Nevertheless, progress in the science of oceanography has left far behind certain rules of the Convention of the Continental Shelf, in which the right of sovereignty was envisaged as extending to 200 meters or, if possible, still further, without setting a limit to the exploitation or exploration of the natural resources of these zones. Furthermore, there is the Latin American consensus which grants the coastal State equally exclusive rights over the living resources of the part of the sea nearest its coast. TTiere is an unequivocal need to complement this 1958 Convention with new and explicit provisions in the light of the most recent experience. 
47.	Therefore, Colombia is in favor of the idea of convening a general conference of Member States of the United Nations to carry on the work discontinued since 1958. We desire this provided that, at the next meeting, due consideration will be given to all the various factors to which we have referred and which constitute an indivisible whole. On looking back upon the unilateral statements following President Truman's 1945 proclamation, we see them as completely outdated. International cooperation is opportune and, indeed, indispensable, so as to lead to the adoption of new rules that will take into account the needs of all countries.
48.	We shall therefore give preferential attention to the important proposal made in 1970 by the President of the United States, Mr. Richard Nixon, on the possible exploration and exploitation of the ocean floor by a community of closely associated nations, in such a way as to respect the interests of the coastline State and to obtain a source of investments to assist the developing countries.
49.	In respect to the law of the sea, Colombia has adhered strictly to the principles of international law and will continue to do so. Were we to act otherwise, we would be breaking with our past tradition of asserting our sovereignty and claiming maritime rights of domain only in so far as we are authorized to do so by international conventions and public treaties.
50.	Colombia is not merely a country of mountains and wide open spaces, both veined by many rivers; Colombia is also a land with long coastlines washed by two oceans; it needs to delve into the riches of the seas to benefit its people. This represents nothing more than a consequence of obvious international principles.
51.	The twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations is celebrated amidst the distress of the peoples of a host of developing countries. It is a chapter in which we cannot conceal the gravity of the problems which confront us. They were not foreseen in all their vast dimensions at the San Francisco Conference, nor in the Bretton Woods Agreements.9
52.	In the last few months numerous and very learned reports have examined the chief factors of the shortcomings in the aid to the developing countries. It is now a generally admitted and un-contradicted truth that the present world is divided into industrialized and poverty stricken zones. This great economic gap of our time widens every day with the existence of two price rates, one for industrial goods and another for the raw or semi-finished materials of the developing countries.
53.	A world divided into two very different zones, makes us think back to a description in the work Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations written in 1776 by the British economist Adam Smith. It shows the consequences of the discovery of the New World, which gave rise to an opening up of markets
'Signed at Washington, D.C. on 27 December 1945.
for the goods of Europe and progress in the arts and industry of that continent, in exchange for the precious metals of the New World, extracted in the midst of the rusticity and poverty of the inhabitants of that region. We see, then, that the gap in economic development goes back a long way.
54.	We would have to add other considerations. The areas most in need of development have been deprived of the immense capital invested in the sophisticated technology of the artifacts of death. While expenditures on intercontinental missiles increase constantly, the volume of aid to the developing countries has so steadily been declining that it is now at the 1961 level. The United Nations has doubtless made an effort to relieve the situation but it can hardly feel satisfied with the disappointing results of the first Development Decade, which ended in 1970.
55.	In his report to the first session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 1964, Mr. Raul Prebisch stated:
'One of the main objectives of the United Nations Development Decade is the attainment of a minimum annual growth rate of 5 per cent in the income of the developing countries by 1970. This is certainly a rather modest target and not much higher than the average rate of 4.4 per cent registered in the 1950s. Nevertheless, it will be extremely difficult if not impossible for many of the developing countries to achieve and maintain this rate of growth unless the present Conference brings about a policy of international cooperation that would make it possible to eliminate the imbalance in trade.' 
56.	That rate of 5 per cent per annum really meant something much less in the average per capita earnings in the peripheral countries. Even though the goals were so modest they were not attained nor was implementation of the recommendations attained, such as the one that the industrialized nations set aside 1 per cent of the gross national product of each of them to aid the developing areas. The point we have reached has been graphically described in the Pearson report  with these figures: 34 per cent of the world population, composed of industrialized nations, received 87.5 per cent of the gross national product of all countries; 66 per cent of the world population, corresponding to the group of less developed countries, received barely 12.5 per cent of the above mentioned gross national product; 22 per cent of the world population live in the less developed countries, where per capita income was less than 1 per cent per annum; 48 per cent obtained from 1 to 2 per cent and only 30 per cent of the outside countries have exceeded 2 per cent.
57.	The foreign debt of the developing countries, created by large export credits and development aid, has rapidly increased to almost 50 billion dollars, while the servicing of these debts has increased at the rate of 17 percent per annum, according to the Pearson report, which was drawn up by a high ranking commission of experts of the World Bank. The first Development Decade does not offer much reason for enthusiasm in most countries.
58.	Given these figures we cannot fail to see that the Second Development Decade will be decisive for the fate of both the developed and the developing areas of the world, since neither can remain isolated from the other. Prosperity beside poverty is bound to provoke an upheaval. The effects are already perceptible in the outbreaks of nonconformity and violence in various parts of the world. The problem of trade in the developing countries is one which cannot be postponed. Possibly it is more important, in the long run, than the problem of aid itself. If the multilateral machinery for assistance is to be improved, there must be an effective increase in the contributions of capital.
59.	If the world maintains the present cleavage between rich and poor countries, and if, moreover, the exclusive commercial blocs favoring some countries and making outsiders of others are consolidated then the international situation cannot but show in the Second Development Decade a balance of frustration and disappointment far more alarming than that of the first.
60.	Colombia has come to this world Assembly to renew its great hope in the United Nations. Every human endeavor is subject to the storms of time. Nor should we forget that the effects of several centuries of enmity and misunderstanding among peoples cannot suddenly vanish like a midsummer night's dream. Despite the shortcomings we have pointed out, the United Nations is called upon to tackle a superhuman task.
61.	Progress cannot be measured in terms of months and years but in terms of decades and centuries. To arrive at the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, in 1789, entire centuries of personal suffering had to be borne, and tyranny brought to the point of utter weariness. Democracy did not spring up overnight as though by magic. It was a progressive movement in the minds of people, while the ideas of Utopians and the thoughts of philosophers perforated like drops of water the wall of misunderstandings and the stony deafness of the leaders, until the time came when there was a great overthrow of the institutions.
62.	The United Nations is the creature of a Utopia of brotherhood and a philosophy of concord among peoples with respect for the rules of international law, which little by little are finding the arduous way to positive achievement. These mostly lie ahead. What we now perceive appears imperfect. But that which existed yesterday was even further removed from the ideal we cherished. Mankind in 1970 will, on looking back, become aware of the fact that we have laid the foundations for a future world organization, based on the active participation of all peoples in the management of the community of nations.
63.	Just now we find ourselves at a moment of evolution. The United Nations has seen that its structures need changing. This signifies an intellectual process of adaptation to changes in international ideas, whose aims are the abolition of racial discrimination, the suppression of social injustice, the strengthening of peaceful methods to solve controversies, and disarmament, as a prelude to security.
64.	Security, disarmament and the peaceful settlement of disputes, were three intentions that won acclaim on the conclusion of the First World War. They were the signals of hope. Today we reiterate those purposes and add to them the clamors of a destitute mankind so that, through international cooperation, we may find effective means for harmonious development on all continents, together with social justice and respect for human rights. The United Nations is still a land of hope for a better world.


"
25,1970,HTI,"1.	  Mr. President, I hardly need to emphasize the unanimity surrounding your election to preside over these meetings. Impartiality, competence, clear-sightedness and discernment these are the master qualities which my colleagues and I believe to be essential for a President of the United Nations General Assembly, and we are convinced that you have the outstanding privilege of possessing them in large measure. It was easy for you, therefore, to promise to work dispassionately, with maximum objectivity and to adopt a working method that would enable us to reach both concrete and valid results.
2.	I would be failing in my duty were I not to congratulate the outgoing President, Mrs. Angie Brooks Randolph, UnderSecretary of State of the Government of Liberia, an old hand in the United Nations where she has been militant for a number of years, interested in all questions, including social and women's problems. The second representative of black Africa Ambassador Alex QuaisonSackey of Ghana was the first to have presided over the General Assembly of the United Nations, she was a credit to her country, to the race and to the sex which she so worthily represents. Her qualities as a diplomat and her sense of authority, as well as her respect for the opinions of others, her direct and smiling frankness, have made their mark in the annals of the Presidency of the General Assembly. She can withdraw satisfied at having brilliantly accomplished the mandate that was entrusted to her by Governments and her colleagues. Glory and honour be to her.
3.	And, to you, Mr. President, my best wishes for success in your task, as well apeople and the Government of His Excellency Dr. Francois Duvalier, Life President of Haiti.
4. I shall now read out a declaration of His Excellency the Life President of the Republic of Haiti on the occasion of the commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.
'twenty-five years ago, on 26 June 1945, in San Francisco, nations differing both in race and culture, but animated by a spirit without frontiers which restored them to their original vocation, which was so noble, of peoples united for the wellbeing of man, resolved 'to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind'.
'Twice in the space of one lifetime! How can we fail to see the tremendous impact it has had and the confusion it has generated in the world, which is always looking for conditions of survival for humanity? How many times have the crises and the audacity of temperament increased man's anxiety as he is confronted with the problems of his destiny?
'How much suffering, how many refusals multiplied by the risk of bloody confrontations which simply serve to increase universal distress and always bring home to man the extent of his frailty? 
'To these confused appeals, thrown out in the endless night of suffering, and misery, full of horror and terror, to these appeals which have become so urgent, the Charter of the United Nations  brought and will continue to bring the reply that of the aspirations, the principles, the truths which make man greater in stature, which liberate him from all the constraints and all the prejudices which he has, and make him a citizen of the world devoted to seeking peace, justice and progress.
'Thus, the Charter of the United Nations, by proclaiming the imperative necessity for achieving these objectives as prerequisite for international equilibrium, has left on all geographical areas the mark of an organization of planet wide dimensions.
'It is precisely the facility of communications which is making the world smaller and smaller, all frontiers now touching each other, and making it a place where disturbances, wherever they occur, necessarily concern all communities,
A/PV.1851
'The fact is that man, by exploring all space, has become the giant of civilization and, by reason of his great stature and mental powers, by dominating the physical universe he can glimpse in the error and paralyzing fatality of the spirit of hatred and division the tragic prospect of disintegration. And today no one who is truly committed to universal association, now more closely knit than ever, can believe that he is not involved in the success and the failure of what it does.
'What responsibility can override that for peace?
'For some time now the peoples have believed that the risk of war could be removed only by intensive rearmament and by effective alliances consisting of a leadership whose existence would involve heavy dependence, when it is not dearly bought by the slaughter of human life and the loss of wealth.
'Enumerating the apocalyptic scourges involving the massive production of arms and modern engines of destruction, which are only waiting for the right moment to sow death and destruction, has not removed the desire for power on all fronts where the diplomacy of presence, far from strengthening the conditions of coexistence among States, rather run over a spirit of division and competition, which are so favorable to the war industries.
'Thus polarization has hardened spheres of influence which are maintained in a continual state of potential confrontation, aggravated by local conflicts, by aggression, by occupations, by brutal interventions and all other forms of interference. The column of peace, to this extent, has been shaken; international security has thus been threatened.
'Thus, when will peoples learn from the luminous thoughts traced in the Charter of the United Nations, and when will they be able to preserve the international community from the scourge of war, which has been defined in all the conscience of man as the breakup of the immutable order of the world, the order of peace, which is the necessary fulcrum for the realization of man's ideals.
'It is equally striking that in the hours of major crisis, in those hours where folly reigns and the least false step would cast humanity to the bottom of the abyss, all eyes are turned towards this world Organization.
'Whether it be the powder barrel of the Middle East, whether it be the unfortunate war of VietNam, the threats of thermonuclear, chemical or bacteriological warfare, men of goodwill, and those peoples who are wedded to peace, expect from the United Nations a solution to their anguish.
'One is astonished, one is irritated at its slowness, at its spirit of caution. These are undeniable signs of its moral prestige and its vocation as a guardian of our ultimate hopes of peace.
'But will the unhappy years of the cold war, during which the United Nations served as a platform for recriminations among the great Powers, only remain a bad memory, and will the Organization resolutely turn itself towards those decisions which have been taken in the light of the principles of its Charter, and will it succeed in realizing them?
'Seen from this angle, the indirect talks which have been marked by a number of vicissitudes which have been undertaken by the parties involved in the conflict in the Middle East, constitute the touchstone of the effectiveness of the new direction taken by the Organization. Will it be able victoriously to emerge from this test?
'In the matter of building for peace, the blue helmets of the United Nations have also played an important part in a number of difficult parts of the world, where their actions prevented major confrontations. The United Nations has to its credit also the elaboration of peace treaties designed to ensure that peace reigns more than ever indivisibly. One example from many could be quoted: a timid step has been taken towards disarmament. The Moscow Treaty prohibiting tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water  was signed and ratified by more than 100 States.
'My Government, for its part, will never cease, in the case of racial and international conflicts, to launch appeals for conciliation and understanding. For how much more love and brotherhood will be needed to build a world based on peace and also a more just world?
'Faith in the fundamental rights of man, faith in the dignity and value of the human personality, and the equality of rights of men and women, as well as those of large and small nations, all this would bring about a new era if the authority of the Organization were to become more luminous, stronger and better defined at every succeeding step it takes as it continually draws its inspiration from the actions and legislation of peoples and their governments.
'The monument of the new form of international law, the so-called United Nations law, is being enriched by the work of the bodies and the commissions of the world parliament, which are of inestimable value for the international community.
'The membership of the Organization has been swelled by new Members, the number of which has tripled in less than a quarter of a century. Could we seek a better illustration of the principle of equality of men and peoples, whatever be their color, whatever be their race or their religion.
'Should we not also here recall, for the benefit of those who preach inequality of races, a certain number of important conclusions which were formulated on 26 September 1965 in a declaration devised by experts in social science and the humanities, working under the auspices of UNESCO:
'(«) All men living today belong to the same species and descend from the same stock;
'(&) The division of the human species into 'races' is partly conventional and partly arbitrary and does not imply any hierarchy whatsoever...;
'(c) Current biological knowledge does not permit us to impute cultural achievements to differences in genetic potential ... The peoples of the world today appear to possess equal biological potentialities for attaining any level of civilization. 
'The world Organization, of course, has not succeeded in eradicating certain scourges, such as apartheid. But it has been able to mobilize, against these scourges, the universal awareness of the world and victoriously to combat the most grievous forms of discrimination, and to prevent the continuation of age old injustices, and it has contributed to the downfall of colonialism, which was based on the false concept of the inequality of the races and assertion that people had unequal aptitudes for self government.
'Regarding the progress of the United Nations, an Organization which is essentially political in its purposes, we have seen its vigorous promotion in a number of specialized agencies: FAO, with its green revolution, has been able to remove the specter of famine, which is a corollary of the extraordinary demographic explosion which is seen in our days; WHO, always anxious about the health of populations, always ready to undertake action to combat the least threat of an epidemic, does not neglect combating those endemic diseases which are the formidable legacy of a less fortunate past; UNESCO, equally, is working in the field of culture and education.
'Furthermore, can we overlook the work which has been done by financial organizations for aid and development and the economic and commercial groups: the Economic Commission for Latin America, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the International finance Corporation and the laudable efforts made by the Economic and Social Council, one of the Councils enjoying most prestige in the Organization and which is in charge of development planning and the economic and social wellbeing of Member States?
'Much more than this, the United Nations, by acting in a constructive and dynamic way, has already decreed a first Development Decade, that of the sixties, the objectives which have not yet been completely achieved, unfortunately.
'The Second Decade, that of the seventies, draw ing impetus from the first one. will, we hope, meet with fewer setbacks, provided that it encounters international cooperation which is devoid of sordid self-interest, and fixed goals may be achieved: an
annual development of a minimum of 6 per cent for the gross national products of the developing countries, an increase of 3.5 per cent in the gross national product per inhabitant and fixed development targets in agriculture, savings, imports, exports and the various social sectors.
'After its 25 years of life as an institution, compared with the life of a people, or that of certain human institutions, this may seem little, but it counts for a lot at the level of international organization which is caught in the crossfire of antagonistic forces. The United Nations can consider with some pride what has already been accomplished.
'With remarkable constancy it has applied itself to achieving the noble goals which it assigned itself, and we cannot blame it for the fact that it has been feeling its way sometimes and has not finished all it has started. Man is imperfect and is drawn towards the heights, but sometimes he is kept at the lower reaches of the foothill of the mountain because of the heavy past heritage of selfishness, violence and ill-controlled compulsions.
'Haiti, the first independent black republic in the world, the second is.dependent State of the continent, and elder daughter of the French revolution, entered into history with the noble influx of the ideals of 1789. Never in its existence has it ceased to proclaim its attachment to the freedom, brotherhood and equality which, during the strife torn epoch of 1804, galvanized the suffering classes of Santa Domingo, slaves who had been taken out of Africa and those who knew that freedom from slavery existed. Eloquent proof of this is Savannah, in the state of Georgia, where 600 Haitians, among them Henri Christophe, future king of Haiti, paid in blood for the cause of the liberation of the thirteen British colonies in America, and the generous assistance given to Simon Bolivar, the immortal liberator, by the fathers of our independence, Jean Jacques Des salines and Alexandre Petion, during the great adventure of becoming emancipated from the Spanish yoke of the so-called Bolivarian peoples.
'Haiti is proud of belonging to the United Nations and to the Organization of American States, which in their different spheres are working towards the emancipation of man from fear and constraint. It has endorsed their principles, norms and noble objectives and unreservedly cooperates in their achievement.
'Regarding public and individual freedoms, they have, during an evolution covering 166 years of history, been written into a legislation which completely guarantees essential rights in all areas. It is embodied in the administration of social justice of the immortal Dumardais Estime and it reached full maturity under the present Government. Both those Governments were installed in power by the social revolutions, of 1946 and 1957, carried out for the benefit of the majority.
'The conquests of these two revolutions were crystallized in the labor code of Frangois Duvalier, which is a genuine monument of labor legislation, the rural code of Francois Duvalier, and in a number of advanced social institutions such as the Institute of Social Insurance, the Institute of Old Age Pensions, a number of reeducation institutions, and the Organization for National Literacy and Community Action all enshrined in the Constitution of 1964.
'This Constitution defines the State of Haiti as an indivisible republic, sovereign, independent and social. It guarantees, under Title II, the rights of all classes of citizens; under Title III, the duties corresponding to those rights; under Titles IX and XIII, the economic and social system; and it organizes the harmonious functioning of the chief authorities of the State and their respective prerogatives.
'Briefly, that is the state of social legislation and human rights legislation in a country whose enemies, egged on by political exiles, genuine exiled princes, have tried to depict as a country of arbitrariness erected into a system, so true is it that underlying their iniquitous actions one can see some and perhaps a lot of the latent racism that prevents people from attributing the least merit, the last virtue, to colored or black people.
'The Duvalier revolution, which has constantly been carried on by the people and by its leader, became anchored during the first decade on indestructible administrative and socio-political bases, and the great leader of the nation, in profound concord with the popular conscience, decided to dedicate the second decade to the promotion of the Haitian economy in order to ensure that economic independence without which political independence is just a fantasy.
'In his welcoming speech to the members of the International Development Bank, when it visited Haiti from 20 to 24 July 1970, the lifetime President of the Republic declared:
' 'In your search for investment opportunities I recommend that you follow the main guidelines of the strategy for economic development of my Government, based on the climate and natural beauty of the country, its proximity to the large American centers and its abundant and cheap labor.'
'That strategy's aim is to create an infrastructure electric power, roads and agricultural programs which will serve as a basis for private enterprise in those fields favored by the above mentioned comparative advantages: tourism, processing and assembling industries for reexport, the export of fruits, vegetables and other products.
'Some of these projects, thanks to the vigor of the Head of State and the sacrifices gladly made by Haiti, have already begun to take root in the soil of our land. I quote with pleasure:
' 'Your revolution has given rise to every hope for the rural and urban masses and also for the middle classes deriving from these masses. The great awakening continues. The Haitian masses and middle classes are in process of psychological change. I have considered that fact pertaining to our revolution, and have continued to organize it. The great awakening continues, accompanied by a desire for development and a desire for change.'
'And, later in the same message:
' 'If, when peace is sought, it were to be found and strengthened and not jeopardized either by the deeds of men or acts of God, then I shall undertake with the Haitian people this tremendous new work of development, building the infrastructure of the Gonaives plain and its development.'
'Prophetic words, as it turned out. A military traitor, in his unbridled ambition for power, took to the sea on the morning of 24 April 1970 with three Haitian naval units, and from the road stead of Port auPrince bombarded the capital.
'In an ultimatum, he had already demanded that the Head of State put the reins of power into unqualified hands. What were the targets of this bombardment? The national palace, markets, public buildings and schools. There were a number of victims among the civilian population; houses were destroyed, and there were direct hits on the left wing of the national palace.
'The treacherous soldier was only a link in the chain of conspirators who, being outside, had tried to seize command posts simply in order to reestablish their caste privileges to the detriment of the interests of the real country.
'They had forgotten that true revolutions are irreversible and that it is impossible to turn back the course of history or to shake the faith of a people in its destiny.
'There was in the enemy camp none of those good souls, so easily moved to indignation, to condemn the criminal actions of rebels and mourn the civilians and schoolchildren who were victims. No commission of human rights asked them to account for their acts.
'The development and economic progress of the nation may have been thwarted but it has not been compromised. The results of the present financial year, from the financial and economic points of view, far exceed those of previous financial years and make it possible to enter with some optimism upon the battle of the future.
'In this year, which commemorates the twenty- fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, a year which has been darkened by so many international as well as national tragedies, should we not at this time ask humanity to scrutinize its
own conscience? Should it not be hoped that, by abandoning the road to death and moving towards progress, it will be able to increase love and reason according to the principles of the Charter and to revitalize the Organization by hearing a continuous dialog about the objectives of peace and progress; a dialog which would presuppose a better approach to these problems and would generate solutions safeguarding the progress of man as a whole and help to satisfy his material needs, to enrich his faculties,' and make available to him a continuous dialog replacing the unjust notion of cooperation imposed by that of an enlarged and liberated cooperation in order to preserve essential values, the originality of cultures and ways of life, and respect for the political structures appropriate to the various peoples; a necessary dialog for the evolution of societies which are only seeking for an improvement of physical and human resources by enriching the infrastructure and the quality of those persons who are called upon to use them?
' 'A citizen of the world, which is close to my heart, a man of the present, who participates in the destinies of all peoples, I have always proclaimed the strength and transcendental value of the noble principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which the first black republic of the world together with other nations which met at San Francisco, held up to the baptismal fonts of the cathedral of hope.
'Thus I hope that all Member States, thanks to the virtues of participation, understanding and concerted action, will help to bring about an era of universal solidarity and will reestablish for the United Nations the ever urgent task of bringing about a better future for men wherever they may be.
'Dr. Frangois Duvalier 'President for Life of Haiti'"
25,1970,MDG,"5.	 Our delegation has more than one reason to be pleased with the election of Mr. Hambro as President of the twenty--fifth session of the'General Assembly of the United Nations: first of all, because his people and mine for more than a hundred years have had the best of relations based on understanding, generosity and disinterested cooperation; and then because we have long known his human warmth as well as his qualities as a diplomat and a human being, and, finally, because his devotion to the goals of our Organization guarantees the success which this commemorative session so richly deserves.
6.	Our very special feelings of fraternal gratitude go to Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph, President of the last session, who so skilfully and gracefully conducted the work of that session, in frequently difficult circumstances.
7.	It is also fitting to pay a tribute to our esteemed Secretary-General, whose perseverance and exemplary equanimity equaled only by his desire to see the international community resolutely respect the principles and norms of our Charter.
8.	Only a few day ago, Madagascar celebrated the tenth anniversary of its admission to the United Nations under the sponsorship of France and Tunisia, two countries whose friendship and esteem are particularly dear to us. Ten years in the life of a nation is not much, and yet, on behalf of my Government, I can testify that these 10 years of contact with the United Nations have been rewarding indeed and have awakened in us an awareness of our responsibilities and obligations towards the international community.
9.	It is with this awareness of our responsibilities and obligations that 1 shall review briefly the outline of the policies which we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue in this Organization. For us, equality among States requires that there be strict respect for their sovereignty, thereby ruling out any intervention ism and a fortiori anything resembling political imperialism which might serve to encourage the unbridled cult of power. In our opinion, relations between nations should be based on defined and accepted principles freely agreed upon and on the idea of interdependence while protecting national interests and putting down any attempt at economic or ideological neocolonialism.
10.	We would hope that the right to a free existence compatible with dignity would be assured for all people in all communities. We prefer negotiations to violence. Instead of sterile and always dangerous and frequently uncontrollable confrontations, we would choose an objective and realist dialog, because our philosophy has taught us in Madagascar that we must always work for negotiated compromise without sacrificing our basic principles.
11.	Our policies are based on justice, order and objectivity, and we refuse to base ourselves on emotional choices, which may at times be generous but of doubtful effectiveness.
12.	Analyzing the international situation just before the commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization, the Secretary-General, in the introduction to his annual report [A 180011Add.1 and Corr.l], conveys to us his cautious optimism. This opinion, which is in sharp contrast with the feelings of frustration expressed in recent years, is one that we share, although all aspirations are far from having been satisfied. But this is not the time for recriminations or claims and as we approach this decade which we hope will be fertile in the fields of disarmament, decolonization and economic and social progress, we must analyze with complete objectivity the contribution which each of our States can make to help our Organization to play a foremost role in preparing a future which will be not ours but that of youth and generations to come.
13.	We have reason to be optimistic because, in spite of slowness, obstacles of all kinds and divergent interests, it really seems that we have emerged at last from the nightmare of the cold war and the unbridled armaments race, an early end to which did not seem to be in the offing. Little by little we can see the outline of a new order which could not exist if there were not concessions on all sides. The specter of total and universal war also seems to be receding into the distance, even if the aggressive aspects of certain ideologies justify some apprehension.
14.	But the human mind, whose nature it is to hope and believe as well as doubt, boggles at the thought that $200,000 million is still being devoted annually to military budgets, and apparently no initiative has been taken by those most concerned the super Powers to reduce expenditures in a reasonable but considerable way in the interests of social or economic expenditures. In the explanatory memorandum accompanying the request to place on the agenda the item entitled 'Economic and social consequences of the armaments race and its extremely harmful effects on world peace and security', we tind the following sentence:
'The Romanian Government believes that the economic and social consequences of the armaments race and the grave threat which it poses to international peace and security are questions which merit the attention of the General Assembly at its twenty- fifth session ' [A/7994, para.7].
My Government, which at the past two sessions requested that consideration be given to assigning part of the sums released by disarmament to the campaign against poverty, sickness and ignorance, cannot but fully support that opinion.
15.	The hopes which have been kindled after the reconciliation in Nigeria, the inauguration of the strategic arms limitation talks, the signing of the non aggression Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union,  the agreement arrived at by three interested parties on a ceasefire in the Middle East and the plan for the demilitarization of the seabed and the ocean floor  unfortunately cannot make us forget that our world still remains strifetorn and divided and that destiny seems to contrive to give and to hold back at the same time. On two continents  Africa and Asia war continues to wreak havoc, taking away from those who have the greatest need the little hope that they still hold for a free and independent existence. Legitimate aspirations, such as those of a people to regain their identity, regrettably are repressed by force and arbitrariness in the name of a morality and a logic that are very difficult for us to understand. It is regrettable indeed that, in this international society where everyone claims to be acting in good faith, interests are still represented by proxy.
16.	The maintenance of international peace and security as it has been often stressed is one of the fundamental go of our Organization. But in order that international peace and security may be maintained, they must first exist, and in the words of the Secretary-General, States must 'accept compromises and even assume what they believe to be risks to their vital interests'.
17.	That, we believe, is one of the contributions which Member States could make to our Organization to help put an end to all conflicts and crises by peaceful means within the spirit of the Charter, and specifically Chapter VL We might then be able to enter into the disarmament decade in a calmer and more confident spirit and in a more objective way because we must realize that as long as there exists in this world a feeling of insecurity it will be impossible to achieve anything but slow and uncertain progress towards disarmament.
18.	That is why Member States should endeavor not only to reduce existing conflicts and crises but prevent those that could at any time be caused by a lack of understanding, narrow nationalism or obstinacy in advocating far-fetched theories. It is certain that if each State were to act strictly in accordance with the Charter, the risk of conflicts and unnecessary confrontations would be greatly reduced. But in its twenty-five years of existence the Charter has often been disregarded and its principles frequently violated. We would hope that this is due to differing interpretations and concepts although it is difficult entirely to accept this argument.
19.	Indeed, we have all declared our support for the preamble of the Charter and Articles 1 and 2, and yet it took more than eight years for agreement to come about on the seven principles of international law concerning friendly relations and cooperation among States. I said 'for an agreement to come about', in spite cf the existence of the draft declaration [A 18018, para. 83] submitted by the Special Committee, because profound and appreciable differences of opinion continue to exist.
20.	Many conflicts could have been prevented if these principles, which are of equal importance and set forth in the Charter, had been wholly respected and put into effect. I am thinking particularly of the principle of renunciation of the threat or use of force; that of nonintervention in the national affairs of States; and also that of equal rights of peoples and their right to self determination.
21.	In this way a further contribution which Member States could make in the building of peace and the strengthening of the authority of the United Nations might be to carry out the solemn commitment which we are confident we shall all subscribe to in a few weeks and which is founded on this draft declaration, by positive acts which, by their very nature, may contribute to the progressive development and the codification of these principles.
22.	We certainly understand the reasons for a certain reluctance; we realize that it is necessary that there
5 Special Committee on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States.
be juridical stringency. But in order to act in a manner consistent with our profound convictions and our declarations of intent, and the spirit of the Charter, might it not be appropriate here and now that all States, great and small, renounce provocations, subversion and war; that we respect the sovereignty of Member States and their free choice of political, economic and social systems; that, in the interest of peace and just cooperation among States, as well as that of understanding among peoples, wrongful practices such as apartheid, which we combat with equal firmness and determination, be abandoned; that there be respect for the integrity and dignity of all human beings, of all communities and all ethnic groups in order to arrive at a true international Charter of human rights; that those who are concerned agree 'that forcing people to submit to subjugation, domination or foreign exploitation or any form of colonialism constitutes a violation of the principle of the equal rights of peoples and their right to independence and consequently a denial of fundamental human rights and international law'.
23.	I have intentionally placed in the same context disarmament, friendly relations, the rights of peoples and human rights which have in common the fact that an appeal must be made to collective responsibility to solve the problems which they pose first for our conscience and then for our political wisdom. Another equally important point to which I referred when speaking of disarmament is that of development.
24.	I do not believe that it is necessary to go back to the Algiers Charter  prepared by the third world, then moved by illusions and hopes, nor to revert to the frustrations of the second session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,  nor to insist unduly on the difficulties which we encountered in order to secure support for the principle of a declaration on a global strategy for development.
25.	We must, however, recognize that economic and social progress is a common responsibility shared by the international community as a whole. In other words, the developing countries must first realize that they must count on themselves first and foremost and on a better use of their material and human  resources, whereas the developed countries, because of their privileged position, should adopt economic, commercial and financial policies that would be more favorable to the underdeveloped countries. If we succeed in this undertaking, the coming decade may herald a more just and rational economic order.
26.	We must realize, albeit reluctantly and regardless of the reasons put forward by those who do not wish to support the objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade, that the third world is determined to win the race towards development. That is perhaps a naive but no less fervent expression by us of a concerted and coherent determination that nothing will be able to change. We remain aware that the way ahead will be long and difficult, that many interdependent forces affect development and that the relationships between these forces and their degree vary from country to country to such an extent that our cohesiveness may be placed in jeopardy.
27.	We hope that in a spirit of association and participation the industrialized countries will support and encourage this irreversible determination on the part of the third world because after all we are not calling for an automatic redistribution of the resources of the world. Paraphrasing the theme of the Economic Commission for Africa for the next decade, we hope that, on the contrary, in this interdependent world we shall be encouraged to have more confidence in ourselves.
28.	Interdependence, self-confidence, commitment, political determination and collective responsibility are all familiar concepts which will once again come up for discussion whenever we deal with decolonization, human rights, development or disarmament. My delegation is convinced that the United Nations has an essential and primary role to play to make those concepts a reality and to act in such a way that they will not be drowned in rhetoric.
29.	For the United Nations to assume its responsibilities, we must set aside overly narrow concepts of nationalism and agree that it is a matter of urgency that the authority of the Organization be strengthened. It is in this way and in this way alone that we will stand a good chance of establishing an international community existing in an orderly fashion, and a new order based on peace, justice, progress and wellbeing.
30.	Peace, justice, freedom and progress are all themes of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations and of the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. In this year when there are two anniversaries, let us be courageous enough to recognize the fact that we have missed a number of opportunities; let us be sincere and ask how frequently we have forgotten or pretended that we have forgotten the principles of international charity in the original sense of the word. But let us realize at the same time that the Charter is our best hope and our best guarantee, and that our Organization, in spite of its ups and downs, has not always failed to meet our expectations.
31.	We are living in a constantly changing world, where priorities change even if values remain the same. To say that our Charter and our Organization have fully met the needs of the present would be to disregard the profound changes which have taken place ever since the end of the Second World War. We, for our part, will constantly reaffirm our devotion to the principles which were set forth in familiar historical circumstances and we shall advocate a new framework in which a new approach can be taken to relations between countries and peoples.
32.	For twenty-five years we have endeavored to safeguard our institutions and to protect them from our own contradictions and weaknesses. Now that we have been successful, it is time, we believe, to take the initiative and demonstrate imagination so that no one can say that we have abdicated responsibility in the face of the challenges of our times or that we have been unabk in the interests of the common good, to transcend our differences, to put down our selfish interests and to reaffirm with increasing conviction and vigor the belief of the founders of our Organization in a more civilized, freer, more just and more united world.




"
25,1970,CUB,"1.	  Mr. President, I should first like to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly and to assure you of our complete cooperation in the discharge of your functions.
2.	This Assembly meets a quarter of a century after the Charter was signed and the United Nations created. This occasion prompts us to take stock of the results achieved, to assess the effectiveness and utility of the Organization and to analyze the means and action required to help it achieve the aspirations and ideals for which it was created.
3.	This Organization was created to promote a new international order based on respect for the equal rights of all States large and small, and on the age-old determination of the peoples of the world to live in peace, to establish international cooperation and to develop. Those desires remain valid 25 years later.
4.	The fight against imperialist aggression, the fight to do away completely with colonialism and neocolonialism, to ensure that all the peoples of the world may enjoy their sacred right to self-determination and independence, to create conditions in which backward nations can develop economically and socially and overcome the barriers between them and the achievements of science and technology these continue to be the most important tasks before us, and they have prompted most of mankind to join together in a common front.
5.	However, as a result of factors that have nothing to do with the Charter, and which may be summed
up as the failure of certain imperialist Powers, and particularly the United States, to comply with its purposes and principles, the United Nations has been unable fully to carry out its lofty mission of guaranteeing international peace and security.
6.	An item that has remained on our agenda since the last session as a result of an initiative of the delegation of the Soviet Union the strengthening of international security has unquestionably helped to bring that preoccupation into focus. Cuba shares the concern expressed by that delegation and by other socialist countries in the draft declaration that has in this connexion been submitted to the First Committee for consideration [AIC.I.IL.513].
7.	Cuba has unswervingly maintained that peace is an indivisible and universal value and can be guaranteed only when it is enjoyed by everyone without exception. So it is that the successful efforts to bring about peace in today's world depend both on the fight against imperialist aggression and on militant solidarity with any people facing imperialist aggression, weapons in hand. Stopping the aggressor and cutting off its claws wherever he may be trying to use them is the best way of guaranteeing the security of those who may fall victim tomorrow.
8.	The peoples of Indo-China, the Middle East and Africa are therefore in the vanguard of efforts to achieve peace and universal security.
9.	The situation in Indo-China seems about to be resolved. American imperialism, after a long and cruel war in which almost all the resources of its criminal arsenal have been used, not only has been unsuccessful in taking away the freedom and independence of the people of VietNam but also has suffered at their hands, one of the greatest military and political defeats in its history. Its infamous cause in VietNam having been irretrievably lost, the only way out now for the United States is immediately, completely and unconditionally to withdraw its troops, equipment and military personnel and its allies and lackeys must do the same. It has no other alternative unless it wishes to continue to accumulate defeats on the battlefield and dishonor and repudiation throughout the world.
10.	Cuba once again expresses complete solidarity with the people of VietNam and the Government of the Democratic Republic of VietNam, which has just commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its heroic and exemplary existence, with the Revolutionary Provisional Government of South VietNam and the popular armed forces for the liberation of South
VietNam, which in their just and courageous struggle have shown all oppressed peoples the way to complete emancipation. International solidarity with the cause of the VietNamese people has become ever stronger with the passing ^f each day. This bears witness to universal repudiation of the innumerable crimes by American imperialism and its overseers in Saigon. The Conference of NonAligned Countries held last month in Lusaka  was a clear indication of the sweeping movement of sympathy and solidarity with the VietNamese people. Participation by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South VietNam in the person of Foreign Minister Comrade Nguyen Thi Bin is a great stride forward in the movement of nonaligned countries who in this way have demonstrated their unswerving commitment to the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and colonialism. The ovation given by the participants to Mrs. Bin was the longest and loudest of the entire Conference. The resolution which was adopted on Indo-China is an unequivocal warning to American imperialism that the peoples of the third world are standing by the VietNamese and other people of Indo-China in their heroic struggle against aggression and in support of their full enjoyment of independence and self-determination, and they demand an immediate and unconditional end to American aggression.
11.	But this solidarity is not shared solely by those who have experienced the harsh realities of colonialism. In Western metropolitan countries and in particular in the United States itself people have been expressing their determined support for heroic Indo-China.
12.	The Provisional Revolutionary Government of South VietNam submitted to the Paris Conference on 17 September last an important proposal designed to resolve the VietNamese problem and to bring about progress in talks. The Government of the United States must put an end to its so-called policy of Viet Namization of the war and must formally declare that it will withdraw all its troops and all those of its allies before 30 June 1971. It is also proposed that a provisional coalition government be set up consisting of members of the present Provisional Revolutionary Government, members of the Saigon Administration who genuinely want peace, independence and neutrality, and persons of various political and religious persuasions including those who reside abroad for political reasons. Obviously such a government will not include the traitors Thieu, Ky and Khiem. This Government would pursue an independent foreign policy, one of friendship and respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia.
13.	The present American Administration with low profile demagoguery has promised peace while expanding the war. Imperialist aggression has extended to the kingdom of Cambodia in the plot against Prince Samdec Norodom Sihanouk and there is now greater use of Yankee and Saigon troops against Laos. An imperialist move is now afoot to use Asians against Asians or and this amounts to the same thing to organize the military riffraff of their lackeys to defend the interests of their imperialist masters against the patriotic forces of the people. This move met with failure in the past when imperialism undertook the so called 'special war'. Starting the whole thing once again today shows that the criminal strategy of the Pentagon has run out of ideas. The present course can lead only to an even greater defeat for imperialism. The Yankee slogan of 'Asians against Asians' is one which the people of the region will turn into 'Asia against American imperialism and their traitors and mercenaries'. The Conference of the peoples of Indo-China made an historic commitment and expressed its unanimous determination to fight until it has completely done away with American intervention.
14.	A particular cause for indignation is aggression against Cambodia. The neutral Cambodia of Prince Sihanouk defended its independence and sovereignty in exemplary fashion in difficult circumstances. Its conduct earned it the admiration of the whole world, particularly of the independent Asian and African nations. At the third conference of nonaligned countries the opinion of the third world on the situation in Cambodia was set forth with utmost clarity. After a lengthy debate in which 40 countries participated, 21 unequivocally stated that the only legitimate representative of Cambodia at the conference was the Royal Government of the National Union presided over by Prince Sihanouk. Only seven delegations defended the spurious representation of Lon Nol and 12 abstained. The figures could not be more eloquent. It is indeed scandalous that in this Assembly the lawful seat of the Government of Cambodia has been usurped by spokesmen of a puppet regime created by the Central Intelligence Agency, propped up by foreign bayonets and guilty of the crime of genocide against its own people. This Assembly must heed the call of the people of the third world, expressed at the Lusaka Conference, and must expel the Lon Nol clique and restore the rightful place of the legitimate government which together with its armed branch, the National United Front of Cambodia, has liberated a large part of the territory and represents the right of the people to an independent and peaceful life.
15.	In the Far East the tensions provoked by the aggressive policies of American imperialism against the Popular Democratic Republic of Korea continue. This problem has been considered by the General Assembly for many years. It is high time that it was resolved in the only way consistent with the principles of the Charter. The immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea must be called for and the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea must be dissolved. Once and for all an end must be put to United Nations interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people. The peaceful and independent unification of Korea is a matter for the Korean people alone. Using the United Nations as an instrument in the antiKorean policies of the Government in Washington is a gross violation of the principles of the Charter and seriously impairs the prestige of this Organization.
16.	The conflict created by imperialist aggression in the Middle East continues unresolved. Cuba reaffirms its support of the Arab peoples and once again calls for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all occupied territories in the United Arab Republic, Syria and Jordan. Once again we express our solidarity with the Palestinian people in their heroic struggle to exercise their legitimate rights.
17.	We express once again our feelings of grief over the death of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, the great leader of the Egyptian people and hero of the Arab nation. His passing is a particularly severe blow for it has occurred at a time when the imperialists are threatening fresh aggression against the Arab people while Nixon is engaged in sabre-rattling around the Mediterranean.
18.	Young African nations, working hard to bring about progress, justice and independence, must cope with the growing threats of the forces of colonialism and racism which, disregarding all the resolutions adopted by this Assembly and the Security Council, wish to keep Africa in slavery and serfdom. The Lusaka Conference once again demonstrated that there is unity among all nonaligned countries defending the rights of the African peoples. It called on this Organization to adopt effective measures to put an end to colonialism and racial oppression and it condemned the military support which South Africa has been receiving from Western Powers. My delegation will cooperate with whatever efforts are made here to support the just fight of the peoples of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau), Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa.
19.	The right to self-determination is a universal one; it is an inalienable prerogative the exercise of which must be guaranteed for all peoples in all regions of the world. Therefore, my delegation once again would denounce the inertia of this Organization regarding the case of Puerto Rico. Five years ago my country called for consideration of the subject in the Special Committee on decolonization. But the Special Committee has not yet been able to consider it due to the stubborn opposition of the United States the administering Power. Puerto Rico is, has been, and will always be a Latin American nation. American military occupation since 1898, and pressure which has been brought to bear by all the resources of its empire to absorb it in the metropolitan country, has not been able to undermine the desire for independence of that sister people. Cuba would call on those who are opposed to colonialism to express their solidarity with the heroic struggle of the Puerto Rican people for national independence.
20.	Now when many delegations are concerned with strengthening the effectiveness of the Organization the question of its universality acquires fresh importance. However, there still remains a problem which has been hampering our activities for more than 20 years the representation of China. Our position is very well known and I need now only confirm it. Cuba will once again request that the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China be restored in this Organization and that the usurper Chiang Kaishek clique be expelled.
21.	The work of our Organization would be more effective if more States which could make an important contribution to international relations could participate. That is true of the German Democratic Republic. Discrimination against that independent State is unjust and harmful to the international community for it deprives it of the cooperation of a peaceful country which has achieved a high degree of economic development.
22.	As we begin the Second United Nations Development Decade the problem of promoting economic and social progress in the countries of the third world has become more pressing. We shall be considering that item in detail when it is taken up in the appropriate Committee, but we should now like to state a few important considerations which on more than one occasion have already been put forward by representatives of Cuba. The general picture outlined in various United Nations documents suggests that the effects of underdevelopment have been only slightly lessened. It is necessary to emphasize that development demands as its primary requisite profound structural changes in countries which wish to develop. That in turn inevitably requires revolutionary changes in the structure of power and social relations before injustice and inequality can be eliminated. Without such changes it would be illusory to imagine that the people can be mobilized or that the masses can make the sacrifices needed to develop the country.
23.	In the circumstances, therefore, it is impossible to expect that the Second Development Decade will achieve more than the first unless there is a radical change in international trade relations and in the generally prevailing ideas about foreign financing and its conditions.
24.	Furthermore, Cuba has said that the projected growth rate corresponds not even remotely to the plight of the developing countries. An annual per capita growth rate of between 3.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent in those countries means that the average annual income of the inhabitants of the countries of the third world would be approximately equivalent to 10 per cent of the average income of people in the developed capitalist countries and 5 per cent of the per capita income of the citizens of the United States. Such a prospect is hardly satisfactory for millions of men and women who live in poverty and who are prepared to fight for a more dignified existence.
25.	A number of delegations have expressed their concern over the hijacking of civilian aircraft. Cuba's position was very clearly set forth in the statement made by the delegation of Cuba in the general debate last year [1705th meeting] and in Cuba's Act 1226 promulgated by the Revolutionary Government to deal with this new form of crime. Allow me to say once again that Cuba has suffered more than any other country from the effects of these criminal activities which were invented, organized and promoted by the imperialist Government of the United States and its lackeys on this continent in an attempt to place our revolution in jeopardy. Since 1959 dozens of planes and hundreds of ships have been taken from our country and directed to the United States using violence leading on many occasions to the death of crew members and innocent passengers. Many of those planes and ships never came back to our country. They were literally stolen by the imperialists or their henchmen, and the end result, because of the bounty taken, has been tantamount to an act of piracy. The people responsible were never punished and even appeared on television and in the United States Congress where the legislators today who are complaining about such acts held them up as heroes. No international body raised a voice in protest. This Organization did nothing in the face of the reiterated denunciations of our delegation. At the time it was felt that we were a small country with very few planes and ships. But today an attempt is being made to mobilize the international community, for the effects of these crimes are precisely turning against those who promoted them before in such an irresponsible and criminal way.
26.	But the facts are there, eloquent and unassailable. No country has seized so many ships and planes in acts of piracy as the United States. No other country has provided a reception, protection and encouragement for those responsible for these misdeeds as the United States has done.
27.	Cuba, for its part, has rigorously applied a policy of immediately allowing these ships and crews to continue to their destinations and we have never encouraged such activities. Our Government was the first to pass a law establishing sanctions for those responsible for hijacking ships or aircraft. Our position is set forth in that law. We have not modified it nor do we intend to do so.
28.	We reject any attempt at pressure or boycotting through multilateral agreements and we would repeat that we are prepared to discuss the question of bilateral agreements to' resolve this problem with those countries which are prepared to take exactly the same action that we have taken as regards the hijacking of ships and planes and as regards other violations of laws and norms which govern international traffic and this on a strictly reciprocal basis.
29.	In connexion with this problem and to dispel certain tendentious interpretations, I will read the statement made on 28 September last by the Foreign Minister of Cuba, Dr. Raul Roa:
'We hope that the Government of the United States will not try an American citizen, Robert J. Labadie, for this is a case of mental alienation which has been established both in the United States and in Cuba.
'Mr. Robert J. Labadie is in a psychiatric hospital in Cuba. The Government of the United States, through the Swiss embassy, in a note dated 27 August of this year, expressed its willingness to receive Mr. Labadie in view of the fact that he 'was under psychiatric treatment in the Valley Forge Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. The Government of Cuba agreed to return him for humanitarian reasons.
'The authorities of the United States concealed this circumstance from public opinion. To apply the penal law to this person who is mentally ill would be a dishonest and illegal act.
'Through mere publicity the problem of the hijacking of planes cannot be solved.
'If the Government of the United States seriously wishes to deal with this problem, the Government of Cuba is prepared to sign immediately an agreement on the basis established in Cuban Act 1226, promulgated on 16 September 1969, which includes, in addition to the hijacking of aircraft, the hijacking of ships and other violations of laws and norms governing international traffic.
'We also wish to say clearly and categorically that we will not accept or endorse any international agreement on the hijacking of aircraft unless it specifically includes all other forms of piracy and violations without any exceptions.'
30.	Of course, during the present debate an attempt was made to blame Cuba for these incidents. The self styled prosecutor has been a lawyer with the United Fruit Company and the Allied Chemical Company; he is at present a representative of the Aluminum Corporation of America, United States Steel and other United States companies, and in his leisure hours acts as the Foreign Minister of Costa Rica.
31.	Mr. Facio tried to divert the attention of this Assembly in his futile attempt to cover up aggressive plans against Cuba involving the Government that he personally represents. For a few months now, American imperialism has been hatching new aggressive plans against Cuba for which it is using the territories of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. This is a secret to no one. With the effrontery typical of pirates they even preach this to the four winds.
32.	Let us see what that gentleman said in Miami on 7 June last, according to the American press agency UPI:
'Gonzalo Facio, Foreign Minister of Costa Rica, suggested last night that the time had come 'to promote internal turmoil' in communist Cuba to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro. He said that 'a few immediate blows from the defenders of freedom' would precipitate the defeat of Castro's control on the island.'
He went on to say:
'First, Cuban military forces which are prepared to rebel must be guaranteed that they will be given the necessary means to do so.'
33.	On 5 August last, when receiving two counterrevolutionary ringleaders who were organizing mercenary forces to be used for aggression against Cuba, President Jose Figueres of Costa Rica said:
'We must undertake a crusade to do away with all these ills and perhaps even to reply to one blow with one hundred blows, including armed action against Cuba for only our Latin American offensive can reverse the roles and bring everything into play to restore and strengthen our democratic system in America.'
This is a direct quotation of Mr. Figueres' words which appeared in the newspaper La Nation of San Jose, Costa Rica, on 6 August 1970 and is taken from a report by the Associated Press, dated the same day.
34.	The stateless persons who have lost Cuban citizenship were so pleased with promises of aggression against Cuba that one of them said, according to the same newspaper: 'When we go back to Cuba on 5 August 1970, that is, the day of the interview with Mr. Figueres, this will be a day which will go down in history as the first day of the Cuban liberation.'
35.	A few days later Mr. Somoza, who is the present titular leader of the dynasty of Nicaragua and who on 26 July last exhorted other Nicaraguans to go and fight for the liberation of Cuba, received them in the same bellicose frame of mind.
36.	Our Government is familiar with the activities being carried out by mercenaries in the Caribbean and particularly in Florida, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Our people, united and strong as ever, are prepared to put down, with an iron fist, any aggressors that dare to tread Cuban soil with their dirty boots.
37.	It would be regrettable indeed if these 'crusades', paid for by the United Fruit Company, Allied Chemical, United States Steel or the Aluminum Corporation of America, were to forget the lessons of history. They should recall that almost 10 years ago, at the Bay of Pigs, our people put down the mercenary invasion organized, financed and directed by the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States Government.
38.	The Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba, Fidel Castro, issued a clear warning to the puppets planning aggression against Cuba, in his statement on 23 August last:
'Let none believe that they have the right to organize expeditions within their territory against our country, for we shall feel that we have the right, with the means available to us, to bring the war to the territory of the country that lends itself to such invasions against our country.'
He added:
'We do not feel obliged to show any respect for the lackey Governments that organize bases for aggression against Cuba.'
39.	That is a reply worthy of a people who achieved its independence and sovereignty at the price of much sacrifice and heroically faced the most powerful empire of the world. This is the position of a people prepared to defend its rights no matter what the circumstances, no matter how powerful the enemy. This is the unshakable policy of a people determined to live in peace but not fearing combat, one that will victoriously repel any act of aggression. This is the position of a people that will never return to being the prey of imperialists and will always raise high the banner of socialism in the heart of the Caribbean, at the very gates of the worst enemy of mankind. Fatherland or death. We shall prevail.




"
25,1970,URY,"37.	 On behalf of my country, may I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election as President of this Assembly, a choice that not only honors a citizen of the noble nation of Norway and guarantees equanimity in the guidance of our debates, but also is a well-deserved tribute to a statesman and distinguished jurist who has rendered such valuable services to the United Nations.
38.	I also feel that it is my duty to pay tribute to Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph, the distinguished representative of Liberia, who presided over the past session of the General Assembly with undoubted wisdom and maturity.
39.	The twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations is an excellent opportunity for this Assembly to pause and ponder and discuss the progress and direction of the Organization, and carefully to take stock of the problems which it has dealt With and resolved and, in particular, those problems which are still with us in the present and lie before us in the future, darkening the horizon of our civilization which, in spite of the amazing progress of technology, seems to be about to lose control over the human and social problems which it must deal with.
40.	The world today is obviously not what it was twenty-five years ago. The political events which led to the creation of the United Nations are no longer as relevant, and the health of this great Organization cannot today be considered satisfactory. The faith, optimism and enthusiasm of which the founders of the Charter were possessed has very largely yielded to skepticism, disappointment and fear of the future.
41.	We must begin this plenary session which brings to a close a quarter of a century of work with the profound conviction that looking backward is of no avail if this is not accompanied by a firm determination to face and resolve, within the spirit of the United Nations Charter, not only the serious disputes and conflicts which are of concern to us today, but also those more vast and transcendent problems of universal dimension which will be of concern to mankind in the three decades before the end of this century.
42.	In order to achieve this age-old goal in an atmosphere of peace and progress, it is not necessary to create new and complicated international structures, nor for the time being will substantive changes in the United Nations Charter be required. On the contrary, it is sufficient to implement its provisions in good faith and, in particular, its purposes and principles which forbid the use or the threat of the use of force, and require non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, sovereign equality, the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with justice and international law, assistance to the Organization and its Members to maintain international security, respect for self- determination of peoples, co-operation in the economic and social areas and the constant development and furtherance of human rights. These purposes and principles were agreed upon at an exceptional moment in history and they reflect a level of understanding and agreement among States which it would be difficult to match in the present circumstances. We have, then, the institutional framework required for nations to face and successfully resolve the problems which we must deal with in the coming decades.
43.	Among these problems priority should be given to the need to attenuate or lessen the growing economic inequality which exists among nations, to control and slow down the burdensome arms race, to protect and improve the human environment and intensify food production to meet the needs of population of our constantly growing world. These are all questions which require more intense international co-operation on a greater scale, so that social tensions can be reduced and so that we can live in a better and more just world, in which men of all nations in their own countries may find the necessary conditions to develop their personalities and achieve the happiness they deserve as human beings.
44.	It is only in this way that the United Nations can secure the support of the peoples of the world and especially the support of 'succeeding generations', as mentioned in the very first sentence of the Charter. We should not forget the fact that those born since 1945 make up more than half of the present population of the world.
45.	In disarmament problems, which play a prominent role on the agenda of the Assembly, there are unavoidable physical reasons why there are distinctions among nations. There are those nations which, like ours, have practically no armed forces on a worldwide scale and must therefore play the role of a non- protagonist which someone once compared to that of the chorus of ancient tragedies. In spite of this, Uruguay has supported and will continue to support all resolutions designed to bring about progressive and balanced disarmament, prohibiting the use of nuclear power for any warlike purposes.
46.	So it is that we have supported all initiatives to suspend nuclear tests and we have ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] and the Treaty of Tlatelolco.2 Uruguay, together with other Latin American countries, has introduced an item to the Assembly for consideration, to implement resolution 2456 B on the signature and ratification of Additional Protocol II of the Treaty banning nuclear weapons in Latin America.
47.	During this session the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colo-nial Countries and Peoples will be celebrated. One of the great achievements of the United Nations has been the role which it has played in combining the effort of the peoples of the world and the Governments of many countries, including several ex-colonial Powers, which is very much to their credit, in this process of decolonization, which is one of the irreversible signs of our times.
48.	Uruguay, even before the Declaration of 1960, when the membership of this Assembly was quite different from what it is today, adopted a very clear anti- colonialist position, for we felt that any colonialist ties or bonds were incompatible with the present system of the international community.
49.	My country was honored to be a member of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in its initial composition during the first seven years of its existence. We were determined to help make a reality the principle of the self-determination of peoples in the purest and most authentic sense.
50.	What remains to be done to put an end to colonial-ism throughout the world is one task before the United Nations which cannot be delayed. It is a task which all States must support most decisively.
51.	During this first stage of its existence the United Nations has adopted the Universal Declaration on Human Rights [resolution 2I7A (III)], the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Optional Protocol and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [resolution 2200A (XXI)], and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2I06A (XX)]. Uruguay has given priority attention and firm support to all those covenants.
52.	Consistent with our deep seated political philosophy, shared by all our people, our country has
always advocated broad and unrestricted recognition of human rights without any distinction as to religion, race or sex. And it does seem now that those principles, as principles, have peacefully been accepted by civilized nations.
53.	But that acceptance cannot be considered a goal. It is only a starting point towards a more arduous under-taking. We would be flouting humanitarian sentiments which are the heritage of mankind if we allowed those principles which have been adopted today not to be applied and respected. It seems quite clear now that we must, as we have proposed in the past, have effective means at the international level to protect the rights of human beings, and that this should be done primarily through judicial bodies to which individuals whose rights have been infringed upon may have easy access.
54.	It is only in this way that we can fully secure legal guarantees for human rights, which in the history of institutions seem to have been protected first by law, then by constitutions and finally by international convention. In this way their final protection will be entrusted to international bodies, which will act in accordance with objective, impartial and automatic protective machinery, which will not be of an ad hoc nature or dependent on the political expedient.
55.	One symptom of the deterioration of genuine international peace may be seen in conflicts which threaten to become chronic and which create fluid areas of strife filling mankind with fear, because we do not see the end of those conflicts and indeed we realize that they might expand.
56.	Recently the Middle East has been in the forefront of our attention. This is an area in which, in spite of the undeniable efforts of the United Nations and of Governments that have lent their co-operation, significant progress has not been made towards a just and lasting peace.
57.	For this reason we are pleased to point to the recent acceptance by States involved in that conflict of the plans presented by the United States of America, which seems to have had the beneficial effect of attenuating the dangerous spiral of violence which has been a characteristic sign of recent times.
58.	Acting from a feeling of solidarity with these peoples many of whose representatives live with us and are an important and conspicuous part of the population the Government of Uruguay invited its sister nations of Latin America to co-ordinate their views on this subject and to offer in the United Nations, if the opportunity presents itself, a contribution to the solution of the disputes in the Middle East.
59.	This initiative should not be interpreted as a new source of disturbance in the already turbulent area where so many forces are already at work on this problem. The sole purpose is to prevent possible dispersion of effort which would ensue if many Latin American countries, joined together by international traditions and peaceful and universal feelings, did not act together and co-operate in a way which they deemed most effective perhaps even by remaining cautiously silent in the face of this difficult problem which has disrupted areas so dear to our people and their traditions.
60.	One very prominent item on the agenda of this Assembly is the item on the sea-bed, the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, which is closely connected with moves that have been made to bring about a new conference on the law of the sea.
61.	In this field, as is well known, the Government of Uruguay, taking into account developments in the international practice of States relating to the law of the sea and the oceans, decreed on 3 December 1969 an executive order which extended its territorial sea for the purpose of guaranteeing the defense of its national interests, the well-being of the people and opportunities for development and progress. In taking this decision it was borne in mind that in recent years an increasing number of States, particularly in Latin America, have extended their sovereign rights, demonstrating in this way the absence of norms of positive international law that are capable of limiting the power of States to establish the extent of their maritime jurisdiction and their territorial sea.
62.	In May of this year our Foreign Ministry arranged a meeting of Latin American States which had already extended the authority of the government to zones adjacent to the coasts. The result of that meeting was the Declaration of Montevideo, signed on 8 May 1970, which embodied basic principles on the law of the sea, on which participant States agreed unanimously. Pur-suing this promising initiative, the States of Latin America, with two exceptions, sent their representatives to Lima to take part in another Latin American meeting on certain aspects of the law of the sea, which reiterated in very much the same terms the essential principles of the Declaration of Montevideo, and adopted other resolutions setting forth joint policy on the main problems of the law of the sea, particularly having in mind debates to be held in the sea-bed Committee and in this Assembly.
63.	Consistent with these principles, my Government, with regard to the convening of an international conference on the law of the sea, has as a matter of principle given a favorable reply, subject to the under-standing that we should like to see the items mentioned in resolution 2574 A (XXIV) of the General Assembly discussed at such a gathering. On the other hand, we regard as inappropriate the convening of one or more conferences with agendas limited to various partial aspects of the law of the sea.
64.	With regard to the extent of the continental shelf, my delegation is opposed to any reform of the definition of the continental shelf contained in the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf of 1958, which, as is well known, is Latin American in origin.
65.	In the enormous area of economic and social problems viewed on a world-wide scale, as this Assembly should view them, the star item remains under-
3 Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction.
development, and we are inclined to believe that it will continue to occupy the leading place in the scenario, as it were, of our concern.
66.	To be understood in its proper dimensions, the basic aspect of under-development must be complemented by the realization that under-development of the countries of the 'third world', and particularly the Latin American countries, contrary to earlier belief, can no longer be considered to be a mere stage in the life of peoples, comparable to certain short-comings which can be seen uniformly throughout the evolution of living organisms. Under-development is not a normal crisis of growth but rather a pathological disturbance within the economic and social evolution of human communities. Like any illness, it calls for adequate therapy. The responsibility of our generation is precisely to prove wise enough to determine what this treatment should be and to be strong enough to apply it. Contemporary man, more than man at any other time in history, feels that the world is not remaining static; it is necessarily changing, whether through evolution or revolution. Our difficult job is to place our faith and our hard work on the side of the balance where evolution lies, so that we shall not be caught off guard by the inevitable consequences of revolution.
67.	All this leads me to reiterate once again that the proposals for the Second United Nations Development Decade constitute one of the fundamental items of this Assembly.
68.	The Government of Uruguay has expressed in other forums of the United Nations, such as the Economic and Social Council, its resolute support for such proposals and also for the new strategy which they presuppose, emphasis being placed not exclusively on purely economic growth, that is, on increasing the gross national product, but on a more equitable distribution of income and on other social objectives such as the expansion of employment, the improvement of housing and opportunities for education in keeping with the needs of development.
69.	In particular my delegation welcomes the recommendation to intensify, through new agreements on primary products, international trade in those goods that have unstable markets. In our capacity as a producer and exporter of wool, my country regards as well justified the recommendation of the Committee for Development Planning in which 'special recognition should be given to the difficulties encountered by producers of natural goods which face competition from synthetic materials', advising in such cases the elimination of 'all tariff and non-tariff barriers against such imports, whether in primary or processed form'.4
70.	Beyond any doubt, the prime prerequisite to development is the determination of each country. My country in the past two years has made a tremendous and successful effort to hold back the scourge of inflation, which upsets and in fact makes impossible any real attempt at economic development. As Minister of Industry of my country at that time, I had occasion
to initiate in June 1968 a policy of stabilization, which has become consolidated recently, with a sharp decline in the cost-of-living index, which now indicates an annual rate equivalent to only 10 per cent of the rate that existed in 1967. The increase in international reserves, the increase in exports and the considerable growth in the gross product, which in that short period was doubled all these are favorable signs that show the favorable results that can be brought about by a sound policy properly backed up by the public authority.
71.	As far as trade with developed countries is concerned, I should like to make a brief reference to the meeting of the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination, which was convened in Buenos Aires at the ministerial level to co-ordinate economic, financial and technological relations among Latin American States with regard to contacts with the European economic communities.
72.	It is our hope that, as is occurring in the dialog now proceeding between Latin America and the United States in regard to trade matters, a constructive under-standing can be arrived at, which will permit the tightening of our traditional economic bonds with Western Europe, inspired as the Declaration of Buenos Aires says, by principles of justice, equity, international solidarity and mutual respect.
73.	Among the questions that are of concern to the world today there is one which has particular political and social implications : that relating to crimes against humanity. In Uruguay we have had occasion to deplore a crime of this type which cost the life of a citizen of a country that is traditionally a friend of ours, an innocent victim of an act which stirred the deepest feelings of our people. I should like to reiterate here most solemnly, and in doing so I express the sentiments of the Uruguayan people, the angriest repudiation of that crime and also of the other kidnappings of citizens of friendly countries, committed by small groups of conspirators who, setting themselves up as crusaders for a new and violent gospel, perpetrate crimes of the most ruthless and arbitrary sort.
74.	Attempts were made through kidnapping to force the liberation of detainees and condemned persons who are not political prisoners but simply the perpetrators of common crimes and are subject to ordinary justice, which acts quite apart from political power, and within which they have access to due legal process with all guarantees for their defense. In such circumstances any attempt at extortion or blackmail is quite inadmissible, even where the noble purpose of saving precious and innocent lives is concerned; for that would presuppose not only a violation of the Constitution and laws but would set a very grim precedent for man's future as a member of society. The suppression of crime, essential for any human group that has gone beyond the primitive stage of private vengeance, would ipso facto be prevented, because it would be impossible then to punish those who break the penal laws, even those laws which protect the most sacred rights of man : life and freedom.
75.	On the initiative of the President of our Republic, Mr. Pacheco Areco, a policy was established as was explained by our country in the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States which has been recognized and understood by many friendly Governments as the doctrine which really constitutes the best safeguard for diplomats, since it prevents the kind of blackmail that seems to be constantly increasing and involving new victims or encouraging the commission of other crimes against humanity.
76.	Our Government, always a zealous defender of the principle of non-intervention, would state, as an essential factor for the development of this whole item, its belief that these matters which through their external repercussions can affect bilateral relations in the international field are by their very nature a subject which properly falls within the competence of each State, that each State should assert the right to handle these matters as it understands them, in accordance with the circumstances of time and place, it being understood of course that at same time a uniform mode of conduct in this respect, freely agreed upon by the different countries, would be the best way of guarding against this kind of ruthlessness.
77.	Important international gatherings, with the affirmative vote of my country, have decided that this kind of offense cannot be regarded as being covered by the treatment which, as far as concerns extradition and asylum, is reserved for political offenses. The raison d'etre for this kind of treatment is the idea that the political offender is not a danger in a foreign country, but on the other hand in his country the courts at a given time might not prove able to offer adequate guarantees of impartiality. This reasoning does not apply to criminals who have recourse to such measures as the use of foreign diplomats as hostages and victims, which is an act of odious barbarity prohibited even by the laws of war. Methods such as these strike not just against a regime or a given political system, but against all forms of organized society, whether internal or international; and they truly constitute acts of lese-humanity, offenses which no longer are jure civitate but jure gentium.
78.	Acts such as these, as we have demonstrated, which try to break up the cohesion necessary for any organized social group, creating in the chosen sector the tense atmosphere caused by repeated acts of terrorism, which many times affect innocent civilians  such acts are not the sad privilege of just one country or one continent. Everywhere, on all sides, you see kidnappings, hijacking of aircraft, coercion on the nor-mal development of individual freedoms, on the exercise of public authority. All these acts are carried out with ambivalent purposes for the publicity thus gained or for the ransoming of accomplices who have been apprehended by the duly constituted authorities.
79.	In the light of this picture my Government feels that this Assembly could well devote its attention to an analysis of the idea behind the interesting initiative recently presented at the meeting of the Organization of American States in Washington, designed to provide special protection for affected property and persons, and this for the benefit of international relations and the progress of mankind as a whole.
80.	Our Government has co-sponsored the inclusion in the agenda of the Assembly of the item referring to the revision of the functioning of the International Court of Justice.
81.	By historical tradition and also through constitutional precepts, Uruguay is always prepared to accept the peaceful solution of any international controversy and is a resolute supporter of judicial and arbitration procedures. Fifty years ago, in 1921, Uruguay accepted without any reservation the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. This declaration, which still remains in force, is the longest-standing case of acceptance of the optional clause. We also ratified the Pact of Bogota  in the drafting of which the Uruguayan internationalist Dardo Regules took part. The essence of this instrument lies in the undertaking entered into by the American States to resolve their legal differences by having recourse to the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.
82.	Therefore my country cannot simply remain on the sidelines, seeing the difficult situation in which the Court finds itself now, having no business before it, especially when this comes precisely at about the time that the Court has finished its first fifty years of existence, Happily, this situation has been corrected with the important and happy precedent set by the Security Council in calling, for the first time, for an advisory opinion from the Court.
83.	Notwithstanding this, we also regard as a very timely and useful idea the study which we have pro-posed, and we will promote the need for a more general acceptance of the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.
84.	We must sincerely recognize that this Assembly would be rendered incapable of carrying out, the sacred functions which belong to it on a world-wide level if it did not succeed in perceiving with all clarity that the world as a whole wishes to shake itself free from its classic structures.
85.	It is only by remembering this truth, and some-times because it is so obvious we forget about it, that we can raise our eyes and our efforts and join this earth such a hapless and wretched earth to that remote infinite point towards which we are drawn all the time by that thirst for perfection that all men harbor within themselves and which draws them towards the perfection of created things.
"
25,1970,BOL,"135.	  I wish to congratulate the President on his well-deserved election. His personal qualities and the noble tradition of service to the fundamental values of mankind and peace which are the characteristic of the Norwegian Government give him ample claim to preside over this Assembly of the peoples of the world.
136.	I wish also to congratulate Mrs. Angie Brooks Randolph, who ably directed the work of the twenty- fourth session.
137.	To SecretaryGeneral U Thant I wish to convey again the coi dial greetings of my Government. His concern and exemplary dedication to the cause of the United Nations have earned our gratitude and satisfaction.
138.	Also I should like to pay a tribute to the founders of this Organization, which was established twenty-five years ago to strengthen unity and understanding among men. We express our gratitude and admiration to those who fought and died in two world wars defending the right of peoples to live free from oppression, fear and want; to the statesmen who drafted and signed the Charter of the United Nations; to the intellectuals, scientists, soldiers, workers and peasants who supported and made possible the existence of this forum; and to those who continue working, fighting and sacrificing their lives to ensure that peace, justice and progress for men and nations may become a fruitful reality in every comer of the earth.
139.	The Revolutionary Government of my country conveys to the Members of this Assembly, through me, this message of friendship which, in the first instance, constitutes an act of faith in the United Nations. In this connexion I may say that, like other nations, Bolivia believes in international peace and security; we believe in the principles of coexistence and cooperation; and we believe that the still undeveloped nations will obtain justice and progress through the exercise of self-determination and respect for the sovereign equality of States.
140.	We have faith in the intelligence, the creative capacity and the peaceful vocation of mankind; we restate our belief in the vast potential which joint actions by Governments can open up for the future. We affirm our belief in the future of the young nations, in their ability to unite effectively in the effort to transform international society, to overcome conditions of oppression, poverty and dependence which are characteristic of the present age and to decide on the emergence of a world in which mutual respect, harmony and interdependence will constitute the basis of international coexistence.
141.	The Government that I have the honor to represent assumed office on 26 September 1969. The twelve months that have elapsed have been marked by the application of a clear national leftist program which advocates economic transformation, social justice and liberation, in the revolutionary sense, as regards its internal actions. Bolivia has proclaimed an independent foreign policy which, above and beyond considerations of ideological confrontation between East and West, makes it possible to open the door wide to all countries members of the international community and permits the closest solidarity with the interests and aspirations of the peoples of the third world. Thus our foreign policy is the decisive complement of our national effort to overcome structures that shape the system of dependence and presupposes broad popular participation.
142.	Just as the rate of economic and social change is closely linked to the degree of effective pMrtiCiputlCli given to the people in the definition and application of development programs and the general policy of the country, the commitment and support of the people is an essential guarantee for national emancipation and for the fulfillment of the goals of our development strategy and of our foreign policy. In the light of the lessons of history, we see that the smaller States that do not have large armies and vast economic resources can rely for their security and progress only on the confidence and will for change that motivate their own peoples.
143.	Our international policy, therefore, expresses the position of the people of Bolivia, who are seeking the affirmation of their own personality. It is reflected in a frank, objective, friendly and constructive attitude; it does not conceal its positions, disguise its intentions or act by slogans or by preconceived notions; it looks at the realities and expresses its best will to participate in any initiative that will make it possible to ensure peaceful coexistence among the countries of the world. That is the approach that we hope will be reflected in a new diplomacy; it is the approach which the young generations expect of us.
144.	All the principles proclaimed by the United Nations Charter constitute the essence of the concept and practice of peaceful coexistence. It will be impossible for States to ensure harmony and coexistence unless they respect the territorial integrity of other States, unless they refrain from intervening in the internal affairs of their neighbors, ignoring the sovereign equality of all, overlooking the right to self determination or disregarding their duties in respect of cooperation and international solidarity.
145.	However, by definition coexistence fundamentally presupposes pluralism. Those who try to make the world uniform under a single religion, a single way of life, a common ideology or identical cultural values are mistaken. We proclaim the right of peoples to affirm their particular national characteristics and their own form of development, to utilize their natural resources, to trade and sail the high seas freely, to define their foreign policy and establish their institutions in accordance with their internal requirements. The only possible limitation is respect for the right of other States and for human freedoms. Coexistence inevitably is based on diversity; it should be' guaranteed and observed at the world and at the regional level, in the United Nations and in the Organization of American States, in Europe, Asia and Africa in other words, wherever more than one organized society exists.
146.	'Unity in diversity', which was the theme of the last meeting of nonaligned countries in Lusaka, sums up very succinctly the concept that I have set forth.
147.	Convinced as we are of the contribution that an effort at mutual understanding among peoples can mean towards achieving this spiritual disarmament that we long for, we entertain the most cordial diplomatic relations with the United States Government and with the Soviet Government. The traditional links which tie us to Latin America and numerous countries of Europe are now extended to the socialist world and to the new States emerging throughout the world. As part of this policy of opening the way to new horizons, we seek to win friends, to eliminate ideological barriers in international relations, to open channels for discussion and brotherly cooperation and to make possible new formulas of mutual cooperation.
148.	The friendly attitude that we have adopted towards all the States of the world asks in turn only a recognition of our own right to self-determination and compliance with the principle of nonintervention. The reasons are clear, inasmuch as the recognition of States and Governments, leaping over the barriers of the cold war, constitutes an un-renunciable sovereign right which we are not prepared to cede or to make conditional upon the will of third parties. It will be applied when we consider that it suits our own national interests.
149.	Like all other delegations here, we are concerned about the problems of world security. They are of special concern to us because of the peaceful tradition of Bolivia and because our country, like many others, has never attacked anyone. We can affirm with legitimate pride that not a single inch of Bolivian territory was won in an international war.
150.	Therefore, when the question arises as to which are the peace-loving nations, we can answer clearly that peace is endangered by those that stockpile arms, those that place imperialist and colonialist interests above the common advantage of the international community, those that flout the declarations and resolutions of the United Nations and its organs, those that exploit, invade and pillage other countries, those that refuse to recognize the right of others to freedom, equality and economic development.
151.	It has been said that it is illusory to think that world peace depends on the United Nations and that, on the contrary, the Organization depends on peace between the world Powers. We do not share that opinion and we admire everything that the United Nations has done to avoid war.
152.	However, we recognize the need to ensure through a process of democratization of international relations that the influence of smaller and medium States is really effective in the decisions affecting mankind. The developing countries cannot confine themselves to playing the role of instruments for preserving the interests of the superPowers. Bolivia is not nor does it desire to be an aligned country or a country that is a satellite of any of the superPowers.
153.	Probably the greatest risk to the United Nations now lies not in the danger that it might cease to exist, but rather that through its exclusion from political decisions, it would end by becoming converted into a technically useful but politically innocuous organization.
154.	The world will not accept a pax romana, understood to mean order imposed by the powerful. At this juncture of civilization the international community has sufficient means available to it to solve large and small conflicts. It is only necessary to adopt the effective measures that are spelled out in the Charter, to prevent and eliminate threats to the peace and to repress acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace. It is also necessary that States should take the decisions and assume responsibilities incumbent upon them. How much more reasonable the world would be if only the principles of the Charter were complied with.
155.	With respect to the future of the United Nations  and we are now celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary we should take timely care to ensure that this Organization does not meet the fate of the defunct League of Nations. In the case of the League, 'the triumphs went unnoticed while its failures were publicized in resounding terms'. We still have time to adapt this Organization to the needs of contemporary international life. Moreover, we should not forget the telling lessons of the past: just as the non-participation of the United States in the Covenant of the League of Nations constituted its fundamental weakness, so the absence of important States divests these deliberations of universality.
156.	In the face of a specific situation recognized by a large number of countries, we must apply the rule of universality. Otherwise the United Nations will end by converting itself into a limited association. As we understand this principle, we cannot support an exclusive position which would claim to set aside any State whose existence is an unquestioned reality. This argument is valid in all cases. Accordingly, the President of my country, General Alfredo Ovando Candia, recently stated in respect of one of these States in clear and categorical terms that within the framework of his international policy, Bolivia would like to see represented in this Organization both the Republic of China, a country with which we maintain traditional diplomatic relations, and the People's Republic of China.
157.	We are well aware of the difficulties inherent in this position, but we are more concerned about the consequences that may flow from the fact that a large proportion of the world's population is absent from the United Nations and does not share the obligations of the Charter.
158.	On previous occasions we have stated that our delegation vehemently condemns the survival of colonial regimes and the emergence of a system of neocolonialism problems which are worsened by the maintenance of situations of racial discrimination and the flouting of human dignity. Unfortunately, it would appear that the declarations and resolutions adopted to overcome these situations prove ineffective in the face of the lack of understanding of Governments determined to retard the course of history and persist in an attitude of continuing violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter. However, we are encouraged to learn that the developing awareness of mankind of such serious problems and the desire of the colonial peoples to emancipate themselves will in the long run, finally, overcome this deplorable situation. In this same connexion the struggle of the African peoples has been exemplary and commands general admiration.
159.	The evils that colonialism afflicts on countries are serious indeed. Not only does it destroy their population and their economy, but in addition it distorts the historical process of countries in such a way that even after the lapse of many' years, the damages inflicted are difficult to repair. The conflict in the Middle East is one of the worst legacies of a similar past. Accordingly, we are sure that the problems that we solve in our time are the evils that we will be sparing future generations.
160.	Bolivia has always refused to recognize the legality of territorial conquests achieved by force. We have not changed this position of principle. Neither have we changed the criterion that we adduced in 1947 when we supported the creation of a new State in the Middle East. If conquest and victory do not justify or consolidate rights, much less can they justify situations of injustice for tLe original population of a territory. All peoples, large and small, should have an equal opportunity to organize their societies and live in peace with their neighbors. Accordingly, any steps originating in the United Nations, or any action of Governments of goodwill, which are designed to find an adequate solution, will receive our support and certainly that of the majority of the international community. We express the hope that the final outcome of these events will bring peace to this region in turmoil.
161.	The questions that the great Powers left unsolved at the end of the Second World War the sequel of the cold war and the division of the world into areas of influence are also difficult.
162.	However, in the midst of uncertainty, we are pleased to note as a positive step the Treaty recently signed between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union. Humanity will receive with relief the announcement of similar agreements between Eastern and Western States which, although having different political and social systems, are trying to live together in peace through dialog and recognition of indisputable realities.
163.	The anguish and the worries confronting the world continue. The events which have been occurring for the past years in SouthEast Asia constitute another dramatic and disquieting issue. A people which, like every other people, aspires to live in peace is suffering the consequences of the universal confrontation of our age. Although total war has so far been averted, armed conflicts localized in various regions clearly endanger world security and call into question the ability of the international Organization and the great Powers to ensure peaceful coexistence. Unquestionably, one of the reasons for the dissatisfaction and the revolt of the younger generations throughout the world stems from the fact that it is impossible to explain events such as those which are occurring daily in VietNam. The repeated demonstration of the useless waste of life and material resources cannot fail to cause demoralization, impotence and frustration, not to say desperate reactions, that would seem to find their justification in these facts. To put an end to such a serious problem, as part of the contest of confrontation, the parties most directly concerned must devote their greatest efforts to the task of reconstruction and development in these regions which, instead of being the testing grounds for war, should be the arenas of constructive and helpful competition.The point of departure in such an undertaking would, of necessity, have to be the recognition of the right of these people to self-determination. Otherwise we would see fulfilled the old proclamation of the prophet Isaiah, who asserted 'the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly'.
164.	I do not believe that the failure to consider or even to refer to the delicate problems of the international community contributes to the finding of adequate solutions to those problems. Nor will the mere passage of time help to solve these problems. We are fully aware that these are burning and difficult issues and that, accordingly, they generate contrary reactions. We are convinced, however, that in presenting our own positions in a fair and honest manner we will facilitate a better understanding among States. How much suffering could we have spared mankind if we had applied this simple idea. Moreover, a duty of friendship and solidarity that my Government has towards the other Members of this Organization compels me to be consistent with this principle. Public opinion in Bolivia knows that my words accurately reflect its convictions and feelings.
165.	The fact of pinpointing questions that are awaiting solution can never be interpreted as a denial of the important progress and victories achieved by our Organization for the common good. The United Nations has contributed significantly to the development of international law, to the rendering of invaluable services designed to combat disease and hunger and to promote culture and education, to bring about a better understanding of social problems, to ensure specialized administrative cooperation, to render technical assistance and to confront the complicated problems of international trade and development. But, above all, the United Nations has avoided total war for a quarter of a century. We feel a sense of satisfaction for such contributions and we express our gratitude to and recognition of the help of the States, the institutions and the men who have made this possible.
166.	One of the most important records that the United Nations will leave for posterity is the invaluable legal structure set up to deal with a wide variety of concepts. Starting with the Charter of the United Nations, the treaties and other agreements worked out within the framework of the Organization lay down rules governing ever-wider aspects of international relations. My Government has approved many of those conventions, and in the next few days I shall have the pleasure of depositing personally new instruments of ratification.
167.	Among the questions that the Assembly will take up this year, we are particularly interested in the question of reserving the seabed and the ocean floor, and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction exclusively for peaceful purposes. It is already universally recognized that those resources are the common heritage of mankind and that they constitute a valuable resource which must be preserved and exploited rationally for the common good. The practices of depletion and waste which darken the history of the exploitation of natural resources in general should not be repeated in the rich regions of the seabed.
168.	In defining the legal scope of this question, it is essential to guarantee both this general interest as well as the legitimate rights of the riparian States. In the same fashion it would be impossible to ignore the special position of those countries which, for one reason or another, have no coastline of their own and which make up one quarter of the Members of this Organization, approximately one half of them being developing countries. A special meeting of the landlocked countries to examine those matters would help to find adequate forms of solution.
169.	Bolivia is prepared to continue rendering its fullest cooperation to the perfecting of the basic principles which will prevail in this field. In addition, we should like to offer our support to the concepts supported by the majority of the developing countries. To do so, we ask only that future exploitation and utilization of the resources of the seabed and the ocean floor should substantially alleviate the restriction imposed upon a country which cannot count on the benefits deriving from an independent coastal area of its own. This will also require the perfecting of a system of free access to the sea, including the possibility of building the necessary means of communication by agreement with the riparian countries, in order to make this right effective and to enable those countries to participate in the preferential development of the area in quantitative and qualitative terms as is the rightful due of those countries that are placed in an inferior position because they have no coastline of their own. When this item is taken up in the First Committee, my delegation will speak again on the point in greater detail.
170.	On many occasions in the past we have said that the Bolivian aspiration to have sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean is unwavering and independent of the foregoing proposals. In restating this position, the President of Bolivia, General Alfredo Ovando Candia, further stated that he is prepared to engage in a frank conversation which would lead to an honorable and constructive understanding with the Republic of Chile, considering the reciprocal interests of both countries, that would make possible the solution of the old problem which divides us and so pave the way for a new stage of friendship and cooperation. An agreement along those lines would prove the best step forward in the cause of Latin American unity, a magnificent contribution to coexistence and an example of international understanding.
171.	The third world, which is the world of the poor countries, is going through the adventure of independence and freedom. But, paradoxically, at times and in circumstances in which foreign contribution to the development of those countries should be more effective, it is discouraging to note that the first Development Decade has not satisfied either the aims or the expectations of the peoples. By comparison we can affirm that the past decade represents to the world what at the regional level the alliance for progress has meant to Latin America.
172.	It would be naive to claim that any country should sacrifice its national interests on the altar of international cooperation. It is certainly by no means a question of demanding anything that is not in the common interest. We only hope that people will understand that poverty in two thirds of the world is of concern above all to the prosperous countries, which .should realize that their comfortable existence cannot be permanent in a world beset by dissatisfaction.
173.	Obviously, the developed countries have encountered particularly acute difficulties in the period that is just coming to a close. None the less, history
and economic science show that societies will never be completely free of problems. If compliance with the duties of solidarity had to be delayed pending the advent of exceedingly favorable and lasting economic cycles in the developed countries, no cooperation would ever actually come about. Just as the European reconstruction program was carried out under the most adverse conditions for victor and vanquished in the Second World War and yet achieved complete success, so we can assure the Assembly that the tensions of the present world do not allow us to wait until there has been a total and perfect adjustment of the domestic situation of the countries which are duty bound to cooperate in this task. The complicated internal situations that face them are, in many cases, closely linked to the serious deterioration of the world's economy and will find simultaneous solutions only within the framework of a global strategy.
174.	Probably an inadequate understanding of the meaning and scope of the concept of international cooperation has helped to cause the past decade to fail. For some time cooperation has ceased to be an expression of charity or philanthropy. Apart from the aspects that are linked to debts of justice and reparations for the distortions originating from colonialism and the defective structure of world trade, international assistance is, in the terms of the Charter, in the nature of an inescapable legal obligation. It also constitutes an inherent right of the developing countries. And, lastly, it is a necessity in a life of international relationships and a basic prerequisite for safeguarding the necessary interdependence which world peace requires. In preparing the strategy for the Second Development Decade, the United Nations will have to think about the general theoretical framework and clearly lay down the reciprocal rights and duties, the commitments that will be assumed, the timetable to be followed, and will have categorically to affirm the will to change the painful present realities by a systematic long range effort.
175.	A special analysis should be made of the situation of the lesser developed countries in the whole group of developing countries. They are the opposite pole of the opulent consumer societies that accumulate the wealth of the world. There, the principal social tensions are concentrated and, therefore, there lie the greatest potential threats to peace and security. In these regions, more than anywhere else, we find lacking the postulates of justice and progress which constitute the motto of this anniversary year.
176.	The granting of largescale credits on terms in inverse proportion to the degree of development would help to bring about their capitalization. The immediate opening of markets for their exports would relieve the throttling of their foreign trade. Energetic action designed to correct social and geographic inequities would step up their progress.
177.	Many of the fundamental ideas on economic relations have repeatedly been set forth. They can be found in the agreements and resolutions of the United Nations Trade and Development Conferences. The Group of
Seventy-Seven summed up its aspirations in the Algiers Charter, and Latin America did the same in the consensus of Vina del Mar.9 Now, the important thing is to admit that this does not involve a group of isolated and fortuitous measures, but, rather, a coherent, long range program, destined substantially to change the forms of cooperation and trade.
178.	It is no longer possible to accept the contradiction inherent in the transfer of limited financial resources on the one hand, with on the other hand the impatient, not to say overhasty, recovery of capital and dividends, which have not had the necessary time to achieve their initial development goals.
179.	Certainly, private foreign investment does not represent a generous contribution. It is useful when it promotes industrialization and when it is adapted to local development plans. But we should not forget that, primarily, we are talking about a business which, like all others, must cope with the contingencies inherent in businesses of its kind, without hoping for privileged treatment that would nullify the interest to be derived by the recipient country. The ideal social and political climate, which has so often been called for, can never be provided in societies that are afflicted by necessity.
180.	Moreover, the process of recovery of natural resources in the strategic sectors of the economy is not only irreversible but, in addition, it forms a part, as has been said on some occasion, of the recognized rules of the game. Obviously, the format will be different, depending on circumstances.
181.	It has been stressed that the ties on foreign loans should be eliminated to make it possible to use these monies in accordance wi*h the best choices open. Some progress has been made but it is necessary to go even further. Other ties of apolitical nature still persist and in this case, as in previous cases, I am not referring only to the United States of America which indirectly confine the area of decision open to the countries receiving this assistance. It is to a certain extent understandable that the policy of cooperation should be linked to national objectives of the countries providing the cooperation. But such ties are sometimes so rigid that they prevent countries from taking advantage of other equally interesting, financial, technological and commercial opportunities.
182.	Lastly, it is high time to provide a solution to the long-studied question of stable remunerative prices for basic resources.
183.	There can be true cooperation only in the exercise of an authentic independent foreign policy, for otherwise cooperation would prove to be the result of a situation stemming from subordination, servitude or dependence.
14.	And as an expression of the height of absurdity, the old technology of the Egyptian plough, of vehicles drawn by animals, the sailing vessels and the watermill, continues to be the basis of the economy of three quarters of the earth. And not because these peoples are devoid of talent, but, rather, because they were deprived of access to modern life. Here we find a new and fertile field for the United Nations: to awaken the dormant energy of peoples and launch them upon the adventure of thought, science and self-transformation.
185.	In the effort to promote progress, cooperation among the developing countries will play a primary role. The expansion of markets, the broadening of cultural horizons, better opportunities for technological research, and, finally, the exchange of people, ideas and goods, will promote solidarity and strengthen economies. In this connexion we have vigorously supported the process of Latin American integration at the regional and subregional level, and we trust that these efforts will meet with success.
186.	All that has iust been said does not, of course, mean we fail to recognize that the primary responsibility for development devolves upon the parties directly concerned and, above all, on their leaders, which in any event presupposes that the necessary changes will be introduced to ensure social mobility and a better distribution of income. It is not a question of transferring our own obligations to a third party, but, rather, of creating a common undertaking of general interest for the benefit of all mankind.
187.	Recalling past errors and events of the relatively recent past, in which the will of the stronger knew no limitations and was subject to no rules of any kind, we can realize that time has not passed in vain for the United Nations. It is true that the present imperfections are many and that the path ahead is very long indeed. However, a universal awareness of common values has matured, which undoubtedly will off set and moderate the excesses of power politics. This may well be the most important task achieved by this Organization. Because of this mission fulfilled, we joy fully welcome the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary.
188.	The achievement of the commitments of today is projected into the future. Therefore, it will be up to the coming generations to assume with serenity the resultant responsibilities and to build a society where peace, justice and progress will become an obvious reality.
189.	Youthful expressions of dissatisfaction and protest, which are the reflection of a dehumanized world, will acquire a constructive and creative physiognomy at the dawn of the new history to which we aspire for all peoples: a true and completely human history.
"
25,1970,IND,"40.	 Mr. President, I offer you our congratulations on your election as the President of the current session of the General Assembly. You represent Norway, a country which can take pride in its reputation as peaceful, just and progressive. Your personal qualifications and your family's dedication to international effort are well known. I should also like to express our appreciation of the services of your distinguished predecessor, Mrs. Angie Brooks Randolph. I would also repeat our admiration for U Thant, whose skill and dedication have won him our respect.
41.	Today is Mahatma Gandhi's one-hundred-first birthday, and we in India will take a fresh pledge to dedicate ourselves once again to the ideals for which the Mahatma lived and died, peace and nonviolence being the foremost among them. We may not fully succeed in living up to his ideals but we must continue to try.
42.	There are many developments in India which give us satisfaction. Our people are expecting a better life through our development plans. We have had a sizable increase in agricultural and industrial production. Our trade is also showing signs of improvement. India has once again demonstrated its faith in full-fledged democracy. Alongside this there is a growing desire of the common man to share more equitably in the distribution of national wealth.
43.	twenty-two days ago a great conference ended at Lusaka, and in 22 days from now we shall be celebrating the signing of the Charter of the United Nations. The Conference of Lusaka owes much of its success to the efforts and organization undertaken by the Government and people of Zambia, and once again we should like to thank them. The final declarations and resolution s of that Conference are being circulated as United Nations documents. They represent the consensus of 53 Members of the United Nations, representing about half the human race. I would urge that everyone read them.
44.	The Conference at Lusaka highlighted several key points. These are: international peace and security, peaceful coexistence and friendly relations, solution of international problems by negotiations, the value of the United Nations as a universal forum, decolonization, development, disarmament and the pursuit of the principles of nonalignment. In order to fulfill the objectives we subscribed to at Lusaka, we seek the widest support and cooperation of the Members of the United Nations.
45.	In assessing the achievements of the United Nations over the past 25 years, the major factor that strikes us is that, while another world war has been avoided, insecurity still prevails and that, while tension between the great Powers has eased and negotiations between them in certain fields have begun developments which are welcome armed conflicts are still raging in many parts of the world. This situation requires attention from the world community. A positive step in that direction that has been taken is the adoption by the Sixth Committee last week [1184th meeting] of the Declaration on Principles of international law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [A 18082, para. 8]. A further step to strengthen the edifice of peace that this Assembly could take is to adopt a declaration on the strengthening of international peace and security.
46.	Such a declaration should particularly include prohibition of the threat or use of force to settle international differences, scrupulous respect for existing international frontiers, inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by military conquest, settlement of disputes exclusively by peaceful means, regional cooperation, reduction of the gap between the developing and the developed countries, disarmament, and the right of self-determination for people under racist and colonial regimes.
47.	The developing countries particularly face innumerable threats to their independence and identity. They also face impediments in their economic development. Pressures continue from countries better organized, better developed and better equipped militarily. This has come to be known as neocolonialism and one of our efforts in the coming years should be to arrest these trends. In this context may I draw your attention to what our Prime Minister said at Lusaka about intellectual and cultural emancipation. She said:
'Those who dominated the world's political affairs and manned its economic controls also imposed a monopoly of ideas. For years we accepted their values, their image of the world and, strangely enough, even of ourselves. Whether we liked it or not, we have been pushed into postures of imitation. We have now to break away from borrowed models of development and evolve models of the worthwhile life, which is more relevant to our conditions not necessarily as a group but as individual countries with distinctive personalities.'
48.	There has been a great deal of success in the United Nations program for bringing new territories and new countries to independence, but much remains to be done. Portuguese colonialism in Africa, South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia, defiance by the racist regime in Rhodesia and the continued colonial status of a large number of territories and areas remind us of how much more needs to be done.
49.	South Africa denies the fundamental rights to the majority of its citizens and its policy of apartheid poses a threat to the peace. The alliance which has emerged there between the forces of colonialism and racism in an effort to preserve 'white supremacy' is an affront. We deplore the attitudes and actions of certain countries which encourage the regimes in Salisbury, Pretoria and in the Portuguese possessions.
50.	We are concerned at the declared intention of the Government of the United Kingdom to resume the sale of arms to South Africa. Any accretion to the military strength of South Africa will increase the threat not only to the neighboring countries in Africa, but also to the Indian Ocean area. We should like this area to be a zone of peace free from great Power rivalry.
51.	Much has been said about the United Nations peacemaking and peacekeeping operations. We believe that in the changing and evolving political scene of the world, the United Nations should occupy a central place. The expectation of the Charter that in the field of peace and security the great Powers would work in concert has not, unfortunately, materialized,. We hope that in the coming years this cooperation will be forthcoming for the benefit of all.
52.	We believe that in order to bring about a better atmosphere and eliminate many difficulties which persist it will be necessary to give all Members in the United Nations a feeling of participation in all decisions that may be made. Whether it be the issues of war and peace, economic development or independence and sovereignty, all Member States should participate in decision making. We welcome the cooperation among the great Powers, but are anxious that whatever decisions they may arrive at should be subject to discussion among all of us and that no decision should be implemented until it has received significant support, or consensus, if you like, of the United Nations as a whole.
53.	We regret that the universality of membership of the United Nations has not been achieved. In particular, there is a general realization that without the rightful participation of the People's Republic of China this Organization will continue to face difficulties in solving several basic problems.
54.	It is a matter of concern that the United Nations and the SecretaryGeneral have been handicapped for lack of adequate funds. We would, therefore, urge that all Members should cooperate in ensuring that the important problems in various fields undertaken by the United Nations do not suffer for paucity of funds. The Indian delegation will do whatever it can to strengthen the hands of the SecretaryGeneral in this respect. Equally, we are concerned about our procedures and methods of work. We would support any steps which may be suggested to bring about improvements in these matters. We attach great importance to suitable geographical distribution, not merely for the Organization as a whole, but in all its departments and at all levels.
55.	We consider that the Charter, if faithfully implemented, would overcome many difficulties which the Organization faces. Mr. Lester Pearson, a noted winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and a former Prime Minister of Canada, said recently that 'It is the sheerest hypocrisy for Governments to flee from their own responsibilities by blaming the world Organization'. We regret that it is becoming increasingly a fashion to denigrate the importance of the United Nations by what Mr. Pearson calls the tendency of Governements 'to flee from their own responsibilities'.
56.	India has made its contribution to the various United Nations peacekeeping operations. We hope that the differences on the initiation, control and financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations will be speedily resolved so that the United Nations can contribute more effectively to preserving peace. India accepts the principle of strengthening the machinery of peacekeeping by the United Nations and would consider concrete action after the modalities have been agreed upon.
57.	General and complete disarmament under international control is even more urgent today. The nuclear arms race and innovations in sophisticated delivery systems are making life on the planet daily more precarious. It deflects resources and energies from constructive work. It also leads to deadly competition, military blocs and spheres of influence.
58.	The Indian delegation will strive to ensure the success of the Disarmament Decade through a comprehensive program of disarmament for the next 10 years. We must concentrate our attention on general and complete disarmament, in particular nuclear disarmament. We realize that it may not be possible to achieve progress all at once and that collateral measures are expedient. We are aware of the tremendous contribution which the technology of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, including peaceful nuclear explosions, can make to the economy of the developing world. The benefits of this technology should be available to all States without any discrimination. At Lusaka the nonaligned nations indicated a general order of priorities which should be followed in drawing up the program for the Disarmament Decade.
59.	It is obvious that measures of nuclear disarmament such as cut off in the production of fissionable material for weapons purposes, a comprehensive test ban, reduction and destruction of stockpiles of nuclear weapons and so forth, should receive the highest priority. The next priority should be for other measures in the disarmament field, such as an agreement prohibiting the development, production and stockpiling of chemical and biological weapons and providing for their elimination from the arsenals of all nations.
60.	I should like to refer briefly to the de-nuclearization draft treaty relating to the seabed and ocean floor . The approval of the agreement on non-emplacement of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed beyond the twelve mile limit is to be welcomed, but it is only a limited disarmament measure in this field.
61.	My delegation is convinced that the seabed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and that the potential wealth of the area and its resources should be developed and used for the benefit of mankind as a whole. I should like to appeal to all representatives to make a sincere and determined effort to define the regime of the seas and to create an international machinery to regulate it before a mad rush to expropriate the resources of this last frontier sets in.
62.	As regards the conference on the law of the sea, my delegation supports the viewpoints expressed at the nonaligned summit in favor of convening a conference on the law of the sea at an early date, after adequate preparations have been made for it by a preparatory committee. We are of the opinion that all the questions, namely, the regimes of the high seas, the continental shelf, the territorial sea and the contiguous zone, fishing and conservation of the living resources of the high seas, etc., should be dealt with at the same time in a comprehensive manner, rather than in a piecemeal fashion.
63.	On the occasion of this twenty-fifth anniversary session of the United Nations we can derive some satisfaction from the contribution of this Organization in placing economic cooperation for development on a sound, rational and dynamic basis. We have a long way to go, however, in order to realize the fundamental objectives of the Charter for creating conditions of stability and wellbeing and for ensuring a minimum standard of living necessary for human worth and dignity.
64.	The gap separating the affluent and the poor nations has been widening rapidly; this is a serious threat to the independence of the developing countries and to international peace and security. Some of the recent trends in the field of international economic cooperation indicate that there has been a retreat from the high ideals of 1950s. Despite the endeavors of the developing countries to contribute their due and rightful share in the world economic life, the process of their continuous alienation from the mainstream of the world economy remains unabated.
65.	India views with favor, and looks forward with great expectation, to the effort of the international community to adopt an international development strategy for the seventies as a basis for solving the problem of poverty in a concerted manner and on a rational and comprehensive basis. My delegation would, therefore, commend to the Assembly the strong recommendation of the nonaligned nations that the General Assembly, at its commemorative session, should adopt a declaration on international development strategy for the 1970s.
66.	Such a concept does not admit of halfhearted measures undertaken in an isolated manner. What we need is a definition of goals and objectives and time bound policy measures to achieve them. The adoption of a mere declaratory resolution by the General Assembly, launching the Second United Nations
Development Decade, would not I repeat, not represent any point of departure, and hence our plea for a strategy of development which not only would provide for policy measures to enable the developing countries to overcome their current economic difficulties, but would also be l decisive move towards the objective of restructuring international economic relations on a just and equitable basis.
67.	The primary task for the implementation of the strategy would rest on the developing countries themselves. One of the most hopeful features of the past decade has been the determination shown by the developing countries to try to achieve economic and social progress through their own efforts. At the same time they have progressed also towards broadening and diversifying economic relations among themselves, with a view to imparting strength, to their national endeavors. It is our sincere hope that, consistent with the commitments undertaken by the developed countries in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and other forums, and as reflected in the draft international development strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [A',7982, para. 16] now under consideration by the General Assembly, the developed countries will assist in the implementation of concrete and specific schemes to be put forward by developing countries in the field of economic cooperation, and regional and sub regional integration among themselves.
68.	While we attempt to build the edifice of a secure peace at the United Nations we cannot overlook the conflicts that are currently raging in the world. The situation in VietNam continues to cause us deep concern. We recognize that all parties to the conflict have declared their adherence to the Geneva Agreements and their desire to achieve a peaceful solution in VietNam. The cessation of the bombing of the Democratic Republic of VietNam has been appreciated generally, as also the desire of all sides to continue the talks in Paris to find a peaceful settlement. In our view those talks can progress if there is an indication that all foreign forces will be withdrawn from VietNam. The United States Government already has withdrawn some troops, and we believe that a firm timetable, together with a date for final withdrawal, will help the negotiations in Paris. A broad based Government, comprising all elements of South VietNam, would be another factor which could contribute to the success of the negotiations.
69.	The eruption of fighting in Cambodia has increased the tension in that area. We earnestly hope that the people of Cambodia, with whom the Indian people have historic ties of culture and friendship, will be able to overcome all their internal difficulties and will be allowed to live in peace and friendship with their neighbors, without any interference from outside.
70.	In Laos the proposed negotiations between the parties are not making much headway.
71.	The conflict in the States of Indo-China has brought much distress and suffering to their people.
As a result of this series of conflicts the people of those countries have suffered grievously through death and destruction over the years. India has an abiding interest in peace and stability in that area. Everything should be done to put an end to this human misery.
72.	At present it would be difficult to discuss separately the problems of the States of Indo-China, and we believe that once the fighting in Indo-China is stopped it would be necessary to have an international conference to resolve the complex situation now gripping those States. India is prepared to join other States and interested parties in working out arrangements to ensure respect for the independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty and neutrality of all the States of Indo-China.
73.	West Asia is another region which is torn by bitter conflict and has not seen peace for many years. Israel continues to occupy large Arab territories seized in the 1967 conflict from which they must withdraw. The human problem of Arab refugees exiled from their homeland cannot be ignored and the just rights of the Palestinian people must be respected.
74.	The determination of the international community to take concrete steps to respect and protect the just and reasonable rights of the Palestinian people would provide the most effective and durable check against many desperate measures, including hijacking, which we all deplore and which cause much needless suffering to so many innocent people. We are glad that all the hostages have been released.
75.	The foundations of a just and lasting peace in West Asia were laid three years ago when the Security Council adopted resolution 242 (1967). This resolution must be fully implemented. My delegation hopes that the talks under the auspices of the SecretaryGeneral's Special Representative will take place without further delay or procrastination. We share the general concern for peace in this area and hope that the proposed talks will result in the implementation of the Security Council resolution of 1967 and a just and lasting peace in the area.
76.	While conflict and tension continue in Asia, there have been certain positive developments in Europe which we welcome. I refer to the nonaggression Treaty recently signed between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.  We hope that this development will open the way for further agreements to strengthen security in Europe. I should also like to express the hope that the bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic arms will bear fruit. This will not only be an important arms limitation measure but also a positive contribution to the general relaxation of tension in the world.
77.	International relations are entering a phase characterized by increasing interdependence on the one hand and the desire of States to pursue independent policies on the other. Scientific and technological innovations, rapid communication, increased commerce and ecological considerations are lowering the barriers between States and encouraging cooperation. Side by side, the international community remains separated by political, economic and racial barriers and prejudices; the weak continue to live in the shadow of the more powerful, and neither peace nor prosperity nor the right to independence and equality have yet become the integral attributes of all mankind. The United Nations is at the center of the world, attempting to restrain the aggressor, fighting greed and prejudice and promoting international cooperation on a just and equal basis.
78.	I am certain that the Heads of State and Government attending the commemorative session, beginning in a fortnight's time, will give the requisite lead to make our Organization more effective.
79.	The world today seems full of strife. Conflicts and conflagrations are unfortunately continuing. This naturally saddens us all especially when we meet to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. However, the situation is not entirely full of gloom and despair. Let us not fail to take note of the many areas in which significant progress towards peace and prosperity is being made. World peace has been maintained for a quarter of a century even though we have been unable to stop local wars. The pace of development in many parts of the world is gathering momentum. The threat of starvation has been lifted. The production of food grains in countries like India is not only matching current needs but also rising faster than the growth in the population. Each year more and more countries are throwing off the colonial yoke and declaring their determination to play their full part as independent, free nations.
80.	As the United Nations completes its twenty-fifth year, we can look to the future, not with despair and despondency but with hope and confidence.




"
25,1970,ITA,"72.	  Mr. President, I trust I may be allowed, first of all, to express the gratification of my Government and of the Italian delegation at seeing the representative of a friendly country, whose constant efforts have been dedicated to preserving peace, elected to the Presidency of the General Assembly. Your election is the best testimony of the unanimous esteem and prestige which you, an eminent representative of the democracy of your country, enjoy among us because of your legal erudition, your profound knowledge of international problems and your participation in the activity of the Organization since its very beginning.
73.	I should like also to address myself to your illustrious predecessor and to express to Mrs. Angie Brooks- Randolph our deep gratitude to her for having steered last session's proceedings with charm, wisdom and competence, thus gaining the confidence of us all.
74.	I also wish to associate myself with the tribute which has here been renewed to our Secretary-General. In U Thant we salute not only the symbol of the continuity of our Organization but also the faithful and devoted interpreter of the principles of the Charter. We express the most sincere wish that he may continue to serve the cause of the United Nations for a long time to come.
75.	Mr. President, I should like to express to you personally and to the Assembly the sincere regret of the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs at not having been able to take part in person, as he had wished, in this debate, since he is representing Italy at President Nasser's funeral in Cairo.

76.	Following the inspiring initiative taken yesterday [1855th meeting] by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, Mr. Carlos Romulo, I shall briefly summarize my statement, which is being distributed in its entire text with the understanding that it will be recorded verbatim as an annex to the minutes of this meeting. 
77.	The significant coincidence of this session with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations prompts me to begin my statement with a frankly realistic assessment: the results achieved by the United Nations in this quarter of a century have not so far fulfilled all our hopes, although the Organization represents a first important step in the evolution of the international community. We must, therefore, continue to concentrate our efforts with the aim of correcting the imperfections of The United Nations system in the existing institutional framework and of transforming the United Nations into an efficient and swift instrument for the preservation of peace.
78.	The problems of peace and security throughout the world must be considered in a global context: any partial solution would prove sterile and ephemeral, unless it were a part of that wider design that the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Mr. Aldo Moro, speaking from this same rostrum last year, defined as 'the strategy of peace' [1783rd meeting],
79.	Such a conclusion is particularly evident in relation to the problems on which I shall first concentrate my attention, as they are of preeminent interest for my country: the problems of Europe on the one hand, and those of the Middle East and the Mediterranean on the other.
80.	In Europe, we have witnessed several developments bound to exert a positive influence on the consolidation of peace and detente. The Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union is a good omen for the dialog which is being established between the two parts of Europe. In order to ensure a lasting contribution to the equilibrium in Europe, this dialog must proceed in step with new progress on the road to setting up a politically and economically integrated community in Western European countries, a community which we consider as open to co-operation on all its frontiers and towards all continents.
81.	To stress the constructive spirit which must lead our search for the solution of the problems of our continent, I shall recall the friendly climate which has been established in the relations between Italy and two of our neighbors: Yugoslavia and Austria.
82.	Concerning Austria, the Secretary-General was kind enough to mention, as a fruitful example of recourse to the procedures for solving controversies provided for in Article 33 of the Charter, the contacts that Italy has had with the Austrian Government on the Alto Adige question. The permanent missions of the Member countries have already been informed of the substantial progress accomplished by Italy and Austria towards settling the dispute regarding the interpretation and implementation of the 1946 Paris agreement. This dispute was the subject of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in its sessions of 1960 [1497 (XV)] and 1961 [1661 (XVI)].
83.	I should like to recall that the envisaged settlement is based on three elements. The first of these is the announcement made by the Italian Government in Parliament on 3 December 1969 regarding a series of measures which it intends to adopt in favor of the populations of Alto Adige. These measures aim at widening the legislative and administrative jurisdictions of the province of Bolzano. The second element is the statement made by the Austrian Government in the Nationalrat on 15 December 1969 according to which, once the measures outlined above have been carried out, it will consider as settled the controversy with Italy concerning the application of the Paris agreement. The third element is the conclusion and implementation of an agreement between Italy and Austria regarding the application of the European convention for the peaceful settlement of disputes.  The agreement aims at widening the application of this convention to cover controversies about facts or situations prior to the date when the said convention came into force.
84.	The first two stages of the envisaged solution have therefore already been acted upon. Italy, for its part, has taken other steps in performing the operations set forth for settling the disputes. All the administrative measures envisaged in the 'calendar of operations' have already been adopted. In particular, I shall mention the creation of the Preparatory Committee responsible for drawing up the draft constitutional law and the drafts of ordinary law. After 19 January 1970, in full observance of the limit indicated in the announcement of the Italian Government, we submitted to the Chamber of Deputies the draft constitutional law directed at modifying the statute of the Trentino-Alto Adige region. The competent parliamentary commission has already started its examination as an urgent matter. The drafts of ordinary laws concerning the further measures envisaged are under preparation. They will be submitted to Parliament in December, as announced.
85.	The Italian Government is following with constant attention the progress of the Alto Adige populations and will continue in its endeavors to carry out the measures envisaged. It expects that, on the Austrian side as well, all the necessary steps will be taken to fulfill the commitments undertaken. The Italian Government hopes that in the light of the initiatives already taken and those which it aims to undertake in the future, the relations between Italy and Austria will develop in a renewed climate of trust and concord, opening the way to an ever more intensive and rewarding collaboration.
86.	The hopeful note that has inspired my considerations on Europe must yield to the most serious anxiety when I proceed to reviewing the situation in the Middle East and.the Mediterranean, at a time when we must mourn the untimely demise of President Nasser.
87.	In joining in the unanimous tribute which has been paid to his memory from this rostrum we express the firm belief that the new leaders of the United Arab Republic will pursue the action undertaken with such determination by President Nasser in order to find a political solution to the conflict.
88.	All the recent events must spur us to renew our efforts towards the re-establishment of peace in the Middle East with the observance of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and the fulfillment of the need for security of all the parties involved in a balanced context, in which the future of the Palestinian people will no longer be considered solely in the light of its humanitarian aspects but also in that of its political elements. The security and integrity of the State of Israel, a Member of the United Nations, is a permanent aim of Italian policy as much as the security, integrity and development of the Arab countries. Equally essential is the need to set the desired solution of the conflict in the framework of a system of guarantees to be completed by a system for monitoring the supplying of armaments. Along those lines Italy has directed its action, which is aimed at overcoming tension and radicalism in an area of the world so near to it. Italy is always prepared to make a sensible contribution to ensure that stability, security and peace prevail in the Mediterranean. That was stated by the President of the Italian Republic, Giuseppe Saragat, in his address welcoming President Nixon to Rome.
89.	I should like to conclude my considerations on the Mediterranean by mentioning, not without regret, the relations between Italy and Libya. The measures of confiscation of property and of expulsion imposed upon the Italian community in Libya do not appear to us to have served the cause of Libya and its people. If a problem existed between the two countries, which are neighbors because of history as well as geography, it could have been solved in mutual agreement and through negotiation, so as to avoid the violation of international obligations and decisions taken by the United Nations, and in the light of the spirit of understanding and co-operation which has always inspired Italy's relations with all Arab countries.
90.	We are still convinced that a solution through bilateral negotiations to problems pending between Italy and Libya might constitute the basis for the resumption of fruitful co-operation between the two countries. We hope that such a solution may be reached in conformity with the principles of international law and of the United Nations Charter.
91.	Although the problems I have tackled most directly affect the interests of my country, they represent a detailed aspect of a broader problem, that of directing a global strategy of peace, as we conceive it, towards the settlement of regional conflicts jeopardizing peace and security, and of gradually eliminating the political, military, economic and social imbalances that cause tensions and conflicts.
92.	As far as the first aspect is concerned we must note with deep regret the enduring crisis in South-East Asia and the lack of substantive progress towards that political and negotiated settlement which, by respecting the will of the populations concerned, is the condition for restoring a lasting peace in that tormented area.
93.	On the other hand, we recall with deep satisfaction that peace has returned in Africa following the solution of the conflict which has shed the blood of the people of a great country, Nigeria. May that country, in a climate of reconciliation and concord, resume its place in the work for progress and peace upon which all the countries of that continent must embark.
94.	As far as the second aspect is concerned, I should now like to remark that the problem of eliminating the instruments of destruction remains before us in all its complex essence. In Geneva, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has achieved some progress in the field of so-called collateral measures for instance, in the case of the agreement on the draft treaty on the de-nuclearization of the seabed.  On the other hand, difficulties persist in relation to the banning of biological and chemical weapons, while there has been no initiative at all to extend the prohibition of nuclear tests. That is but a new argument to stress the need consistently voiced by the Italian Government to consider the problem of disarmament as a unified whole, without limiting the discussion to collateral measures, and, instead, facing the task of outlining an organic program for the actual reduction of armaments. In this context we are following with interest the development of the talks between the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation of strategic armaments. We express the wish that those talks will lead to results that will take into account the security requirements of non-nuclear-weapon countries and represent a first real step towards halting the arms race.
95.	No less important than disarmament for the renewal of international order is the elimination of any form of human discrimination and oppression. Colonial regimes and systems of apartheid are, from this viewpoint, intolerable and inconsistent with the international community as we conceive it. We therefore advocate that the action of the United Nations in that field be directed through peaceful means at reestablishing a more humane and democratic order in southern Africa.
96.	The celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples is a reminder of the Organization's responsibility in this field. The same ideals of solidarity and understanding extolled in that Declaration must also inspire our stand on the problems of development, as we firmly believe that the establishment of a greater social justice throughout the international community is also an essential condition for building peace.
97.	The global strategy of development for the next decade provides the basis for organically programming development and rationalizing the use of available resources, including the aspects concerning the necessary co-ordination and simplification of the intervention carried out under the aegis of the United Nations.
98.	The structural and functional strengthening of the United Nations also implies the need to face the problem of giving a truly universal dimension to the Organization as is required by its functions and responsibilities. In this context we hope that the People's Republic of China, with which Italy is negotiating for recognition and establishment of diplomatic relations, will take on the international responsibilities facing it and contribute to the strengthening of peace in the world.
99.	If we really want to strengthen the United Nations it is necessary that all Member States be willing to sacrifice 'la raison d'Etat' to the reason of peace, which requires respect for a universal order founded on law and aimed at progress and co-operation among peoples.
100.	Although the results achieved by the United Nations towards this end may appear modest, nevertheless the Organization offers us the potential of its structures, means and systems that we shall usefully use, provided we realize the logic of the present evolution consisting in a gradual process for overcoming national interests in order to arrive at increasingly organized forms of collective solidarity. The twenty- fifth anniversary of the United Nations provides a favorable occasion to embark upon this gigantic political and moral effort, directed at achieving the three aims which inspire this United Nations General Assembly: peace, justice and progress.





"
25,1970,LBR,"49.	 It gives me great pleasure, Mr. President, to extend to you sincere congratulations of the Liberian delegation and myself on your election as President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.
50.	You bring to this high office a richness in experience not easily matched, a store of knowledge not readily equaled, and a brilliant career rare in age and fullness. With the experience you have gained from the founding of this Organization, I think we are indeed fortunate to have such a capable and seasoned scholar, diplomat and statesman as you, Mr. President, to guide and direct the deliberations of this Assembly. In wishing you well, let me assure you, on behalf of the Liberian delegation, of our co-operation and support.
51.	I should like to take advantage of this opportunity also to pay a deserved and justified tribute to your predecessor, Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph, of our own delegation who handled the deliberations of the twenty- fourth session of the General Assembly so ably as to merit the admiration and praise very readily and willingly accorded by all.
52.	The energy, efforts, sincerity and devotion in the service of the United Nations, as well as the constant dedication to the cause of international peace and co-operation, manifested by the Secretary-General, continue to command and merit the complete respect and approbation of all. As he leads the Organization into its second quarter of a century, the delegation of Liberia wishes to reassure him of its continued support in the difficult days ahead.
53.	A pall has fallen over this Assembly because of the sudden passing of a great and outstanding African leader, President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic. This distinguished leader dedicated himself to the promotion of the interests of his people and worked untiringly for their advancement and development. He also lost himself in the cause of the Arab people. He was an affable and pragmatic person and he sought peace which unfortunately eluded him. The grief which his death has brought to his family and the Egyptian people is shared by all Africans and by people throughout the world. His untimely death is felt by us all. My delegation extends sincere sympathy to the delegation of the United Arab Republic.
54.	This important session of the General Assembly convenes at a time when the United Nations effectiveness seems to be creating doubt rather than certainty and when international peace and security seem to be giving way to unrest and confusion. The observance of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization is an ideal opportunity for reflection, stocktaking, reexamination and reappraisal.
55.	In 1945, moved by the enormity of the destruction and the extent of human suffering of the Second World War, and stirred by prevailing world opinion stemming from the aspirations of millions of people, world states-men attempted to build an organization, universal in character and general in scope to influence the destiny of man. Beginning with the Atlantic Charter in 1941, the Declaration by the United Nations in 1942, the Moscow Declaration in 1943, and the Dumbarton Oaks conversations and proposals in 1944 as well as the Yalta Conference in 1945, the United Nations Conference on International Organization was convened in San Francisco and the Charter was drafted in 1945.
56.	The United Nations thus appeared to be the modern world's response to catastrophe, man's inexorable and eternal search for peace as well as for the general improvement of conditions for productive exchanges and interrelationships among nations and peoples.
57.	The history of the United Nations, founded as an international organization of nations to maintain international peace, to promote international cooperation and to advance the general welfare of man, covers a period riddled with changes unparalleled in human history.
58.	The outburst of scientific knowledge and inventions included, among other things, nuclear and thermonuclear discoveries and uses, outer space achievements including lunar expeditions and landings, the electronic use of satellites, and other advances.
59.	Political development, too, has made tremendous strides during the last quarter of a century. In this period, much of the world consisting of hundreds of millions of people has thrown off the shackles of colonialism. Since the birth of the United Nations, some 59 of these former dependent Territories have become independent nations and have joined the Organization itself. In little over a week the Fiji Islands will be ushered into independence and my Government extends its best wishes to the people of that Territory.
60.	Concurrent with these changes have been the eagerness and response of over a billion people inhabiting more than one fourth of the surface of the earth, clamoring in their demand for economic and social justice. Youth, too, more than ever is making demands for a share in the organization and administration of society.
61.	Twenty-five years ago in San Francisco, hopes were high. A formula which would provide for a thenceforth peaceful world was expected by all a world in which wealthy nations would be ready, willing and eager to assist in raising the living standards and aiding the development of millions of the downtrodden; a world in which enjoyment of fundamental human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as respect for the dignity and worth of the human person would be respectively shared and practiced by all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.
62.	Unfortunately, however, the principal aims and objectives of the United Nations outlined in the Charter have not yet been met. It is particularly regrettable that the obligation to maintain international peace has not been kept. This disappointment does not seem to stem from any constitutional restriction, as the Charter has proved to be remarkably adaptable under changing conditions and in the face of unforeseen challenges.
63.	Moreover, this apparent failure cannot be ascribed conveniently to administration. The records show that the Secretaries-General of the United Nations have exemplified exceptional foresight and boldness. They have shown great dedication to their onerous responsibilities but they have not had the unflinching support to which they have been entitled during this period especially from the big Powers.
64.	With the euphoria surrounding the approaching victory of the allied forces in the Second World War, and the apparent co-operation among the big Powers, there was an underlying assumption at San Francisco that understanding and co-operation among the big Powers, which had ensured success in the war would continue in times of peace, and that big Power cooperation would prevent further wars. It was hoped that the Charter would be an instrument of justice and orderliness in international relations, a basis of respect for fundamental human rights, human dignity and equal rights for all, a means by which social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom would be realized, a medium to promote tolerance and good neighborliness, and the machinery which would preserve international peace and security.
65.	Perhaps human thought and action must always be judged in the context of the related circumstances and pressures of the times, for in the thought and corresponding action at San Francisco at the formation of the Organization, based on the assumption of big Power unanimity, lay the most elementary fallacy.
66.	No sooner had the Organization entered its infancy on that basic assumption than it became evident that the interests of the big Powers were different and sometimes opposed. Almost at once two super Powers emerged among the Big Five and developed into leaders in the cold war struggle, the result of which has had and continues to have an indelible effect on the United Nations.
67.	One of the principal difficulties which affects the progress of the United Nations stems from the provision of the Charter giving the veto power to the five permanent members of the Security Council.
68.	As I have already stated, post-war developments have demonstrated that the veto has been misused to the detriment of the international community. The granting of special rights to a few States Members of the United Nations is undemocratic and the exercise of such a right seems arbitrary. My Government therefore recommends the abolition of this special right and suggests that, as in the General Assembly, majority votes should control decisions in the Security Council.
69.	The history of the United Nations over the past 25 years in relation to the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the world expressed in the Charter leaves much to be desired.
70.	Nevertheless, the test of success or failure of such an international organization co-ordinating and promoting international relations in the political, social, economic, technical, and cultural fields should not be measured by reverses in the political arena alone, for even here, there have been some successes. As already mentioned, several States now Members of this Organization doubtless obtained independence partly as a result of the efforts of the United Nations, and several conflicts have been avoided on account of the tactful and timely efforts of the United Nations.
71.	It is mainly in the field of human activity involving measures to develop and improve economic, social and humanitarian co-operation that the work of the United Nations seems to be quietly but steadily progressing. Some effort has been made by the United Nations Development Program and the activities of the specialized agencies, and the success in these fields can be verified by rather impressive figures drawn from the reports on their work.
12'. The field of human rights provides another positive aspect of United Nations activities. For example, in December 1948 the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [resolution 217 A (III)]. It was an important milestone setting an ideal for human rights throughout the world. Since then there has been a broad expansion of the United Nations Program in this field.
73.	There is no doubt that, whilst we are still far from the ultimate attainment of the ideal, the human rights declaration has influenced laws and constitutions of some countries. But we tend too often to lose sight of the work of the United Nations in the social, economic and humanitarian fields, mainly because it is not very dramatic. Yet because of these positive achievements I feel that these activities should be increased, intensified and strengthened so that impressive technological developments can be harnessed to facilitate the improvement of man and his general welfare, rather than his destruction and the devastation of his environment. It is on that note that my delegation welcomes the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment which is scheduled to take place two years hence in Stockholm.
74.	Some of us think that there is a certain measure of security today because atomic and hydrogen bombs, and other weapons of mass destruction, maintain a balance of terror. But apart from the inherent fallacy of that argument, it is evident that in those parts of the world where the great Powers do not confront each other directly, wars have not ceased.
75.	Indeed, there can be no real peace when people are suppressed, oppressed and treated with gross injustice.
76.	There exist today serious crises which the United Nations has not solved. The diabolical policy of apartheid not only continues in South Africa but is being expanded; South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia has not been ended; the illegal Ian Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia is being entrenched; the colonial Portuguese suppression in Africa remains unabated; divided countries pose problems that continue to increase tensions; and the Middle East crisis, with all its risks, awaits a peaceful solution. These are but a few.
77.	Today the major industrial nations together have the technical and scientific means at their disposal to contribute to the eradication of conflict and to the creation of an efficient international system of order.
78.	Again and again the delegation of Liberia has emphasized that world peace requires an extraordinary effort. The Government of Liberia is totally committed to universal peace, involving the maintenance of peace both at home and abroad. The following is a brief quotation from a recent restatement of President Tubman's foreign policy, declaring Liberia's commitment to universal peace:
'We shall seek to maintain cordial relations with all States, particularly Member States of the United
Nations and the Organization of African Unity. We shall continue to work for peace at home and contribute to universal peace to the maximum of our abilities. We shall not only seek peace but pursue it with all our might. We shall not only strive to be a peace-loving nation but we shall act upon that principle.
'We believe in the principles contained in the Treaty signed at Paris on 27 August 1928, commonly referred to as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, because it condemns recourse to war and renounces it as an instrument of national policy. While the United Nations Charter places an obligation on all Member States to settle their international disputes by peaceful means, and some believe that this represents an advance, we do not think it is enough. I think that an open and positive statement from the United Nations outlawing war is necessary.'
79.	We continue to hold the view even more strongly with the passage of time that an open and positive commitment for peace would provide a sober and realistic basis for man's future. In that perspective my Government welcomed as an important step worthy of emulation the recent Treaty between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany  both for its renunciation of force and its recognition of existing boundaries, and we hope that it will be strictly adhered to.
80.	My delegation also welcomes the initiative of the Government of the United States of America in obtaining a cease-fire in the Middle East. The situation there calls for the establishment of mutual confidence and much self-discipline on all sides if the negotiations now sponsored by the United Nations are to achieve any success. And it is our hope that the willingness to silence the guns and negotiate will bring about success in the search for peace.
81.	The threat to international peace which the situation in southern Africa poses has been steadily increasing. During the life of the United Nations with its aim, among others,' 'to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small', the Organization has from its beginning been faced with and challenged by the problems in southern Africa.
82.	The Government of South Africa has sought to make a virtue of its brutal and senseless policy of apartheid and continues to deny to the majority of the people of that country the basic human rights enshrined in the Charter. An important aspect of the ignominious practice of apartheid is its effect of undermining the efforts of the United Nations. The degree of challenge to the authority of the United Nations is to be measured by the assistance given to the Government of South Africa by many important Governments.
83.	After a quarter of a century of dealing ineffectively with apartheid the United Nations must choose between meeting the challenge effectively or permitting its own authority to wane correspondingly.
84.	South Africa as a signatory of the Charter and a Member of the United Nations has pledged under Article 56 'to take joint and separate action in cooperation with the Organization for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55'. That Article requires us to promote 'universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion'.
85.	In violation of that legal commitment the South African Government continues not only to practice apartheid in South Africa but also to cultivate this heinous policy of racial discrimination in Namibia, a Mandated Territory which is now a United Nations responsibility as a result of the revocation of the Mandate.
86.	The Government of South Africa continues to defy world opinion and its position is being helped by others largely because of economic considerations.
87.	Those and other reasons have been advanced for the continued as well as the renewed sale of arms to South Africa. The potential sellers argue that the desire to resume sales is the result of a fifteen-year-old bilateral agreement, that the arms and ammunition would be sold solely for external defence and that this is a competitive world in which there are many sellers and where there is financial benefit to be obtained. Apart from the difficulty of clearly differentiating between defensive and offensive weapons, we do not think it helps to support such interests at all costs or at any price; nor do we think that international peace and security is fostered by introducing ideology in what all of us should consider a tragedy of great proportions.
88.	A confrontation on racial lines is building up in southern Africa, and the South African Government is mainly to blame for it. Let it be remembered that it is in the interest of South Africa indeed in the interest of the world which has suffered enough from bigotry, prejudice and hatred for the Government of South Africa to abandon its policy of racial discrimination and to provide for the South African majority the common enjoyment of basic human rights.
89.	Measures taken by the United Nations with a view to ending the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia have been flouted and the minority regime seems to be even more firmly established now. Step by step the rebellious regime has been aided and allowed, directly and indirectly, to perpetuate its intransigence to the detriment of the African majority, thereby fostering a serious threat to peace.
90.	The 1965 unilateral declaration of independence and subsequent illegal acts of the Smith regime have led to the March 1970 declaration of a republic which is equally illegal. In the face of those developments, the administering Power has remained conveniently unable to use the force necessary to assert its jurisdiction. Judging from the past history of the United Kingdom one is left to wonder whether the excuse is more one of inability to meet its obligation to the people of Zimbabwe or one of unwillingness.
91.	The strength or weakness of the United Nations must be measured against the respect and honor for its decisions, especially when they take the form of sanctions imposed by the Security Council to ensure international peace and security. The more violations of those decisions there are the weaker the Organization is likely to become.
92.	We will have to choose between perpetuating and strengthening the United Nations or allowing sur-mountable disruptions to continue to undermine its efforts.
93.	The same kinds of considerations apply to the persistent Portuguese colonial domination of millions of Africans whose hope for freedom has long been linked with the United Nations. The decolonization efforts of the United Nations met with much success during the past two decades, providing assistance in the birth of many new States. Unfortunately, the pace of this trend has been retarded. The twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations and the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples provide an appropriate opportunity for a prompt renewal of the United Nations efforts to end colonial domination if the United Nations is to grow and not dwindle in strength.
94.	Hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars are still being poured into a gigantic arms race. It is unfortunate that so much of the world's resources and money has had to be spent for purposes other than productive necessities in view of the legitimate pressing need and urgent demand by over a thousand million people in the world for social and economic advancement.
95.	Whilst we welcome the beginning of strategic arms limitation talks by the Soviet Union and the United States and wish that they will be successful, we are anxious to see progress in the disarmament discussions which have been going on in Geneva for the last eight years and we cherish the hope that the super-Powers will abandon purely selfish aims and recognize their responsibility to mankind as a whole. To continue to do otherwise would be to leave man's future to chance. We must have disarmament if we are to survive.
96.	The sea-bed, the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction provide an opportunity for greater co-operation among all States through the United Nations. The General Assembly appointed a Committee  to examine the question of reserving the area exclusively for peaceful purposes and exploiting its resources for the benefit of mankind.
97.	The vastness of the sea-bed and ocean floor, the potential wealth of the area, the development of technology permitting gradual but effective exploitation of the resources of the area, the uncertainty relating to behavior in the area and the potential danger and threat to international peace and security; all these and other factors gave prominence to consideration of this question. Accordingly the United Nations attached importance to the establishment of the sea-bed Committee as well as to the work which the Committee was expected to perform.
98.	Regrettably, the failure of the Committee to reach agreement on the proposals to be submitted to this Assembly for consideration causes disappointment. On the other hand, it appears that it has succeeded in identifying the various positions on which compromise is evidently wanting. There can be no success in establishing a satisfactory basis for co-operation without a spirit of compromise, and we hope that the sea-bed Committee will assume the responsibility that has been imposed upon it.
99.	As we enter the decade of the 1970s, it is not satisfactory to say that within this Organization there are nations which are straggling to survive on per capita incomes of less than $100 while there are others abounding in affluence. We have said that too often. Despite the fact that the problems which plague the developing countries have been underscored and priorities laid down, the pace of efforts towards improving general living standards remains seriously frustrating.
100.	While we recognize that the United Nations has made some progress in promoting the economic and social advancement of peoples of the developing countries, nevertheless we believe that some Member nations have not sufficiently demonstrated unselfish international goodwill.
101.	This Organization is but a reflection of our collective will. Its shortcomings can be found only in the shortcomings of our national incapacities in adhering to the ideals we have set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.
102.	Today, and at the beginning of this decade, we find that man is still committed to his survival and therefore to the concept of peace. Despite the fragile nature of this peace, our only alternative is to strengthen it. To do this, man must reach out, beyond his family and nation, to other men and share that which by nature has become his material acquisition.
103.	Nations must see their national interests only as they relate to the interests of mankind. In economic matters we must adopt a new approach to planning, for the developing countries are no longer prepared to accept the economic exploitation of the past. They are prepared to develop their economies only within a community of interest.
104.	The Pearson report  and the capacity study of the United Nations Development Program  have clearly analyzed the situation. They drew upon the past and gave us a point from which we can move into an arena of greater international economic cooperation. The nature of international economics makes it imperative that we strive to strengthen our economic position in the world, working from sub- regional and regional premises.
105.	Under the umbrella of the United Nations we have the opportunity not only to work together, but to work with others. This must be our commitment to the decade of the 1970s and this attitude must be reflected in the strategy which will guide our efforts during the second quarter of the century.
106.	For both the developed and the developing countries, the concept of national will takes on greater meaning every day. During this session my Government would wish the decisions of the Assembly with regard to international economic co-operation to reflect this greater meaning in a positive way.
107.	The hijacking of aircraft is creating considerable uneasiness throughout the world and if allowed to continue unchecked it could pose a dangerous threat to international peace and security.
108.	We joined the Organization of African Unity in its resolution condemning the hijacking and sabotaging of civil aircraft, and we support the Security Council resolution [286 (1970)] calling upon all States to take measures to protect, and ensure the safety of those traveling by air. We call upon the United Nations to react positively to this question.
109.	Secretary-General U Thant, who has dedicated himself to the principles of the Charter and to selfless service of this Organization, stated during his visit to Liberia last January that the decade of the 1970s should be the decade of the three Ds: decolonization, disarmament and development. My Government would derive much satisfaction if, as a tribute to this distinguished and dedicated international statesman, the United Nations pursued policies which would make this ideal a reality, especially as we enter the second quarter of a century of the Organization's life,




"
25,1970,KEN,"
36.	 Mr. President, on behalf of His Excellency, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, the President of the Republic of Kenya and my delegation, I am happy to extend congratulations to you on your election to the Presidency of this august Assembly. We are convinced that under your inspiring and able guidance, the present session will be characterized by success, goodwill and understanding.
37.	I should at the same time pay a well-deserved tribute to the outgoing President, Mrs. Angie Brooks Randolph of Liberia. She guided the deliberations of the twenty-fourth session with distinction. In a situation of divided counsels and conflicting views, she acted with speed, precision and decisiveness.
38.	As the world community commemorates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, numerous achievements stand to its credit.
39.	The role of the United Nations in accelerating the process of decolonization represents the pinnacle of its success. Peoples formerly afflicted by the humiliation of colonization stand today as sovereign nations, proud of their sovereignty, dignity and playing their full role in international affairs. The record of the United Nations in promoting fundamental human rights throughout the world is worthy of note. When international peace and world order have been challenged, the United Nations has exercised a sobering influence on the side of peace and justice. Shooting wars have been controlled and commendable endeavors made to bring the parties in conflict to the conference table. It may not have eliminated disputes every time, but it has on numerous occasions extinguished the flames of open warfare through diplomacy, negotiation and mediation. This is not a mean achievement, considering that the power politics of the nuclear age have constantly threatened to bring the opposing sides to a face-to-face confrontation. Through its comprehensive network of specialized agencies, important development activities have been initiated. These have greatly benefited the new nations of the Third World. They have embraced such vital fields as agriculture, technical cooperation, public health, development planning, education, international finance and a host of other activities too many to be enumerated here. The Kenya Government is deeply appreciative of the splendid work of the United Nations Development Program, not only in Kenya but in other countries as well.
40.	While much has been achieved by the United Nations a lot remains to be done. Vast populations in Africa are still condemned to servitude and oppression. The clash of arms in certain parts of the world continues to disrupt peace and progress. Problems of poverty, illiteracy and disease still haunt the conscience of mankind. The gap between the industrialized and the developing nations is ever widening; this process is hastened by the technological advances not shared by the less fortunate members of the world community. The undiminished tempo of the arms race, particularly in areas of acknowledged conflict, remains a source of deep anxiety to mankind as a whole.
41.	I wish to address the Assembly on African issues first.
42.	In South Africa, the odious philosophy of apartheid still continues to flourish. The African there is subjected to the vilest forms of oppression and indignity. The most basic human rights are denied him; his traditional life and culture is deliberately tampered with to break his spirit and hope. Any voice of dissent is silenced; any effort towards self-determination is ruthlessly crushed. The overwhelming majority of Africans are held in bondage through the force of arms and repressive laws. In enforcing the transfer of populations involving large-scale settlement of aliens under the Group Areas Act, the African is uprooted from his ancestral land and others settled there. This has often inflicted desperation, humiliation and bitter suffering on the African. There seems to be no glimmer of light in the long night of oppression that has descended in that country. The entire world is witness to the enactment of this tragedy of unknown dimensions. While this body has condemned this situation in the strongest possible terms, it is regrettable that there are some Member nations which give solace and comfort to this system. They uphold this order through economic backing, through supply of arms and through other measures which entrench this minority racist regime further in power.
43.	It is ironic to condemn apartheid in seemingly strong terms and at the same time to sustain and strengthen it by the back door; it is contradictory to support self-determination in southern Africa and at the same time to stifle it by arming the supremacist regime to the hilt; it is idle to pretend concern for the welfare of Africans while the oppressive racist regime is being given aid and comfort, and it is incompatible to love and hate the minority racist regime at the same time. Very soon, a choice must be made between support for freedom and slavery, between short-term economic profit and longterm political and economic accommodation with Africa, and between the retrogressive forces of apartheid and the progressive forces of racial harmony. It is evident that no country can be friendly to both these diametrically opposed elements.
44.	Kenya is opposed to the sale of arms, either actual or intended, to South Africa by any country in the world. This stand received unqualified endorsement at the recent summit of the Organization of African Unity in Addis Ababa  and at the nonaligned summit in Lusaka. It is noteworthy that the Lusaka Conference was attended by the representatives of about half the population of the world, It is our ardent hope that the overwhelming majority of Member States of the United Nations will readily pronounce themselves in a positive manner on this issue of vital importance to Africa and to the world.
45.	We are opposed to the sale of arms to South Africa because it poses a threat to the security, unity and sovereignty of Africa. It will consolidate the stranglehold of the existing regime in South Africa over the defenseless Africans. It will promote collusion on an unprecedented scale amongst the South African racists, the Portuguese colonizers and the Rhodesian rebels against independent Africa. It will strangle African freedom movements and unleash racial conflagration, thereby posing a definite threat to international peace and security. In its correct perspective, this development could potentially be more dangerous than the ideological conflict in which the East and the West are locked.
46.	African countries are entitled to ask: against what aggression will those arms be used? Against what disruptive forces will they be directed?
47.	Our well-founded conviction is that they can be used only for internal repression against the African; they can be directed only to implement the expansionist dreams of Pretoria, as is already apparent in Namibia, where modern weapons are being used to secure the capitulation of the African will to the racists of South Africa, and they can be used only to sabotage the political independence and territorial integrity of free Africa.
48.	No Government can give a demonstrable guarantee that the arms supplied to the racists will not be used for internal repression or external aggression against the sovereign African States. Furthermore, even if a guarantee were given and subsequently breached by South Africa, would the arms suppliers to South Africa come to the rescue of the victim of
South African aggression? Our firm view is that no such rescue operation will be launched by them in defense of the African. Were that not the case, the Rhodesian problem would have been tackled differently; were that not the case, Namibia would not have been allowed to fall victim to the avarice of South Africa.
49.	I wish also to stress that we have no faith in the word of the Pretoria regime. Its defiance of world opinion, its flagrant violation of United Nations resolutions and its institutionalized contempt for human rights are sufficient to prove its unworthiness as a guardian of either the security or the welfare of the oppressed African population in southern Africa. The arming of South Africa is tantamount to placing the security of Africa in the hands of racists who observe no norm of civilized international conduct.
50.	It is clear that the entirely negative attitude of South Africa is an open affront to the principles and objectives enshrined in the United Nations Charter. It has violated these with impunity; it has refused to cooperate with the United Nations on every issue, including its policies towards Namibia and its own population. It rejected the Lusaka Manifesto which was an attempt to bring about a peaceful settlement of the problem in South Africa. That Manifesto was fully supported by the Organization of African Unity and duly brought before the United Nations General Assembly for endorsement. For similar reasons South Africa was expelled from numerous international bodies, including the Commonwealth, in which it shared membership with its kith and kin. Considering all those things, it is time that the question of its continued membership in the United Nations should be seriously reviewed.
51.	The Kenya Government is much encouraged by the attitude of certain countries, like Canada, which have displayed statesmanship, courage and appreciation of the existing realities by taking an enlightened stand, similar to that of African countries, on the question of South Africa. This has evoked spontaneous admiration in Africa. Other friends of South Africa could well emulate this example.
52.	The situation in Namibia continues to be grave. South Africa is tenaciously holding on to that Territory despite its clear international status. We shall continue to support all United Nations efforts to restore self determination to that Territory by all means at our disposal. This Territory will never be allowed to fall a victim to the expansionist ambitions of Pretoria.
53.	Africa is plagued not only by the racists of South Africa, but also by the fascists of Portugal. They want to perpetuate their hold on Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) by advancing the fictitious claim that these Territories are overseas provinces of Portugal. Their creed Is to obliterate organized African movements by the infliction of suffering on, and the slaughter of, the defenseless and innocent African population. The generous assistance received from some of the Member States of this Organization, or from other sources, has been diverted to the extermination of liberation movements in Portugal's colonies. Despite its plunder of African Territories, Portugal remains a glaring example of economic failure at home. My delegation urges the enlightened element of Portuguese opinion to exert pressure on the Portuguese Government to reverse its present unrealistic colonial policy and to pave the way peacefully for majority African rule in these African Territories.
54.	The Portuguese administration, in collaboration with certain other countries, is currently engaged in the execution of the CaboraBassa project in Mozambique. It is described as a powergenerating and irrigation project for the economic advancement of Portuguese Territories. In actual fact, the scheme is intended to perpetuate the hold of the white racist minority over these Territories by opening up this vast and fertile area for white settlement. The exploitation of the rich mineral resources will feed the sagging Portuguese economy, and the toil and sweat of the Africans will be used to enrich the colonialists. That is nothing short of organized plunder. South Africa is, of course, a willing accomplice in this, hoping to create a buffer zone for inflicting grievous losses on the freedom fighters there. The improved navigability of the Zambezi River will enable South African gunboats to operate from the heart of Africa. Many Governments, appreciating the dangerous consequences of Portuguese ambitions, have seen fit to force their companies to withdraw from this project. We commend the action of such Governments, including those of Sweden and Italy.
55.	We are, however, deeply distressed that there are other Governments which so far still deem it wise to ignore African protests. No civilized country can allow itself to be trapped in the humiliating incongruity of supporting Portuguese domination and at the same time professing love for African self-determination. Such a policy will arouse volatile emotions and deep indignation all over Africa.
56.	My Government continues to be profoundly disturbed by events in Zimbabwe. The liberation of Zimbabwe remains the primary responsibility of Britain. But we in Africa are not going to stand still while Smith's illegal regime is still in power. We African countries are committed to advancing the liberation of that country by moral and material support; through the United Nations, through the Organization of African Unity and by every other conceivable method open to us.
57.	To all the supremacist regimes, free, independent Africa offered the Lusaka Manifesto. It was a very reasonable proposal for a dialog to solve the colonial issues equitably and without the use of force.
58.	The Manifesto emphasized the ultimate inevitability of African representative majority rule but by peaceful change. It upheld basic human rights and the freedom of all, without regard to any discrimination based on color, race, creed or religion. It pleaded for racial harmony, understanding and cooperation as vital tools in breaking the current impasse in South Africa. In exposing the inequities and irrationalities of apartheid, it solicited peaceful change, not by bullets but by a sincere change of heart. It was rejected by the minority racist regimes. That is not surprising as they are no respecters of international order, goodwill or peace. Every other conceivable method to bring about a peaceful solution has been tried and contemptuously spurned by the racists. In such circumstances, what is our choice? Our choice is to secure freedom for our enslaved brothers, peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must. That remains our ultimate, sacred and inescapable duty. We shall not relent until our objective is achieved. We shall not be daunted by peril, nor wearied by unrelenting toil and sacrifice. No matter how long the struggle and heavy the sacrifice, we shall fight for African freedom. One day justice will triumph over oppression, freedom over servitude, and human dignity over humiliation.
59.	Having briefly surveyed the African scene, I wish to turn my attention to the other issues of concern to the world community.
60.	The Middle East crisis, despite numerous peace initiatives, is far from being resolved. Kenya believes that a negotiated political settlement on the basis of the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967 [242 (1967)] is the real basis for peace in this area so long ravaged by war of attrition. Any durable solution must be based on justice and realism.
61.	Kenya welcomes any initiative. The Rogers plan, resulting in a limited ceasefire in the war zones, was worked out under the auspices of the United Nations. I must congratulate Israel, the United Arab Republic and Jordan for the remarkable courage and statesmanship they displayed in accepting this proposal, and also the United States of America and the USSR for supporting it.
62.	Despite the numerous difficulties faced by the Gunnar Jarring mission, we sincerely hope that it will be rewarded with the success that it so richly deserves. It is not to the advantage of any Power to perpetuate a situation of armed confrontation which has already led to a tragic loss of life and property. It is not in the interests of any party to have the Suez Canal closed to international trade and shipping. In the cause of world peace and security, it is imperative that normality should be restored to this area.
63.	With regard to the crisis in VietNam, my Government believes that a politically negotiated settlement in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreements of 1954 is possible. The people of VietNam as a whole, by exercise of free consent, should be the masters of their own destiny. Any forms of external intervention, irrespective of the source from which they emanate, can only complicate the already precarious situation. The Kenya Government is much encouraged by the withdrawal of American troops from VietNam and hopes that the talks being conducted in Paris are crowned with early and complete success. 
64.	There are other general international issues on which I wish to pronounce the views of my Government.
65.	On the question of disarmament and arms control, it is imperative that concrete steps should be taken to achieve the objective of general and complete disarmament by international agreement under clearly established international controls. The partial nuclear test-ban Treaty of 19635 and the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] are important landmarks in the march towards the ultimate objective of disarmament. The strategic arms limitation talks and recent arrangements for lessening tension in Europe are indications that the world is striving to move along the desirable path. Kenya welcomes the moves to create nuclear-free zones in the various continents and would like Africa and the oceans around it to be declared a nuclear-free zone.
66.	On the question of the seabed and ocean floor, it is important to adopt legal principles to govern the activities on the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Equally imperative that international machinery should be devised to administer these activities. In principle, Kenya fully supports the idea that the seabed beyond nations! jurisdiction is not subject to national appropriation and that it is a 'common heritage of mankind'..It is important that the seabed should be reserved exclusively for peaceful uses, and that its vast resources should be utilized for the benefit of mankind as a whole.
67.	The Kenya Government is in favor of a comprehensive conference to deal with all aspects of the law of the sea, including the international seabed regime, as soon as possible.
68.	My Government also supports measures to strengthen the United Nations as an institution for peace, progress and international understanding. That is why we support a revision of the Charter. The use of the veto power has considerably weakened the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations in times of emergency. The United Nations has been paralyzed by inaction when the great Powers have endeavored to place their own interests above those of peace and security. The successful^ operation of the United Nations has been held at ransom by certain Members who threatened the Organization with bankruptcy through non-contributions. The economic development and technical cooperation activities of the United Nations and its specialized agencies should be further scrutinized to increase their scope and effectiveness through overall coordination.
69.	Ideological confrontation between the East and the West, and political ambitions of certain Powers, have at times threatened the sovereignty of small States. Intervention in the affairs of the smaller States has led to the violation of their territorial integrity. These developments are a direct negation of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Unless such tendencies are checked with a sense of urgency, international peace and order would be disrupted to the core.
70.	On economic issues, I shall confine myself very briefly to the Second United Nations Development Decade. An international development strategy [A 17982] has been painstakingly negotiated. It not only concerns itself with the classical economic issues of trade and aid, but also social development. This comprehensive approach is welcomed by my Government.
71.	Although difficulties in obtaining consensus on the terms of the draft strategy have been experienced, it is hoped that a spirit of accommodation will prevail during the commemorative session and that complete agreement will be reached on the controversial issues.
72.	It is particularly important that objectives of the strategy should be unequivocally formulated, policy measures should be well defined, and review and appraisal machinery should be effectively devised.
73.	It is equally important that the flow of resources to emergent nations should increase; that the share of developing countries in world trade should progressively rise under fair and stabilized prices for their primary goods; that market access of their imports to developed countries must be ensured; that modern technology should be transferred to the developing countries; and that terms of trade and aid, both bilateral and multilateral, should be more favorable.
74.	In addition, my Government strongly advocates the immediate launching of the development strategy to coincide with the commemorative session.
75.	In conclusion, I wish to urge Member States of the United Nations to become comrades in arms for defense of peace, progress, justice and understanding; not rivals in power to sabotage the work of the United Nations.
76.	As the United Nations starts the next twenty-five years of challenging work, we should give it renewed vitality through concrete and continuous support and show what we can do for the United Nations and mankind."
25,1970,TUN,"83.	  Mr. President, it is my pleasure to speak at a time when you are presiding over our meeting. I should be very obliged to you if you would transmit the following message to Mr. Hambro:
'Mr. President, I have the pleasure of placing in younger and stronger hands the torch they will hold higher than we have done in order to light the way towards greater freedom for men and for nations.'
Those words were spoken on 8 April 1946 by President Hambro senior at the close of the last session of the Assembly of the League of Nations, the last meeting of the body of which our Organization is the successor.
84.	It is now for our President, the worthy son of an illustrious servant of mankind, to be the torchbearer at a historic turning point in the life of the United Nations. On this Twenty-fifth anniversary we must, by our thoughts and acts, rise to the challenge of history. The Selection of Mr. Hambro to the Presidency of this Assembly in this historic year is symbolic and is a reassuring sign. Is there need to extol his high capacities as a diplomat chosen by history to guide our debates?
85.	The peoples we represent expect positive decisions of us, decisions that will strengthen international peace and security and make it possible to illuminate our path everywhere in the world. Throughout the world, because of the possibilities of modern technology, problems and their repercussions might well darken our horizon. As it exists today, the world is subject to the misfortunes of conflicts, poverty and injustice. Under these conditions where shall we find the high moral principles and values necessary in order to preserve human civilization from collapse and to see to it that scientific, technical and cultural progress is a source of happiness for mankind? Our individual and collective selfishness is unfortunately very often our prime motivation, while peace can only be conceived of as a triumph over our instincts, justice as a continual quest for equity, and progress only as a continuous ongoing effort.
86.	How pleased I was to hear the President say, in his opening address on 15 September 1970:
'The ideology of national sovereignty has been an instrument for national liberation, and it remains in the minds of many the ultimate guarantee for the safeguarding of national identity and for maintaining the cultural diversity which we value. But in dealing with the problems of the future, problems which embrace and go beyond the field of political conflict, we must learn to cooperate in a new way in order to reach agreed solutions.' [1839th meeting, para. 51.]
In that address he also said that 'the world has become smaller and more interdependent'
87.	Therefore we must create in this ever-shrinking world the conditions necessary for us all to live together and flourish. Is that a dream? How many dreams have become realities? And does not mankind need lofty dreams in order to transcend itself and draw nearer to peace, greater justice and greater progress?
88.	In carrying out our task we must concentrate our attention on very difficult problems, problems which, because of their effects and because of the horizons they open to us if solved, will promote peace, justice and progress, which are the theme of our work this year and therefore are priority matters. A certain number of the items included in this session's agenda are very important the problem of peace, the future of our planet while others are routine matters to which we return year after year at each session without solving them. Our assistants and we ourselves try to consider these matters but the documentation piles up_, the procedure becomes more complicated, and the need for reform of the system has begun to be felt. Voices are raised in favor of reform of the machinery and procedures of the Assembly as well as of the ancillary bases of the system, particularly the Economic and Social Council.
89.	The Tunisian delegation has made it its duty to participate actively in any initiative for reforming the methods and procedures of the United Nations. All living bodies change. That is one of the laws of existence. Therefore, the initiative taken by Canada [A/7992 and Corr. 1] has merited the full support and sympathy of my delegation. Furthermore, we shall try within the Economic and Social Council, in which we have been participating for a year now, to contribute to an urgently needed reform. But we must stress that however urgent and effective these reforms may be, they can only facilitate our future work but they cannot solve those problems the solution of which depends on complex political factors. Political determination is at the root of any progress in our work. We must whenever necessary bear in mind that the objective of our institution, as defined by the Charter, is primarily to maintain international peace and security, to protect and promote human rights and to promote the economic and social progress of all peoples.
90.	It is therefore in the light of these objectives that we must decide on the priority to be given to the agenda items before us.
91.	Is the world better today than it was 25 years ago when the Second World War was about to end?
10
Has the United Nations accomplished its task? Have the appreciable efforts of the specialized agencies produced the results expected? Are there any signs of relaxation in the world? The SovietGerman Treaty which is so opportune and so full of promise, the independence of Bahrein, the progress of the Helsinki and Vienna negotiations as well as the Jarring negotiations which have been resumed will all these events provide better prospects for peace? All those questions require analysis and each of them is of obvious interest. But to distinguish between the essential problems and those which are less so, we must recognize that our session and our Organization can deal with only a limited number of items, for which a solution is not only urgent but in fact vital vital for the United Nations as an organization and still more vital for mankind and its future.
92.	One problem which is not on our agenda but which might well provide a severe test for international peace and security if it is not kept in check and if efforts are not made to solve it successfully, is that of VietNam.
93.	If we had understood in time the value of a solution by which the VietNamese people would have been able to exercise their rights to self-determination, war would not have devastated that country for so many years and would not have extended throughout the IndoChinese peninsula. This conflict might well involve all of SouthEast Asia with all the danger of enlarging the field of battle which this implies. Nothing at present indicates that the long-suffering people of IndoChina will soon see an end to their Calvary.
94.	If all parties at the Paris Conference were determined to end this conflict, this would suffice to restore for these people the hope of a more serene future.
95.	Our concern is even greater with respect to the Middle East conflict. Our Organization is directly concerned in this problem, whose origins go back not only to the June 1967 war but also to the resolution of 29 November 1947 [181 (11)], which created Israel. The United Nations at that time undertook a great responsibility to history. At that time this act was justified by the suffering of the Jews in Europe throughout the Second World War as a result of the nazi repression and by the desire of the Zionist movement to provide the Jewish community with a national home. Dr. Nahum Goldmann, one of the leaders of the Zionist movement, wrote in an article which was recently published in the American magazine Foreign Affairs:*
'Theodore Herzl, the author of Der Judenstaat (the Jewish State) of the Zionist movement, once said that the Zionist idea is a very simple one that all it has to do is to 'transport a people without a country to a country without a people.This formulation, like all oversimplifications, was wrong in both its premises: a large part of the Jewish people after the Emancipation was already a people with a country, and Palestine, inhabited for centuries by
the Arabs, was certainly not a country without a people.'
96.	Unfortunately it is the Arab people of Palestine who are today without a country and a good part of the Jewish people have two countries, and sometimes even two nationalities. Events of recent weeks and the fratricidal struggle in Jordan have proven this. While a large number of Palestinians are living under Israeli domination in their own country, another part of them have been living as refugees for more than 20 years and trying to organize themselves to survive until the Palestinian people can recover their legitimate rights to their country.
97.	In order to put an end to the struggle of two nationalisms fighting for Palestine Arab nationalism and Jewish nationalism and to promote reconciliation and understanding, Yassir Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Movement have proposed a solution which could well be studied. It is the formation of a democratic State in which Arabs and Jews could live as equals as in Lebanon, where Moslems and Christians have a stable balance through institutions supported by all. This solution might at first hardly seem realistic to those who could not imagine the possibility of a reconciliation between Arabs and Jews, but it has the merit of providing possibilities for discussion, provided the Israeli leaders cease to see in the Palestinians merely an object for their domination. Israel, by viewing itself as a theocracy, does not accept the intermingling of people of different religions. Everything it offers to the region is a series of aggressions: the war of 1948, those of 1956 and 1967, and expansionism at the expense of the countries of the Middle East.
98.	The Palestinian problem which opposes two nationalisms has developed and become more complex, since today Israel and all the Arab countries are facing each other. The generous movement of the latter since 1948 to assist their Palestinian brothers who have been victims of Zionist aggression is not only distorted by all sorts of propaganda but has also become a source of problems for all Arab countries, particularly for those a part of whose territories is occupied after an armed aggression contrary to Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations which created Israel and which Israel, like every other Member State and even more so, should obey that very Israel which from the very outset overstepped the borders assigned to it under the 1947 resolution on partition.
99.	Today while the Israeli troops are occupying the Golan Heights, the West Bank and Jerusalem itself which has been the subject of special resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and in the Security Council Gaza, Sinai, the east bank of the Suez Canal and Sharm-El-Sheikh, Israel armed to the teeth and enjoying a frequently repeated guarantee from the great Powers, claims that its main concern is to achieve a peace treaty guaranteeing it secure frontiers. But who is the victim in the Middle East? Whose frontiers, whose life, whose property and whose existence is threatened? Is it Tel Aviv or is it Ismailia and Suez which have been destroyed? Doesn't Israel know that it cannot survive unless it accepts its neighboring countries? And is the best way to do this aggression, occupation and disregard of the rights of the Palestinians?
100.	Resolution 242 (1967) of the Security Council was accepted by the parties as a basis for an equitable solution. The Security Council did indeed accomplish its task on the evening of 22 November 1967. Technically, it carried out its functions. Although that resolution is a useful document, it is the fruit of compromise. It is vague. It reveals weakness and even human cunning because the four Powers tried after very long inconclusive negotiations to provide an acceptable interpretation of it and to pinpoint certain points of agreement which would enable Ambassador Jarring to make progress. The Rogers plan has reactivated this mission which is still encountering great difficulties. However, we must warn all parties concerned in the Jarring mission against any attempt to solve the Middle East crisis without taking into account the essential factor: the fate of the Palestinian people. Any solution which did not take this factor into account would, in the view of my country, be imperfect and fraught with danger for the future.
101.	I should like to recall here the speech made by the President of the Tunisian Republic, Habib Bour-guiba, in this hall on 20 May 1968. Speaking of a solution to the Middle East problem, he stated: 'In any case, whatever this solution may be, it can only be conceivable with the participation and support of the principal party concerned, the Palestinian people.' [1658th meeting, para. 15.] The problem which is still at hand is becoming ever more complicated. Once again we must observe that a problem which is not solved adequately at the first phase of its evolution may become more complex.
102.	The efforts of the Big Four in this area would, in our opinion, become more fruitful if they were more insistent. Each Member of the United Nations has its share of responsibility in this matter, although the responsibility of some is greater than that of others. In any case, the time has come for Israel to abide by the Charter and the decisions of the United Nations. The time has come for the international community to realize that the Palestinian problem is not a refugee problem. For its part Tunisia has always viewed those matters from that standpoint. It is this position which, after the events in Jordan, has guided my country in its recent efforts for peace. In the present crisis the concern of Tunisia is to contribute to the restoration of conditions of peace and brotherhood between Jordan and the Palestinian community, thereby permitting the restoration of peace in the area. But, once again, in the view of my Government, that task falls on all peace loving countries and the Big Four in particular.
103.	Israel is not the only country to defy international morality! Twenty-five years after the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations and 10 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples millions of human beings are still living under the yoke of colonialism, particularly in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). Portugal, enjoying certain covert support, maintains its domination over those Territories on the pretext that they are overseas provinces of the metropolitan country. That is an anachronistic argument which does not stand up to objective analysis. Liberation movements are endeavoring to shake off the yoke of that colonial Power. The struggle of our brothers sometimes becomes an armed struggle. Resolutions on the subject are certainly not lacking nor is international sympathy. History, however, seems to be marking time with respect to the Portuguese colonies. Confrontation seems to have reached a dead-end between anti-colonialist movements in the world and the forces of colonialism. We in the newly independent countries are worried. Should Portugal succeed in maintaining itself by colonial domination in Africa might not the colonialist and reactionary forces seek to reorganize, to regain influence and even to rebuild new colonial empires? Thus the struggle against Portuguese domination is a primary duty for all of us who believe in the United Nations Charter, in human rights and in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.
104.	Colonialism has been a source of misfortune for a great segment of mankind. All efforts should be mobilized to liberate the Territories that are still dependent. Of course, our Organization has recognized the legitimacy of the liberation movements. It has made an appeal to the specialized agencies to assist the peoples in Territories still under domination. Our action in this field must be strengthened. It is regrettable that Portugal, which claims to follow a policy of racial integration, is joining forces with the Pretoria and Salisbury regimes which have been condemned by our Organization on many occasions, the former for its policy of apartheid and the latter for its illegal domination of the African majority in Rhodesia.
105.	In Namibia the United Nations has shown itself to be impotent because it lacked the strength to impose legality. We are of course against the use of force between States. But a people which has no other alternative than armed resistance to defend itself, and the United Nations which utilizes adequate security forces to ensure respect for universal decisions, cannot be included under the prohibition of the use of armed force.
106.	What the people still under the colonial yoke must do is to organize themselves effectively and pay the necessary price to obtain their liberation. There was a time when peoples fought for independence and liberation without outside help. We must pay a just tribute to the United Nations which has adapted itself to the peremptory requirements of decolonization. It cannot be said that the struggle of countries still under colonial domination is not supported by the international conscience. All that needs to be done is to bolster that support by practical measures, particularly through the specialized agencies. Action by those agencies could help to reduce the sufferings of the colonial peoples, reduce recourse to violence and prepare for the necessary reconciliation between the men who 12
are temporarily on opposing sides in the struggle. The message of the United Nations must be one of cooperation in dignity. Namibia is doubtless one of there difficult tests for the United Nations.
107.	When our Organization is strengthened by the admission of the People's Republic of China and other countries which are not yet represented here it may perhaps be in a position to use more effective measures to force South Africa to respect the decisions of the international community.
108.	The consideration of historical necessities should guide the international community in its attitude toward China which is still debarred from participation in the affairs of the United Nations.
109.	Densely populated, powerful and sure of itself and its right to participate in the settlement of the world's problems, China exists in the political sense and it demonstrates this every day. Hence, no useful purpose can be served by continuing an ostrich-like policy. The rights of China are more than legitimate, they are natural; that is to say, they are embodied in the very nature of its power and rank. Naturally, it is for the United Nations to study the best formula for admitting within the framework of the international community this immense country which would be called upon to carry its share of world responsibility and to show itself to be equal to the hopes of the peoples.
110.	Peace and justice, the solution of thorny problems, decolonization, the strengthening of the United Nations by the application of the principle of universality, peace and international security will these objectives be guaranteed and will mankind finally reach the universal peace which it has so ardently longed for?
111.	The authors of the United Nations Charter foresaw the importance of economic, social and human factors in strengthening peace. The Economic and Social Council was created f r this purpose. The task of the Council and the ro. x has played and must continue to play in United Nations action is an essential one. All the agencies that emerged from its deliberations are proof of its importance. With the launching of the Second United Nations Development Decade the role of the Economic and Social Council is indeed very important. But it is also important for our Assembly to adopt a strategy for this Decade. Behind the scenes negotiations are doubtless under way in the Second Committee, but we the developing countries are very often faced with incomprehension and if not the remote interests at least the immediate interests of a certain number of Powers, and sometimes with concepts hardly in accordance with our evermore urgent desire to promote development and progress.
112.	We are indeed aware that the responsibility for development falls primarily on those countries which wish to overcome the gap separating them from the rich countries. But the latter, acting also from a sense of justice, or at least from a sense of realism, and in order to maintain world peace, must also contribute substantially to this grandiose effort of raising the standard of living of three fifths of mankind.
113.	During the first Decade a praiseworthy effort was undertaken by the developed countries to assist the new countries that had just emerged from colonial domination, either through bilateral assistance or through the intermediary of the UNDP, and I should like to stress the effective action taken by that body, as well as by the world Bank, which gives much assistance to several of our countries.
114.	During that first Decade, diverse machinery was set up to facilitate cooperation between the developing and the developed countries. We could cite in this connexion the work done by the UNCTAD Conference, as well as by UNIDO.
115.	Thanks to those organs and to the practical experience they have acquired, the problems of underdevelopment have now been pinpointed and their solution made clear in many cases. The guidelines of a bold plan of action sought by Dr. Prebisch after the New Delhi Conference  are outlined in the international development strategy that has been prepared by the Preparatory Committee for the Second United Nations Development Decade [A/7982, para. 16], and have been transmitted to our Assembly with many recommendations and statements by the Economic and Social Council. Long discussions at the forty-ninth session led to greater clarifications of the positions of the various parties, although the desired agreement was not reached.
116.	The Tunisian delegation is anxious to see our Assembly adopt a draft strategy for the Second Development Decade which would confirm the determination of the United Nations to create the necessary conditions for a more equitable distribution, based on the necessary sacrifices and efforts, of development possibilities that would enable our peoples to live in harmony, safe from privation and poverty.
117.	It is ever more inadmissible to countenance the perpetuation of the coexistence of two parallel worlds: one, a rich world in which 40 per cent of the earth's inhabitants share 88 per cent of the combined gross national products, while the other, a poor world, torn by hunger, poverty and ignorance is a world in which 60 per cent of the earth's population benefits only from the remaining 12 per cent of the gross national products.
118.	Moreover, the share of the developing countries in world exports decreased by 15 per cent between 1960 and 1969, and we may well expect this trend to continue i: near future. During that same Decade we have no tea a very serious reduction in that portion of the gross national product of the rich countries allocated to feeding the economies of the underdeveloped countries. That sum has been estimated by UNCTAD to be 0.67 per cent of the gross national products of the developed countries, which was the lowest proportion ever recorded up to that time.
119.	Fortunately, the UNCTAD study, from which we have quoted these figures, also states that the First Development Decade was not a complete failure, since it recognized that the poor countries would probably reach and even exceed the target growth rate of 5 per cent, although the distribution might be unequal amongst them. In order that such progress be strengthened and that further progress be made in the course of the Second Decade, it is. essential to reach agreement on a draft strategy which would make it possible to look to the future with more confidence.
120.	When we speak of assistance we always call to mind the reluctance of certain countries in this respect, and the sometimes understandable difficulties which they invoke when asked to make a still greater effort.
121.	We also recall the problem of disarmament, which, if solved, would make it possible to earmark very great financial resources to assist the developing countries and help them exploit possibilities created by modern technology, in promoting more rapid development and thereby ensuring lasting peace among nations.
122.	There is still another problem facing the United Nations, which has been the subject of very lengthy discussions. It is indeed our duty to stress with satisfaction the progress that has been recorded in this area and to reaffirm the desire of our peoples to see the possibilities for peace improved, thanks to better understanding of the ways of destroying conventional as well as nuclear armaments. History provides opportunities for men to distinguish themselves by means other than war: the fight for prosperity, progress and the conquest of space will offer poets subjects as inspiring as the battlefield. The struggle against pollution, the conquest of the sea. the exploitation of the seabed, the defense of human rights, and the development of man's capacities all these offer bold and fascinating subjects to challenge the imagination of anyone willing to undertake such efforts.
123.	Must we revise the United Nations Charter in order to accomplish our task in this Twenty-fifth anniversary year in order to solve the urgent problems that I have mentioned and to take up the study of the various problems confronting us?
124.	The Tunisian delegation does not reject a priori the idea of participating in a study of item 88 of our agenda without considering it as an urgent or priority matter. An exchange of views on that matter might lead to some useful formula. However, it is not the Charter which prevents us from taking decisions on the Middle East problem, on the fate of countries still under colonial domination, on the strategy for the Second Development Decade, or on any other point which requires an appropriate and urgent solution   and I stress the word 'urgent'.
125.	It is for us to fulfill our duty as it is for the peoples we represent here, and our Governments, to coordinate their efforts and facilitate our mission through political decisions so that one day we may be able to hand over in worthy fashion the torch of the United Nations to the younger generation, which, confused by our own inability to resolve our conflicts and to take effective decisions in this changing world, might well refuse to accept the extinguished torch from our trembling hands.




"
25,1970,CAN,"
The General Assembly is fortunate indeed to have as its President, in this year of anniversary, a distinguished citizen of Norway, a country that gave the United Nations its first Secretary General and has always made a constructive contribution to our work here. As the General Assembly knows, our President is a member of a family that for half a century or more has played an active part in international organizations. I wish you well, Mr. President, in your new responsibilities and assure you of the active support of the Canadian delegation.
35.	I would also like to congratulate the retiring President, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph, who fulfilled her responsibilities with grace and distinction, bringing to her task long experience at the United Nations and special knowledge of the African questions which occupied so much of our attention during her year of office.
36.	Only a few weeks ago, the ceasefire in the Middle East and the proposals for negotiations to settle the conflict there gave cause for some cautious optimism. Today we are faced with a deadly serious situation in the Kingdom of Jordan, a situation which has already manifested itself in new violence and bloodshed. The struggle between forces within Jordan threatens to involve neighboring countries and there is a constant risk of widening conflict involving more distant Powers. In the course of these events we have seen new dimensions added to what is already a growing threat to world order. I refer to acts of air piracy. In the Middle East a significant new dimension is the holding of innocent people hostage for ransom for political and other purposes, one of these being to compound the difficulties already surrounding the ceasefire.
37.	No Government in the world today can fail to be concerned about the farreaching implications of this kind of international lawlessness. It is my strong conviction, and the strong conviction of my Government also, that legal and technical arrangements such as those being discussed in the International Civil Aviation Organization, necessary as they are, cannot produce the whole solution. Air hijacking must come to be regarded as abhorrent, never to be condoned or justified, regardless of the motives of the hijackers.
38.	Even without these new complications the peace talks in the Middle East are stalled because of substantial charges and counter-charges of ceasefire violations. The parties and the sponsoring Powers that brought about the ceasefire must be aware of the dangers implicit in this situation of deadlock and deterioration.
39.	I believe that the United Nations is on trial in the face of an obvious threat to the peace in the Middle East. This means that all of us, the Member nations, are on trial. If we are to meet this challenge we must stand behind and support the efforts Ambassador Gun nar Jarring and others are making to bring peace to that troubled area.
40.	If the Middle East conflict, with all its new dimensions, were the only threat facing the world, that would be sufficient to occupy fully the energies, imagination and resources of the world community. But in other parts of the world th re are formidable obstacles to peace and security.
41.	We have found no answers to the continuing race conflict in southern Africa. It continues to smolder more and more dangerously and if nothing is done might end in a conflagration engulfing the southern half of the continent.
42.	In IndoChina, war burns with varying degrees of intensity while the talks Paris show little sign of coming to grips with the real issues.
43.	Europe remains divided but there have been some encouraging developments. We can be thankful that deteriorating situations in other parts of the world have not been used to impede the movement toward the relaxation of tension between the superPowers. The strategic arms limitation talks continue, rapprochement between West Germany and the Soviet Union has been taking places, and similar improvements are foreshadowed.
44.	While international conflicts, and especially outbreaks of violence, of necessity occupy the attention of many Member Governments, they must not be allowed to overshadow equally important developments of concern to the entire world community.
45.	Developing nations see a crisis in the international development programme. Canada shares their concern and is making an increasing contribution.
46.	Environmental issues are looming larger each day. The United Nations, I am happy to say, is responding. Canada has made available the services of a distinguished public servant, Mr. Maurice Strong, to be SecretaryGeneral of the 1972 conference .
47.	All around the globe nations are in a state of uncertainty about the economic outlook.
48.	World prosperity and world security are indivisible and depend upon the strength of the world economy. Over the years the United Nations has set up partly in anticipation of needs, partly in response to demands a large and impressive family of intergovernmental bodies and other international instruments for strengthening cooperation in important fields such as finance, trade, and economic and social activity. Their contributions to better world conditions rank high on the record of United Nations achievement. The continuing need is to keep them effective.
49.	In my speech on behalf of Canada last year [1769th meeting], I drew attention to the need for renewal of the United Nations. Events in the past twelve months, some of which I have spoken of, have brought a new sense of urgency to this need. Procedural improvements can help, and I will have something to say about this in a few moments. They cannot in themselves meet the need.
50.	In its work for mankind the United Nations is today facing new threats, new constraints and new obstacles. The very assumptions upon which the Organization operates must be reexamined if the aims of the Charter are to be advanced. This advance will depend on the readiness of Members to exploit opportunities, to bring new attitudes to bear and to set practical objectives for the Organization.
51.	The Canadian delegation believes that in this year of anniversary we should seek practical ways of improving the United Nations capacity for converting common purpose into common action. It is ever more difficult for this Assembly to cope with the number and complexity of international programs and projects it has set in motion. Important work is often postponed or left incomplete. This compounds organizational and administrative problems and imposes additional expenses, burdens and obligations .
52.	This is the time, in our opinion, to follow up the improvements in the Second Committee last year and, rather than proceeding piecemeal, to take a comprehensive look at the General Assembly's procedures and organization. This is neither an original nor a new idea, but at this quarter-century mark in United Nations history we in this Assembly face again the task of self improvement.
53.	It was this belief that led my Government, with the support of twelve countries, to request the inclusion in the agenda of an item for consideration by the Assembly entitled 'Rationalization of the procedures and organization of the General Assembly'. This proposal [A17992 and Corr.l], which will have a number of additional cosponsors from various regions, envisages the establishment of a committee with equitable representation from all groups.
54.	The committee would report its findings and recommendations to the General Assembly at its next session, thus allowing the committee time to give thorough study to the problems before it. My delegation has in mind that any reforms to be effective, must attract the widest possible support and be based on a consensus to be endorsed by the Assembly, hopefully at the next session.
55.	In terms of the material and operations to be studied, the committee's mandate should be wide. This study would take into account the nature of the Assembly's work, its priorities and organization and the effectiveness of its machinery. At the same time, the committee's mandate should be narrow in that it would restrict its recommendations to the procedure and organization of the Assembly as envisaged within the limits of the Charter.
56.	Our proposal is a modest one, but I believe that even limited changes could have a very beneficial effect on our working methods and on the results achieved. Areas to be studied would obviously include documentation, rules of procedure and related questions. The proposed committee would also study the ways in which items are allocated to the main committees of the Assembly, Recommendations would take into account the need to ensure that all important political items were properly placed and adequately considered in future Assemblies.
57.	The effectiveness of the General Assembly and the United Nations will always depend upon the will and determination of the Member States. Changes in procedure and organization cannot of themselves improve the quality of the General Assembly's performance. They can enable the will of the Assembly to be translated into action more swiftly, accurately and effectively. We should not underrate such improvements, and the Canadian delegation does not.
58.	There is no need to call into question the basic structure of ti>e Organization. But the fact that we do not wish to rebuild the house does not mean that we should delay essential repairs to the plumbing and the wiring. For this reason I call upon Member States to give urgent and continuing attention to the essential detailed work that is required, without losing sight of the fundamental need for all of us to reexamine our own attitudes to our responsibilities under the Charter.
59.	The relevance and the competence of the United Nations are being called into question all over the world. The world community needs the United Nations. It needs a United Nations that has renewed itself, that has transformed itself from an arena in which Governments jostle for transient political advantage into a place of action where issues are faced, solutions are found and problems resolved. Such a United Nations would do more than serve the ambitions of member Governments, it would begin to meet the needs of the peoples of the world in whose name the Charter was proclaimed. Canada's faith in the United Nations ideal is unimpaired, and we will continue to work with others to strengthen and renew this great body upon which so many of man's hopes are fixed.


"
25,1970,PHL,"
36.	 May I say to the delegation of Malaysia that the Philippine delegation shares in its grief at the passing of one of its members, Ambassador Ramani, an able and distinguished diplomat. On behalf of my delegation I extend to Malaysia our heartfelt condolences.
37.	Permit me first of all to conform with tradition. I congratulate the Assembly for having wisely elected as President of this historic session a distinguished representative of the country which gave the United Nations its first SecretaryGeneral. To you, Mr. President, I offer my cordial felicitations and the assurance of the same unstinting cooperation which my delegation gave to your able predecessor, Mrs. Angie Brooks Randolph of Liberia.
38.	As we launch the Second United Nations Development Decade and confront the challenge of the 1970s, you have a tower of strength at your side in the person of SecretaryGeneral U Thant, a man of outstanding ability and incorruptible integrity.
39.	Now, permit me to break with tradition. The full text of my policy statement, which would have taken at least thirty minutes to deliver, has been distributed and will be circulated subsequently as an addendum to the verbatim record of this meeting.  What I shall now deliver is a ten-minute summary of that policy statement.
40.	The Secretariat has agreed to the following arrangements: that the full text of the statement to be inserted in the addendum of the record of these proceedings is not to exceed ten typewritten pages, single spaced, and that the reading time of the full text, if delivered, is not to exceed thirty minutes; and that in order that there shall be no abridgment of the right of reply, the full text of the statement must be circulated to all delegations twelve hours before delivery which we have done and on the day of delivery the full text will be again circulated to each delegation in the General Assembly. Again I repeat, the full text will be subsequently circulated as an addendum to the verbatim record of this meeting.
41.	I hope that this innovation will not only save time and expense but help make future general debates more relevant and more meaningful.
42.	.Now for the position of the Philippine delegation on the various questions facing the General Assembly. My delegation urgently reiterates the Philippine proposal, first broached in 1955, that a fundamental review of the United Nations Charter be undertaken in accordance with Article 109.
43.	At the very least, we should decide during this twenty-fifth anniversary session to form a preparatory committee for the review of the Charter, with terms of reference covering the three main areas of constitutional changes which my delegation outlined to the Assembly last year [1760th meeting],
44.	A paramount aim should be so to strengthen the peacemaking capacity of the United Nations that it could defuse the threat of renewed war in the Middle East, mediate actively to put an honorable end to the war in VietNam, and play a central role in the crucial issue of disarmament and nuclear arms control which affects not only the security but the survival of mankind.
45.	Deeply concerned at the breakdown in law and order implicit in the hijacking of civilian aircraft, my delegation is cosponsoring a new agenda item to enable the Assembly to consider effective means of countering this new form of international piracy. Our proposal is motivated by humanitarian reasons and has no political or ideological motivations.
46.	We give our full support to the suggestion that all Member States should voluntarily accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. Again we appeal to the Government of Malaysia, our good friends of Malaysia, to agree to have the Philippine aim to Sabah adjudicated by the Court. We have a high regard for the new Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Abdul Razak, and we hope he will cooperate in having this question settled once and for all in a manner worthy of our two countries' friendly relations and our membership in the United Nations.
47.	While hoping that our big neighbor, Communist China, will eventually merit membership in accordance with the Charter, we shall maintain our opposition, which is not permanent, to its admission so long as it shows no desire to join the United Nations and abide by its rules.
48.	We deplore the lag in the promotion of human rights and in the process of decolonization.
49.	We share the deepening concern over the pollution of our environment and protest the use of the Pacific Ocean for nuclear tests that could disturb its complex and delicate ecological balances.
50.	My delegation will support intensified United Nations action to extend assistance for family planning and population control to Governments which request such aid. We favor the establishment of a subregional population center in SouthEast Asia with international support.
51.	The fulfillment of youth's legitimate aspirations is of special interest to my delegation. We would welcome United Nations action for greater participation of youth in international affairs.
52.	We subscribe to the integrated, unified approach taking equal account of the economic and social factors in national development, and would like to see this concept fully reflected in the strategy and programs of the Second United Nations Development Decade. Insufficient attention to the social factor was one of the causes of the failure of the first Development Decade. We do not wish to see that mistake repeated.
53.	On the whole, my delegation finds the international development strategy drafted by the Preparatory Committee for the Second United Nations Development Decade [A 17982, para. 16] worthy of commendation and support. However, it is weakened by reservations on matters indispensable to the success of the Decade, such as the amount of resources to be transferred by the rich to the poor countries, target dates for easing onerous terms of aid, and effective measures to eliminate trade barriers and give developing countries wider access to markets in industrialized countries.
54.	I would appeal to the delegations concerned to withdraw these reservations as a token of that decisive commitment without which the Second Development Decade, like the first, would be doomed to failure. In my judgment, this is one failure the United Nations cannot afford. We have reached a fateful juncture in our affairs. The phrase 'time is running out' is no longer a figure of speech, but the literal truth.
55.	I have described the 1970s as a dangerous decade because there is danger of international respect for human rights becoming unenforceable, of the poverty gap becoming unbridgeable, and of the nuclear arms race becoming uncontrollable.
56.	Consider the gravity of our predicament.
57.	In the matter of survival: with more devastating weapons of mass destruction being produced and no system of effective controls in sight, mankind is much closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation by accident, by miscalculation, by a lapse of intelligence or will, or by suicidal folly. Never in history has the survival of humanity hung on such a very thin thread.
58.	In the matter of living space: population pressure is reducing drastically our room for maneuver in solving economic and social problems within nations and in the world at large. It threatens to impose unbreakable strains on the capacity of our planet to sustain human life in reasonable order, decency and dignity.
59.	In the matter of bridging the poverty gap: this problem constitutes the most important longterm challenge to the United Nations.
60.	As President McNamara of the World Bank has pointed out very recently:
'Twothirds of mankind more than 2,000 million individuals remain entrapped in the grip of hunger and malnutrition; high illiteracy, inadequate education; shrinking opportunity; and corrosive poverty. The gap between the rich and poor nations is no longer a gap, it is a chasm. . .
'This appalling fact transcends in importance and gravity all other social and economic problems of this century. Much of world civilization for the future will be significantly influenced by how we manage this problem.'
61.	He added population explosion to widespread poverty as another major factor in the grim equation of spiraling social unrest. He called attention to the social and political crisis which grows with each decade and threatens to round off this century with years of unrest and turbulence: a time of trouble during which the forces of historical change threaten to disintegrate our frail twentieth century society.
62.	This prophecy recalls our able Secretary General's warning that we have only ten years in which to subordinate our ancient quarrels and launch a global partnership to curb the arms race, improve the human environment, defuse the population explosion, and supply the required momentum to world development.
63.	It all adds up to a challenge of unprecedented magnitude to the United Nations and the world community. It is a challenge that could make or break our Organization. The United Nations will have to acquire the capacity to cope with the overriding problems of peace, international order and human survival or lapse into permanent ineptitude and insignificance,
64.	Last May a conference on human survival, held here in the United Nations, noted our dangerous drift 8
towards chaos and disaster. The conferees refused to despair but only if the United Nations were to be permitted to develop its full potential in meeting common dangers and common needs.
65.	Full development of the United Nations that would indeed appear to be the only answer.
66.	It would mean giving the United Nations adequate peacekeeping powers, sufficient authority to direct a concerted international effort to preserve our life sustaining environment, and the means needed to implement a truly global development strategy. It would entail surrendering to the United Nations a larger measure of sovereignty than Member States have been willing to relinquish so far, and the acceptance by them of an allegiance to humanity superior to narrow racial or national loyalties.
67.	For, indeed, if the human race is to survive, the human interest must be placed above the national interest, and the natural and essential agency for advancing the human interest in this, our United Nations.
68.	It is admittedly a revolutionary concept but I ask: will anything less suffice? It is what our threatened world needs and what the world's troubled peoples, particularly the youth, are anxiously seeking and awaiting.
69.	They want a peaceful world in which they can have a future unclouded by the threat of nuclear extinction. They want a new international order firmly founded on justice and law. And they want progress, not only for a select few but for all the members of the human family. That is what is expected of us, of this United Nations, if it is to survive.





"
25,1970,FRA,"84.	  Within one month, when we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of this Organization, we will emphasize its merits, too often ill-appreciated, recall the services that it has always rendered in spite of all its setbacks and redefine the hopes which we still place in it as a founding Member. 'Patience,' said a famous French moralist, 'is the art of hoping'.
85.	But today, as this anniversary draws near, is it not our duty to proceed to a certain examination of our consciences without hiding any truth, without masking any reality, carefully avoiding giving lessons that we are less ready to receive and especially taking
9
for our criteria not the interest of any given country no matter how legitimate but the future, the duties and the opportunities of the international community that we claim, that we want to be?
86.	If I had hesitated to choose this path, the character of the statesmen whom we have happily chosen to preside over our work after Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph whose competence and authority all of us greatly appreciated would have been enough to suggest it to me. This statesman not only represents the moral strength of a legal tradition; the name he bears, and I say this with emotion, is associated with the history of the founding of an international community. His father, whom I knew in my youth, was twice President of the Assembly of the League of Nations and represented Norway at the San Francisco Conference, in which you yourself, Mr. President, did take part. Finally, you remind us of the indomitable courage which earned the victory over Nazism without which the very name of the United Nations would never have found expression.
87.	What qualities do we need today, if not boldness in the face of challenge, and faithfulness to the principles of the law, so that we may justify our existence, that is, in the long run and in spite of every thing, successfully to counter violence with equilibrium? I shall try neither to cover every topic nor to mention every continent, nor to define once again the attitude of my country with regard to crises which are threatening or shaking the world, but merely to reply to the question which, as we all know, as we all feel in our hearts, and as was said by all the speakers this morning, the people, all the peoples of the world, are asking themselves and asking us as the spectacular ceremonies approach next month: Why so much disappointment in the face of so much hope? Why let us speak plainly this gnawing sensation of impotence to which none of us is resigned?
88.	I will give my three answers before I justify them. None of them grant me this at least is dictated by concern, fear or resentments special to my country or to a group of countries. In mentioning them I am referring only to the principles which, a quarter of a century ago, gave birth to the Charter.
89.	In three sentences here they are: our weakness, first of all, is the void caused by the absence from among us of a large part of mankind. Our weakness, secondly, is the inadequate effort made by the most fortunate peoples in aiding the struggle of the least favored peoples against hunger, disease, stagnation; and, lastly, our weakness is the resignation to a certain division of power which, unless we take care, will perpetuate the split in the world and, under cover of opposing blocs, condemn the majority of nations which paid so dearly to win the pride of their independence to choose one hegemony or submit to it.
90.	Must we then, in the first place, take the universality of the United Nations for an illusion? What is actually an illusion is to believe that the Organization can perform its task while remaining incomplete. Our Secretary-General, to whom I wish to pay a just tribute here, has never been more worthy of his lofty function than recently when he asked us in effect: Shall we, under the pretext that the debate on the question of China has been going on for twenty years, behave as if it could go on for another twenty years?
91.	Let us consider this carefully. On the one hand, the whole world recognizes as has just been done in Oslo in particularly felicitous terms by ti.e democracies of northern Europe, whose heartening vitality I noted once again last week in Finland that only a political solution, a negotiated solution, can bring an end to the unjust, interminable drama which has bathed South-East Asia in blood. On the other hand, everybody recognizes that this political, negotiated solution requires the participation of China. Everybody deplores the fact that the United Nations cannot bring an end to a tragedy which scandalizes the conscience and common sense of the world because the majority of those whom it concerns above all are unable to bear witness here to their suffering, their ruin and their dead.
92.	However, the debate on which, in the long run, the end of this artificial state of affairs depends is postponed from one year to the next as if it were a scholastic disputation or an oratorical joust. Avoiding the issue prevents the United Nations from assuming its responsibilities and the People's Republic of China from exercising its own.
93.	The Soviet Union and we congratulate it on this has renewed its dialog with Peking. The United States, in turn, can only feel a little more, with every passing day and year, the desire to resume the dialog. If the General Assembly encouraged them either to persist or to commit themselves more resolutely to this task, it might well be that the dynamism of peace would be released in Asia. Then the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization could almost do without our speeches. It would be celebrated by the gratitude of the peoples of Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos, beloved by France, and for whom the President of the French Republic would at last no longer have to ask for justice.
94.	But it is not in Asia alone that the service of the truth presupposes the recognition of realities.
95.	The conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union  is in itself an element of detente, understanding and co-operation one of the basic steps that General de Gaulle had wanted, announced and prepared. But, at this point, we have one more reason to welcome it. It brings us closer to the day when 'the whole of Europe' that Mr. Georges Pompidou spoke about at The Hague Conference  will be present here in this Assembly. Let us not say that we are still far from this, but let us rather say that we are less far.
96.	However, when we think of the United Nations as it should be, we must not divert our attention from what it is. Now, this shows up another weakness. Of course, it is not responsible for the growing disparity between the standards of living and the conditions of existence of countries which make up this Organization. On the contrary, to its credit, it has emphasized, analyzed, sometimes revealed, this increase in iniquity. One would have to mention twenty names to pay a just tribute to the intelligence, depth and generosity of the reports and studies that have made it possible to map out the problems without hiding the difficulties. This is all to the good. And now? Well, now the time has come to harness the goodwill of States. The time has come to obtain from each one of them commitments equal to its capacities. What the preliminary work shows is that it is no longer possible to mention any real reason, any acceptable excuse, to further delay this moment.
97.	As the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development forecast last month at Geneva, the 'year 2000, without new collective efforts, will see the share of the developing countries in world exports drop to 10 per cent'. It is easy to understand that those countries cannot, without a certain bitterness, compare this prophecy with the sentence I noted in the last annual report of the World Bank: 'The work of the commission headed by Mr. Lester Pearson on joint action for the development of the third world has given rise to wide-ranging discussions in official circles.'
98.	Is there anyone here who could possibly believe that the stage of discussion even wide-ranging discussions should not be over? France recently defined the objectives of her new Plan. Figures and percentages will hardly be found in it. It is a rule of conduct which will not surprise economists. But we did make one exception: whatever the circumstances, credits devoted to aid to development will remain above 1 per cent of our gross national product. More than half of these credits will be absorbed by public aid which itself comprises more than 80 per cent in grants.
99.	Those who have been associated with the work of General de Gaulle, and, primarily, the present President of the Republic, believe that decolonization itself creates obligations. That is why and I say so weighing every word they are and expect to remain attentive to all requests which reach them from Africa. That is also why they feel authorized to say to you: may common action for the development of the third world become our mutual obsession at last.
100.	But serious as they may be, the weaknesses resulting from certain absences and a certain deficiency are at least known and, most often, admitted. No one considers that the collective effort in favor of the peoples who have the right to claim it is sufficient or satisfactory. No one can regard it as normal that a quarter of mankind is outside the United Nations. On the other hand there is a third danger of which less is said but which should be squarely faced the danger that threatens the balance of responsibilities on which the Charter, and therefore the United Nations itself, is founded. I repeat: the balance of responsibilities. It would disappear if the strongest Powers shirked their own responsibilities; it would equally be upset if they pretended to assume the responsibilities of others, or if others relinquished the responsibilities which their status as Members of the United Nations gives them. Hegemony, exclusive or shared, is the surest way of preventing the United Nations from breathing and therefore from acting.
101.	Three consequences flow from this double statement. First the dialog and rapprochement of the major Powers are desirable and beneficial. Secondly, the international community cannot have guardians. Thirdly, due to the very fact that they are immune to the temptation of guardianship, a special duty falls to the countries which, though not among the highest ranking Powers, are permanent members of the Security Council.
102.	Those three principles are fully applicable to the crisis in the Middle East. All of us welcome with relief the determination seen in the leaders of the two Powers which possess the most fearful strategic weapons to replace controversy by negotiation. As for France, we find involved, on the one hand, our oldest ally and, on the other, a great friendly country with which France has developed closer and closer bonds of co-operation. The President of the French Republic, who has surely not forgotten his reception by President Nixon, was a few months ago the guest of Washington. In a few days, he will be the guest of Moscow. When, in one of the most troubled areas of the world, the movement towards peace receives a new impetus from the dialog happily re-established between Moscow and Washington, it is only natural that we should rejoice about it. That is our first point.
103.	And here is the second. The more we consider it to be indispensable, in view of reappearing and growing threats, to do everything possible to ensure respect for the cease-fire and to do away with obstacles to negotiations, the more we see that the sharing of power or influence cannot form a basis for peace. 'If the situation is disturbing for the bordering countries', a high-level Arab official, the Foreign Minister of Tunisia, recently said, 'it is because it makes the Mediterranean one of the centers of encounter or of confrontation of the two greatest world Powers as was Europe during the fifties which means that its destiny is not completely its own'. Now is not our basic maxim precisely this: that no one, except that country itself, may decide the fate of a nation?
104.	How, then, to move away from trusteeships and guardianships, even involuntary ones, without losing the advantage of beneficial rapprochements? The third and last point gives the reply. It is necessary that recommendations be drawn up not for the advantage of one State or one ethnic group, one religion or one culture, but in order to re-establish, in a region which has already given so much to mankind, a zone of cooperation between all ethnic groups, all religions, all cultures which exist there side by side, in the respect for boundaries and the rights of all the States. It is also necessary that these recommendations be mutual. That is, far from becoming a means for one State to put pressure upon another, they should propose procedures of implementation which would be both substantial and well-balanced for all the rules laid down by the Security Council resolution [242 (1967)], whether it be a question of withdrawal from conquered lands or guarantees of peace, freedom of navigation or the rights of the Palestinian refugees.
105.	Now who can permanently defend the spirit and letter of this resolution? Who can somehow be the permanent representative of the international community, if not precisely the whole formed by the perma-nent members of the Security Council? 'The area of agreement between the Four is much wider than the area of disagreement', our Secretary-General rightly said at a recent press conference. At the same time he thus reminded us that the agreement of the Four is the true way to arrive at our goal without divesting the United Nations as a whole of the irreplaceable responsibilities it assumes and should continue to assume in that part of the world.
106.	Without naming them I have just mentioned two European countries, my own and the United Kingdom. It is not by chance that I link them. The Conference of The Hague, as you know, opened up a new chapter. In making public its decision to make its work irreversible, the European Economic Community showed not once but twice that it wanted to be neither exclusive nor inward-looking. It showed this first by opening itself to all European States which accept its rules and goals Britain as well as Ireland, Norway as well as Denmark, to mention only the present candidates. It showed this also by affirming that its mission prevented it from transforming itself into a bloc confronting other blocs. It is not only for itself that it wishes to be an independent center of progress and prosperity. Today, everyone can see that the building of Europe is in fact inseparable from European detente and thus from world peace.
107.	Moreover, the bonds of solidarity which, thanks to the Yaounde Conventions,  join it to Africa are only one example of the mission which a reconciled Europe can assume in the world. It is right that, from the shores of the Mediterranean to the whole of Latin America, people should turn towards that Europe and place their hopes in it. For it is known that, fortified by its own originality, it will certainly not threaten but rather encourage the independence of others.
108.	The celebration of the awe-inspiring anniversary of which I spoke at the beginning may have started last week when a wholesome and significant unanimity was reached in the Security Council [see resolution 286 (1970)] in denouncing, in the face of a new form of premeditated violence, the hijacking of aircraft as well as any other interference with international civil air travel, and reprisals against innocent people. Respect for human rights is not an obligation only for States but also for peoples;, groups, individuals and especially those who may have cause to invoke it.
109.	The same moral strength of the collective con-science should be brought to bear to find a remedy through specific steps to the inadequacy of the international protection of basic rights. One example, among so many others, comes to mind. I am thinking of those journalists on dangerous missions who have often, by their very objectivity, contributed to the freeing and liberation of unfortunate peoples and whose fearless, professional conscience has led them to an unfair death. As long ago as 1968, the International Congress of Montecatini turned to the United Nations to ensure that these indispensable witnesses should receive legal protection suitable to their mission. Our forthcoming discussions regarding respect for human rights in times of armed conflict should make it possible for us to respond to this appeal.
110.	But the protection of human rights is indivisible. It obliges every Member of the United Nations to condemn discrimination, first and foremost racial discrimination, apartheid, whatever the pretext or method. We have not forgotten the words which the President of the Federal Republic of Cameroon used in speaking about this in the General Assembly last year [1756th meeting]. He would have proved to us, had it been necessary, that respect for the Charter and concern for its effectiveness are in the long run the true means to fight for the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
111.	In truth, these principles on which our Organization is founded have lost none of their vitality and power of attraction in twenty-five years. These principles are evoked by peoples everywhere in the world to defend their independence or to obtain, at long last, the right freely to choose their destiny. These are the principles in which today's youth, restless, boisterous and demanding, is trying to find an ideal again, as quite recently the World Youth Assembly  showed us here.
112.	May so much assembled hope give us the strength to overcome our weaknesses. The enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights requires, first of all, that arms be silent. This is why, on the eve of a re-examination of our consciences, we are resolved are we not? to be worthy of the trust which people put in us, by placing more clarity, wisdom and boldness in the service of peace.



"
25,1970,TUR,"83.	 I should like to join previous speakers in extending to President Hambro my warmest congratulations on his election to the Presidency of the General Assembly. The unanimity with which the Presidency has been entrusted to him shows the great prestige he has won in the Assembly by his exceptional talents and qualities as a distinguished statesman and scholar. His constant loyalty to the cause of peace, his experience in diplomacy and his extensive knowledge of international law will be a most valuable help to this Assembly in the course of its deliberations. The President may rest assured of my delegation's full support in his difficult task.
84.	May I also be permitted on this occasion to pay tribute to the outgoing President, Mrs, Angie Brooks Randolph, who directed our work during the last session of the Assembly with the experience, wisdom and the talent known to us all.
85.	Before going on to other subjects, I should like to express my Government's satisfaction at the forthcoming accession of Fiji to membership in the United Nations. This is not only a new stage in the process of decolonization, but also brings us a little closer to our goal of universality for our Organization.
86.	The present session marks a milestone in the history of the United Nations. For this year we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of our Organization. The stage we have reached gives us an opportunity to take stock of our activities and to search our hearts in order to draw useful lessons for the future.
87.	When we look to the past, we see a great number of achievements, but also serious shortcomings. This is certainly regrettable, but it is no use ignoring realities, however unpleasant they may be.
88.	We all know that since its creation, the United Nations has not always lived up to our expectations and has not played the ambitious role assigned to it by the Charter. The numerous crises which have shaken the world and threatened peace during the past twenty-five years have often found their solutions outside the framework of the United Nations. The great challenges of our times, such as the scientific and technical revolution, the problem of youth, or the problem of the widening development gap between Member
States are not sufficiently reflected in the work of the Organization.
89.	It would be unfair to blame the Charter or the lack of material means for this situation. It is perhaps due to the excessive optimism that marked the first years of the United Nations. The effectiveness of the Organization depends, after all, on the common will of its Members. In the present state of the world, selfish considerations often take precedence over the general interest, and one cannot expect age old habits to be overcome within a period of twenty-five years.
90.	It is this, rather than anything else, that prevents our Organization from acting with the desired effectiveness and dynamism. In the circumstances it might be fairer to ask by what miracle the United Nations has been able to accomplish such considerable work in so many fields within the space of twenty-five years. The achievements to its credit are indeed numerous and varied. A host of differences have been settled through the mediation of the United Nations and through the efforts of its SecretaryGeneral or his representatives. An enormous amount of work in depth for the benefit of future generations has been done by the specialized agencies in fields as varied as health, education, agriculture, science and the training of specialists.
91.	Hundreds of international agreements have been initiated or concluded under the auspices of the United Nations and we are indebted to it for a large part of the legislation on human rights.
92.	If despite all that the United Nations continues to be criticized, it is because its foundation aroused the highest hopes. Those who conceived the Charter were inspired by the noble ideal of a better world free from fear, hunger, sickness a peaceful world in which all countries could devote their energy to the economic, social and cultural development of their peoples in an atmosphere of stability and prosperity. We are still far from that goal.
93.	In order to live up to this challenge, I think it is important above all to preserve the moral authority and the prestige of the United Nations. That is a matter of capital importance, because the greater the moral authority of the United Nations the better position it will be in to exercise a salutary influence upon those who might be tempted to violate the principles of the Charter.
94.	Unfortunately, in view of the present state of international mores, it is not enough to preach respect for principles. We must also take practical steps to ensure that they are respected. The Charter provides us with a number of means to that end; what has been lacking thus far is mainly the will to apply them.
95.	Such seems to me, in the light of past experience, the main lesson we should learn from the twenty-fifth anniversary.
96.	One important item on the agenda of the twenty- fifth session concerns the study of measures to strengthen international security. This is a many-sided problem which should be considered from both the global and the practical point of view.
97.	With regard to the first aspect, we must try first to determine the basic elements that threaten international peace and stability. Among the basic moral causes of tension, we find political ambition, conflicting ideologies and the desire for hegemony. Without wishing to be pessimistic, I believe that the elimination of such factors can be achieved only gradually, as the authority and effectiveness of the Organization are strengthened. As to the major material factor, it is the ever-widening gap between the level of development of industrialized societies and that of other countries. If this gap could be narrowed to tolerable proportions, if not eliminated, it would undoubtedly help to strengthen international peace and security.
98.	With regard to practical measures, it should first be noted that theoretically the United Nations has a complex of very effective means at its disposal, but they have not yet been applied on the right scale. Although the obstacles to their application are real enough, the means for giving them practical effect should be seriously studied. One field that offers interesting possibilities in this regard is that of peacekeeping operations. If a solution could be found for the difficulties standing in the way of an agreement, it would be a long step in this direction.
99.	Finally, structural reforms could be contemplated. But this is a delicate undertaking which requires caution and imagination, for the problem is to find an acceptable formula which would enable the United Nations to act effectively without impairing its nature of a free association of equal and sovereign nations. In the present circumstances it seems to me wiser to concentrate our priority efforts on the full application of the provisions of the Charter, which contains an ample reserve of means that can make it a highly effective instrument for the preservation of peace, provided we go about it with a will.
100.	Another subject which is directly related to the maintenance and strengthening of security is the problem of disarmament. We wholeheartedly welcome the happy initiative of the General Assembly in proclaiming the 1970s the Disarmament Decade [resolution 2602 E (XXIV)]. This problem, which concerns the very future of mankind, has been our central preoccupation for many years. This is a field in which negotiations have always been particularly slow and difficult. It is nevertheless possible to say that recently some progress has been achieved.
101.	The entry into force of the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] is indeed an important step towards nuclear disarmament. We hope that the increasing efforts to prohibit the use of chemical and biological weapons and the storing of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and the ocean floor will also lead to positive results. The best guarantee for the success of these efforts lies in the continuing interest and active participation of the General Assembly.
102.	The negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic arms have also opened new perspectives in a field of vital importance for the security of all the countries in the world. If even a partial agreement could be reached, the chances of putting an end to the frantic arms race would certainly be increased. However, we still have a long and arduous road before us in order to arrive at general and complete disarmament under effective international control. I express the hope that the forthcoming decade will be more fruitful in this respect than the preceding decades.
103.	I should like now to express the views of my Government on the various problems which continue to hold the international stage.
104.	Once again, the Middle East crisis is our main preoccupation and constitutes the major hotbed of tension endangering peace and stability. Two months ago, at a time when the prospects were dark indeed, the United States peace plan revived hopes for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. The acceptance of the ceasefire within the framework of this plan by the countries most directly concerned has halted an alarming military escalation and made possible the reactivation of the Jarring Mission. It must be admitted that the joint efforts of the United States and the Soviet Union to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, as well as the concerted efforts of the four Powers under the auspices of the United Nations, have contributed significantly to the attainment of this result. The observance and maintenance of the ceasefire are the first condition for the success of these efforts. At this delicate juncture it is indeed important that the parties should refrain from any provocation and show patience, sincerity and good faith, without retreating from the right decision they have taken. This is the only way in which the climate of mistrust which poisons the atmosphere and prevents any progress can be dispelled. The second condition is that Ambassador Jarring should be given a chance to continue the conversations with the parties to the conflict, so as to profit from the cessation of hostilities and undertake a frank gnd open discussion with them on all aspects of the problem. If these two conditions were fulfilled, the talks could proceed on the basis of the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967[242 (1967)]to try and find the elements of an agreement.
105.	I should like to reiterate here the position of my Government on the various aspects of the conflict. We continue to be firmly opposed to the use of force to gain political advantage, acquire territorial gains and impose unilateral solutions, since nothing lasting can be built on enmity and injustice. Similarly, measures to change unilaterally the status of the Holy City of Jerusalem are unacceptable whatever the reasons claimed. This change in its status in fact goes beyond the strictly regional framework and brings an emotional element into the conflict the explosive nature of which hardly ne> is to be emphasized.
106.	Our objective has always been, and still is, the establishment of a just and lasting peace that will finally bring a healthy atmosphere to the region. War brings no solution to differences; on the contrary, it only serves to complicate the situation further. The Middle East conflict is no exception to the rule. This conflict which has been going on for years has created a highly complex situation and, as in other similar cases, it leaves the usual legacy of hostility, mistrust, destruction and related problems the elimination of which will require arduous and patient effort.
107.	Nevertheless, whatever the difficulties to be overcome, we must always bear in mind that the alternative to success in this new attempt can only be a major crisis with unforeseeable consequences. In view of the seriousness of this prospect, we cannot afford a failure which world opinion would not forgive us. Neither have we the right to disappoint those who are experiencing the daily hardships of the war and to whom the ceasefire brought such welcome relief.
108.	Speaking of the Middle East conflict, one cannot pass over in silence the dramatic situation in Jordan. War is surely a dreadful thing, but I believe that civil war, which causes bloodshed among people of the same nation, sowing hatred and desolation among members of the same family, exceeds in horror anything that one can imagine. The sacred desire in the hearts of all Jordanians should be to serve their country better. My most fervent wish is to see this fratricidal struggle stop as soon as possible.
109.	I think the present circumstances provide a good opportunity to take advantage of the exceptional talents of Mr. Jarring, whose skill, discreet diplomacy and tact are universally recognized and appreciated.
110.	Before leaving the Middle East region, I should like to turn to a problem which is of still more direct concern to my country, namely, the question of Cyprus. The peculiar nature of the Republic of Cyprus, composed of two national communities and based on the equality of rights of the two ethnic entities and on their proportional participation at all levels of political activity, is enshrined in constitutional and contractual provisions.
111.	The main objective of the talks going on between the two communities of Cyprus is to explore the possibility of a return to constitutionality and the restoration of normal conditions. These talks, which have been going on since June 1968, have not thus far led to an agreement between the island's two communities.
112.	Despite fading hopes, we still look forward to the day when the door will open to a just and equitable solution, safeguarding the independence of Cyprus and the rights and interests of the two communities within the framework of the balance established, recognized and respected at the inception of the Stace.
113.	I should like once again to thank the Secretary General, his special representative and the authorities of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus for the interest they have shown in the situation in the island, particularly during a period when certain destructive trends and lack of security further complicated the situation and prevented an agreement between the two communities.
114.	I should also like to say a few words about a conflict which continues to be a source of danger to peace, that is, the VietNam war. This war, which has already cost innumerable lives and sown destruction throughout the countries of the region, has not yet been brought to an end despite President Nixon's decision gradually to withdraw United States forces from VietNam and despite the continuation of the Paris talks. So long as the conflict continues the danger of its extension to neighboring areas cannot be eliminated. We sincerely hope that a solution will be found within the framework of the Geneva Agreements of 1954, and that the brave and unfortunate people of that region will at last be able to decide their own future freely.
115.	When we look towards Europe, we see that in that continent at least the efforts towards detente are beginning to yield fruit. The gradual improvement of the political climate which started last year is actively continuing. There are now contacts and continued discussions going on among the countries concerned, including the United States and Canada, so as to establish the principles on which the strengthening of European security might be based. Thanks to these contacts, the respective positions have been clarified on many points.
116.	However, the division of Europe into two blocs, the presence on the continent of substantial military forces, and conflicting views on fundamental problems make it no easy task to eliminate the points of disagreement. The successive setbacks of the postwar years have taught us caution. In order to avoid new disappointments, the process of detente should be pursued progressively and without unnecessary haste. We also need time in order gradually to dispel the lack of mutual trust which is the legacy of the cold war.
117.	The recent Treaty signed between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union represents an important step in this respect which, we hope, will be followed by other agreements, thus one by one eliminating the sources of tension.
118.	The prospects for convening a conference on European security fall in this context. If progress as promising as that registered to date is achieved in the near future, the way to a real detente and fruitful cooperation among all the countries of the continent will at last be clear.
119.	This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which undoubtedly constitutes one of the most important documents adopted by our Organization, a document of which Turkey was a cosponsor. Since the adoption of that historic Declaration, twenty-six countries have acceded to independence. This is due in large part to the incessant efforts of our Organization, and more particularly to the remarkable work of the Committee of twenty-Four.
120.	Although the progress achieved during the past decade is remarkable, we have not yet succeeded in completely eliminating this anachronism, which persists mainly in the southern part of the African continent.
121.	Those who try to prevent the application of measures adopted to help the enslaved peoples fighting for their most natural rights are pursuing an aim as repugnant as it is futile. This is an intolerable attitude. I once again strongly condemn the policy of apartheid. Despite all the appeals, that inhuman policy continues to be applied. The South African Government disregards with equal intransigence the Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on Namibia terminating the mandate, and is extending its regime of apartheid to that country as well.
122.	As an active member of the United Nations Council for Namibia since its inception, Turkey would like here to express its satisfaction at being able to report some progress on this question. The Council for Namibia has in fact begun to exercise some of its executive powers. The decision of the Security Council [resolution 284 (1970)] to seek an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice constitutes another positive action which may throw some light on the legal aspects of measures that we may be called upon to take in the future.
123.	Still on the subject of Africa, in Southern Rhodesia the illegal and inhuman minority regime continues to perpetuate another example of colonialism. My country has not recognized that regime and strictly observes the mandatory economic sanctions adopted by the Security Council for the first time in the history of the United Nations.
124.	Unfortunately, it is now clear that the mandatory economic sanctions have not succeeded, and the diplomatic and economic isolation of the illegal regime has not yielded the anticipated results. We therefore believe the Security Council should find new means of ensuring the implementation of its decisions.
125.	The twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly will be a historic turning-point for the field of economic and social cooperation. We shall be adopting the document on the international development strategy [A 17982] and inaugurating the Second Development Decade. These are closely related aspects of one and the same question.
126.	The goals and objectives of the development strategy are now being elaborated. Although the document does not seem to be as comprehensive as we would have wished after two years of intensive effort, we nevertheless hope that it will be possible on this basis to reach a general agreement in the course of the decade on political measures for the attainment of these objectives. This is a project in which we cannot afford to fail. The prosperity and welfare of two thirds of humanity depend on the success of the Second Development Decade. To the extent that we can give it real content in harmony with the goals and objectives
n
of the development strategy, so will our chance of living in a stable and peaceful world be increased.
127.	We must, however, bear in mind that it would take a hundred years to double the present average standard of living under the rate of growth proposed in the development strategy. If we take into account the extraordinary dynamism of our age, this objective may turn out to be far too modest.
128.	I should also like to say a few words about the negative developments which are taking place in the field of international trade. The share of the developing countries in international trade continues to decline. It is imperative that the measures proposed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development be implemented in order to reverse this trend.
129.	A problem which increasingly affects the lives of men is that of the human environment. We are now seeing an unprecedented population explosion. Rapid urbanization and industrialization have further complicated the problems created by this phenomenon. The exhaustion of natural resources and the pollution of our air and water are affecting the balance of nature. These are highly complex matters which ought to be dealt with on a global scale. The United Nations offers one of the best forums in which such an undertaking can be pursued. We welcome the work done by the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. My country is actively engaged in these matters and will deem it a duty to contribute to the success of the 1972 conference  and to the efforts of the United Nations in this field.
130.	Speaking of the human environment, I should like to dwell briefly on a problem which I am sure is of interest to all of us. I refer to the natural disasters which affect the lives of tens of thousands of people and cause ravages in all the countries of the world. Many countries, including my own, have been the victims of natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods, and so forth. A few months after the disaster which struck Gediz, in Anatolie, Peru had to face a similar earthquake disaster that ravaged the country and took tens of thousands of human lives. Once again I should like to express our deep sympathy with that courageous and grievously afflicted people and also with the Romanian people who have recently been the victims of disastrous floods.
131.	The human conscience quite naturally revolts against such destruction and all peoples of the world spontaneously offer whatever they can in generous assistance to the victims. The help of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in those difficult times, too, is received with gratitude by those who suffer these ordeals.
132.	I believe that the time has come to tackle this problem on a world scale and in a more systematic manner. It would be desirable to establish machinery equipped with adequate technical and financial means within the framework of the United Nations so as to make possible the rapid organization of assistance and to provide the necessary material and technical supplies to those who are in urgent need of them. In the course of this session my delegation intends to propose the inclusion of a new agenda item and a draft resolution to that effect. We shall be happy to associate ourselves with other delegations wishing to join us in this humanitarian initiative, the sole purpose of which is to ease the suffering of the countries and peoples so afflicted.
133.	In conclusion, I should like to reiterate here a hope which I had the privilege of expressing once before and which I believe deserves to be repeated, that is, the hope that we may be able to live in a better world in which all our problems will be solved. Much remains to be done to arrive at that stage. Yet I believe that despite the great number of major obstacles that remain to be overcome, we are all aware that there is a spark of hope which illuminates the road to be followed. This spark is the genius of man, which has enabled mankind to achieve such brilliant success in the field of science. The day we succeed in putting this genius at the service of peace, the main obstacle will have been overcome.
134.	I should like to conclude my statement on this hopeful note and to express my strong conviction that to hope for a better world is not an unrealizable dream, but a perfectly accessible ideal.




"
25,1970,ZAF,"1.   Mr President, my delegation has already extended to you from this rostrum its warm congratulations on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly and has assured you of its co-operation at all times. I wish to associate myself with those remarks and extend to you my personal congratulations and good wishes.
2.	This Assembly is no ordinary Assembly. It marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and is a significant milestone in the story of the international community. It is a time for looking forward and a time for looking back. We must look back at the past quarter of a century to identify the successes and failures, to examine where our procedures have been sound and where we have been misguided, to recognize where we have tried too hard and where not enough, and to assess the correctness of our priorities, emphasis and direction. The information we derive from this necessary process of introspection must be carefully weighed so as to enable us to produce a sound program for the future attention of the Organization, one that will help it to achieve its most important aims more effectively.
3.	On looking back, the unfortunate but unavoidable conclusion is that the achievements of the Organization have not matched the high hopes of its founders. A crisis of confidence has been experienced by Members and even noted by the Secretary-General. Dissatisfaction with the lack of progress by the Organization is
reflected in the call from many quarters for a revision of the Charter with a view to improving the effectiveness of the Organization as an instrument for promoting peace and international security.
4.	It is understandable that this prescription for the maladies of the Organization should appeal to some, but it seems to my Government that treatment of this kind would be misdirected; we should be attempting to cure a symptom instead of the disease. Despite its imperfections, it is not the Charter which is basically at fault, but the lack of will on the part of Members to apply it constructively. Chapter I of the Charter embodies the highest common denominator of the aspirations of the peoples of the world acting in community; but when Member States have participated in the proceedings of organs created by the Charter, they have generally acted as individuals, promoting their own or narrow sectional interests only. The rights, interests and sensitivities of other States have been relegated to a position of subordinate importance, and this has given rise to friction between nations, and the dissemination, even by the Secretariat, of political propaganda directed against Member States. This pattern of behaviour of States diverges fundamentally from the vision of the architects of San Francisco, who would 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war'. The conclusion to which we are drawn is that in order to enable the world body more effectively to fill the role it was originally designed to play in world affairs, Member States must return to the spirit of San Francisco. My Government believes that this is the first essential step towards restoring the authority and prestige of the United Nations. The second is that States should honor the letter and the spirit of the existing Charter, being guided by the broadly defined purposes and principles set out in Chapter I.
5.	It has been said, increasingly of late, that the United Nations is merely a mirror of the realities of the existing world situation. There is no disputing that. Nations tend to reach decisions, and act, outside the framework of the United Nations, according to the dictates of self-interest, and then to seek to justify their actions in this forum, or, alternatively, to find a scapegoat to divert attention. In that way Member States have tended to neglect their individual responsibilities.
6.	By signing the Charter, Member States undertook, for instance, to strive for the creation of the conditions of stability and well-being which are essential for peaceful and friendly relations among nations. Article 55 of the Charter deals with that aspect. The creation of these conditions is a responsibility which falls
primarily within the sphere of action of individual States, which should ardently pursue the goals of economic and social development and the well-being of their own peoples. Signatories of the Charter, however, have also committed themselves to act, in their relations with one another, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter, and they have thereby accepted a responsibility vis-a-vis other States and their peoples. Membership has, therefore, brought with it both domestic and international obligations.
7.	It is the appropriate time for Members to take stock of their domestic and international achievements, measured against the standard of the Charter. I am not suggesting that the United Nations should take upon itself the task of weighing up the achievements and/or failures of any particular State or States, a course which would be in violation of the provisions of the Charter. I am suggesting rather that Member States should themselves, in this anniversary year, in the spirit of Article 56 of the Charter, direct their inquiring scrutiny at their own achievements over the past 25 years. It is not merely the question of where they stand today that is relevant, but also of where they are today in comparison with 1945. Accordingly, States should first assess their progress domestically in the fields referred to in Article 55. They might ask themselves to what extent they have succeeded in promoting higher standards of living, full employment, conditions of economic and social progress and development and respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms among their own peoples. Secondly, they should consider whether in their behavior towards others they have acted, and are continuing to act, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter.
8.	As for my own Government, we know that much remains to be done in the future. But I am glad to say also that much has been accomplished in the past 25 years. The general advancement on all fronts of our diverse peoples has been such that their well-being in 1970 certainly exceeds the most optimistic expectations of 1945. We, therefore, are satisfied that we are making significant headway in acquitting ourselves of our commitment under Article 55 of the Charter. Let there be no doubt that we are as concerned as any other State about the realization of the objectives expressed in that Article. We are furthermore satisfied that we shall continue to make progress in the manner which is best suited to, and is dictated by, 'the particular circumstances' existing in the area under our jurisdiction to borrow a phrase from Article 73 of the Charter.
9.	Article 55 emphasizes respect for the right of self- determination of peoples. This does not mean that in multinational countries or groupings, one group or nation which happens to be in the majority should be allowed, in the exercise of its right of self- determination, to deprive other numerically smaller nations of the same right. Accordingly, in the exercise of self-determination in such multinational countries, the history and diversity of the peoples living there should be taken fully into account.
10.	South Africa is a multinational country. Our population does not consist of only two elements, a black nation and a white nation. It is composed, in fact, of a white nation and several non-white nations or peoples and the distinction between them is based on the fact that their language, culture, history and traditions differ from one another as markedly as day does from night. In other words the distinction is not based solely on race or colour. We believe that in applying the principle of self-determination, the rights of each of these nations should be preserved. Since 1948, when it first came to power, my Government has actively promoted self-determination for those of our peoples not yet enjoying it, on this basis.
11.	Today all peoples in South Africa possess self- government in varying forms and at various levels of development. Most of our black African peoples, for instance, already have their own legislative and executive assemblies, or councils, with the necessary administrative departments. The Xhosa people of the Transkei were the first to receive a modern parliament and their own Government after their first general election was held in 1963. During the past two years no fewer than eight new territorial Governments have been established with their own legislative and executive councils and with approximately 50 state departments already under their control. In this process of evolution towards independence the peoples of each of these territories have acquired a representative and responsible Government which is actively engaged in planning their own future and preparing them for independence in co-operation with the South African Government, in a peaceful and orderly manner.
12.	On the 15th of last month, in the South African Parliament, my Prime Minister restated government policy in that respect. He reaffirmed that our policy does not constitute a denial of human dignity and added that while he claimed for himself the right of maintaining his identity as a white person, he also conceded to every non-white nation living in South Africa the right to its own identity. He continued as follows:
'Here in South Africa a Bantu person has never got into trouble for having requested and demanded self-determination for his people. Quite the contrary! We are in fact guiding them along the road to self- determination; we are in fact preparing them for self- determination; we are in the process of training them and making them and their land receptive to self- determination. If honorable members or the outside world ask me when it will happen that they go their own way, I can merely reply once again that this Parliament has passed certain legislation and that any black nation is at liberty to come to this Parliament and say that the time has arrived for it to go its own way. This Government, or whatever other Government may be in power, will deliberate and negotiate with that nation.
'I want to make the principle very clear: if there is a desire to hold discussions, we shall be obliged and ready to enter into such discussions. It stands to reason that we would prefer these discussions to be deferred until greater development has taken place in those black territories so that they may be more viable and better prepared to stand on their own feet. But it is by no means my intention to make it a condition that they must be viable before they have the right to approach us. This is their inalienable right, which they can exercise tomorrow if they so desire.'
13.	After the black peoples of South Africa have attained independence we shall not desert them. We shall continue to assist them in a spirit of good neighborliness. We shall continue to co-operate with them to our mutual advantage and, in the nature of things, on a much larger scale than we are already doing in the case of our other newly independent African neighbors. In the long term this political development could lead to a commonwealth of independent peoples and States, living side by side on a basis of sovereign equality. They will continue to be inter-dependent economically, but there will be no domination of any one people or any one State by others.
14.	To the skeptics who may still refuse to believe in the feasibility or practicability of the program I have outlined perhaps because of the size and economic viability of the Territories or homelands we are leading to independence let me say this: the populations of the Territories in question range between 300,000 and 3.5 million, populations which exceed those of many States which belong to this Organization and are represented here today. Their areas, too, exceed the areas of many Members of the United Nations. The gross national income of several of those Territories compares more than favorably with that of some Member States. Moreover, South Africa itself has one of the strongest and fastest developing economies in the entire world. In the light of our economic interdependence and our commitment to regional co-operation, economic stability in southern Africa will be guaranteed and development in all fields assured.
15.	Against that background we do not believe that we can legitimately be accused of denying the peoples of South Africa the right of self-determination. As I have said, our whole policy is aimed at avoiding domination of any one people or any one State by others. It is designed to enable each nation, while maintaining its identity, to realize its own ambitions to the full. That surely is the essence of self-determination.
16.	Apart from the right of self-determination, there are other equally important basic rights. Almost three decades ago President Roosevelt outlined his four 'freedoms' which are today no less important than they were then. In those, and other fields mentioned in Article 55 of the Charter, substantial progress has been made in my country. Freedom of religion and speech, the liberty of the person, inviolability of person and property and free access to courts of impartial justice are assured. But here, too, the rights of the individual must not be exercised in such a way as to deprive others of that same right. Hence, those rights can be enjoyed only within the framework of an ordered and peaceful society. Only in such a society can high standards of living, full employment and conditions ■ of economic and educational progress and development be realized for the individual human being.
17.	Other freedoms are related to the fundamental needs of man, for example, freedom from poverty and want and the need for health, education and other social services. Freedom from poverty and want is directly related to economic advancement. It is significant in this respect that the real per capita income of South Africa rose by 66 per cent during the 20 years from 1949 to 1969. As regards other services, we have implemented an education program which will within one generation eliminate illiteracy and which provides opportunities for a university education to increasing numbers of students of all races; we have opened up avenues of technical instruction for non- white persons in all fields; we have established and staffed Africa's most outstanding hospitals and heavily subsidized them, so that black African patients are charged a single fee of 70 United States cents irrespective of the complexity of the treatment they receive or the period they remain in hospital; we have built 600,000 houses in 20 years, 400,000 of which were for black African persons.
18.	We do not claim that in the pursuit of the ideals set out in Article 55 we have reached the stage where we can be self-satisfied. We do not claim to be perfect; but neither are we hypocrites. We acknowledge the common ideals and aspirations of mankind and we have formulated our policies accordingly. We recognize the problems that we have to overcome; we do not, however, criticize others for their shortcomings, for we realize that no State can be perfect. But many others do not hesitate to condemn our policies on moral and practical grounds. These charges are, however, completely unfounded. How can a system be wrong which leads peoples to self-determination and enables and assists them in maintaining their national identities; which provides them with higher social, educational and economic standards that can be attained anywhere else on the continent; which prepares them for independence by providing them with technical assistance and administrative support, thus creating opportunities for all of them to gain valuable experience in the art of government at various levels; which guarantees security for all by avoiding a struggle for power between non-white and white in South Africa and also between competing and traditionally hostile African nationalisms? In the light of the realities of the world today and of the substantial progress we have made in South Africa in the field of human uplift and in the light of the premises and objectives of our policies as I have described them, I feel that the record of South Africa can be measured honorably against the ideals set out in the Charter.
19.	I now wish to refer briefly to the wider field of the individual Member's responsibility. Here it is the duty of Member States to reflect to what extent each of them, individually, has adhered to the basic purposes and principles of the Charter. Without this, all our efforts to promote the moral and social welfare of our peoples would be in vain. These provisions impose a duty on Member States not only towards their own peoples but also towards other States and their peoples. I wish to refer to only three of these provisions, which in present circumstances cannot be sufficiently emphasized: first, the call to the United Nations to be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of the purposes and principles of the Charter; secondly, the call to all Members to settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered, and, thirdly, as a corollary to this, the call to all Members to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.
20.	Unless Members, individually and collectively, are willing to apply these provisions in their daily relations with others, there can be little hope of achieving the ideals of the Charter, of making a reality of the better world envisaged in 1945.
21.	My Government, for its part, has made it clear time and again that we base our relations with other States, first, on acceptance of the rule of nonintervention in their internal affairs; and secondly, on acceptance of the principle that differences of political systems are no bar to peaceful coexistence and friendly relations.
22.	We are of Africa. It is in this continent, especially in the southern region, that our destiny lies. We believe it to be in everyone's interest that all the countries of the region should develop and prosper, that the real enemies of Africa disease, ignorance, poverty and misery should be conquered.
23.	It is of cardinal importance, moreover, that the security and stability of this region should be preserved. We are therefore dismayed to note the emphasis being placed in various United Nations bodies on the use of force as a means for attaining political objectives in southern Africa.
24.	The strengthening of international security and the preservation of peace and order throughout the world is a major preoccupation of the United Nations this year. How can these aims be reconciled with resolutions not only condoning but actually encouraging the use of force in an area of the world where it is least likely to solve any problems? It should not be necessary for me to point out that it cannot be in the interest of any of the peoples of southern Africa to have the stability and security of the region shattered, for without stability and security the future progress and prosperity of the region are in jeopardy. I wish to state in this connexion that I welcome the stand which the Secretary-General took in a statement a fortnight ago against subversive activities and inter-ference in the internal affairs of other nations.
25.	My Government has been obliged to take cognizance of the growing threat to the southern African region and it has a duty to ensure the security of its peoples. Having said this, I must emphasize, however, that South Africa has no aggressive designs. Indeed, any form of aggression is foreign to our history, our traditions, our outlook and our policy.
26.	Two weeks ago, my Prime Minister reminded Parliament of his statement on assuming office four years ago that the independent black States on the borders of the Republic had no cause to spend a single cent on arms for their own defense since they knew that South Africa would not attack them and that they had nothing to fear from us.
27.	Certain States persist, however, in questioning our good faith. In these circumstances my Prime Minister stated that he was prepared to negotiate a non- aggression treaty with any African State, whether that State was an immediate neighbor or was situated further away, such as Zambia, the United Republic of Tanzania and other States in Africa. He added that he was prepared to take the initiative in negotiating a non-aggression treaty of this nature.
28.	From this rostrum I wish to invite other African States to give serious consideration to my Prime Minister's offer to conclude non-aggression pacts with them. It is our earnest hope that they will respond positively to this gesture. For my part, I shall be happy to discuss the matter further with representatives of any other African States who may be interested in our proposal or who may wish to have further information about it.
29.	We have heard a great deal in the last 12 months of the Lusaka Manifesto.1 If the spirit which this Manifesto has been said to symbolize does indeed reflect a genuine desire on the part of the African States to find a peaceful solution to the problems of Africa, one might have expected my Prime Minister's initiative to have been welcomed. This unfortunately has not so far been the case. I note with disappointment, indeed surprise, that certain African States have already rejected our offer. I hope very much that they will reconsider their attitude, for I know of nothing more that South Africa can do or say to convince them that any fears they may have of aggressive intentions on our part are totally unfounded. I trust, however, that if they should persist in spuming our offer they will at least refrain from accusing us of aggressive designs in future, for continued accusations of this sort cannot be reconciled with a rejection of a non-aggression pact.
30.	For our part, we are firmly resolved to pursue policies which will contribute to the maintenance of peace and the solution of the urgent problems which will face Africa in the years ahead. We would welcome co-operating with others in this great and challenging task. The Charter enjoins us to practice tolerance and to co-operate with one another. Surely in this commemorative year it is for us to respond positively. Let us all, therefore, rededicate ourselves to the ideals of the Charter and resolve to work together to achieve greater understanding and a better future for all mankind.



"
25,1970,MEX,"
33.	  Mr. President, I take great pleasure in following the fine tradition of congratulating Your Excellency upon your election. Your election is a recognition of your personal merits and of your long connection with the United Nations.
34.	I should also like to repeat in this hall the tribute which the President of Mexico made publicly a few days ago with regard to our SecretaryGeneral, U Thant, when in the capital of my country there was inaugurated the extraordinary assembly of those organizations which have as their objectives the promotion of tourism. He said: 'He is a man full of wisdom, strength, patience and faith in humanity, who on occasions we feel is surrounded by the incomprehension of many people as he carries out his difficult and noble task.'
35.	Now that the United Nations is concluding its first twenty-five years, we believe that perhaps its most outstanding achievement is to have survived. And this is not negligible if you think that, as was the case with the League of Nations, the end of the United Nations would have also meant the end of universal peace.
36.	Now, this quarter of a century has not been calm and peaceful. Even more, I might say, several of the conflicts which occurred during this quarter of a century have shown that the United Nations was not able fully to complete its mission to maintain and restore peace. Frequently, there has been no community of aims and purposes among the Members, aims and purposes upon which the Charter made collective security rest. But it would be unfair not to recognize also that the Organization has not ceased its efforts towards transforming itself and adapting itself to changing circumstances and requirements. Partial achievements, though incomplete and modest, and the hope of surviving in a dangerous epoch, are the most outstanding features of the picture which might be drawn of the United Nations during its first twenty-five years.
37.	We should not give to this celebration any sense of false optimism. It would be sterile, however, to go to the opposite extreme. The constructive thing would be to think about ways which would allow us in the future to overcome the obstacles lying in its path.
38.	In San Francisco we thought that with the United Nations there was beginning an era in which the promotion of national interests was going to be subject to more and more effective machinery for international regulation. The balance which could be drawn up of this period which is past reveals that this hope was premature. Nevertheless, we do not overlook the progress which in certain areas of the planet, particularly in Europe, although in a less spectacular form in other regions, has been achieved in creating economic zones which are greater that those delimited by the frontiers of States. However and this is one of the most interesting paradoxes of our time those countries which in abstract would be most called upon to find a solution for their problems by supranational or at least multinational means are those States in which nationalism in its diverse manifestations is an ever stronger and more vigorous force.
39.	The reason for this paradox is not, in my opinion, of a logical nature, but historical. In many instances it is a case of the noble aspirations of peoples who for many years lived in oppression or colonialism and who now seek to affirm their identity and dignity.
40.	We must not forget that the countries which have accepted economic integration in various forms, accepting limitations upon their sovereignty in order to accelerate their progress, have done so in the assurance that they were associating themselves with others in a similar state of development, and that in undertaking these integrations they did not compromise their vital interests.
41.	This confidence is lacking, quite rightly, among many members of the third world, and not only in connexion with the strict sphere of their economy, but also in the broader and more important sphere of knowing how far they can or should subordinate their own interests to interState organisms.
42.	In the international field there does not exist, and perhaps there will not exist for a long time, any organ which can define what international law provides, except in a very few cases which may reach the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Now, the norms that are specified in international law were drawn up in the past, which was not a happy past for many people.
43.	On the other hand, and in spite of the progress achieved, and thanks to the pressure of world public opinion, which is more and more informed as to what is happening in any corner of the world, there is no real means of obliging all States to respect the norms of international law, because there is no possibility, as we know, of using coercion through any other procedures than those mentioned in the Charter, which come under the responsibility of the Security Council, and the respective texts are very categorical regarding use of force. This is logical, because otherwise war would be unleashed on a catastrophic scale and force could never be used against a great Power, or, to use the technical formula, against a permanent member of the Security Council.
44.	A legal organ that consecrates this inequality is of course imperfect, because when the reality of power intervenes, then law must yield before some other form of regulation or accommodation of the conflicts of interests, namely political means.
45.	The weakness or imperfection of international law and of the United Nations, which at the present time are both the highest source and the crowning result, comes about because, in the face of this reality of power, or rather the different kinds of power political, military or economic of States, the reconciliation of interests which is the objective of all international organizations can better be achieved through norms of a specific nature rather than general rules, and not by coercive orders coming from a higher authority placed above the contending parties; rather it must be achieved by agreements among them, although at times they are not considered as just as the weaker party might desire. With all its restrictions, with all its risks, nothing can substitute for negotiation as a formula par excellence to resolve conflicts between States.
46.	Furthermore, the antecedents of certain fundamental precepts of the Charter of the United Nations and the exegesis of them which eminent jurists have given us show that the organ of greatest effective authority in the international community, namely the Security Council, is not subject to what is called in the jurisprudence of one of the great legal systems of the world the doctrine of stare decisis. The Council can settle in a different manner similar or even identical cases when it considers that it thus furthers the maintenance of peace throughout the world which is its primary responsibility. This is an enormous power which can, indeed, fly against our idea of justice. And if the majority of States have accepted this in the interests of peace, we have the right to expect that the great Powers will exercise it not in an egotistical spirit but rather with nobility and a sense of responsibility.
47.	Fortunately, the international legal order is not restricted to this imperfect positive law in the process of formation. It includes also another element whose existence becomes more and more evident every day if we raise our eyes to the higher level on which the conscience of man, not force, prevails. It is on that level that the General Assembly acts with greater authority than any other organ when those who are its Members are capable of stating their opinions and casting their votes, not in a spirit of narrow egotism, but rather as spokesmen for humanity, to whose laws their agreements and resolutions refer.
48.	The United Nations cannot be stronger or make more rapid progress than human solidarity allows. It would be unrealistic to pretend that any one of the Members of this Organization would come here to neglect its fundamental interests, but we must not overlook the fact that there is an intermediate zone between the national and the universal, that is, the regional zone, especially when, in addition to geographical considerations, there is also, as is the case in Latin America, a community based on language and origin.
49.	Therefore, I believe that the past twenty-five years show that the founders were right when they recognized the outstanding function that the regional organizations could play with regard to both the maintenance of peace and security and the promotion of social progress or the very important and delicate task of defending human rights. Naturally, we must be very careful that the actions of the regional organizations are carried out strictly within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations.
50.	After these reflections of a general nature upon the occasion of the anniversary we are celebrating, I shall take up certain aspects of the present international situation, which I believe shows some encouraging signs despite the dark shadows cast by events in the Middle East. With regard to them, I shall restrict myself to saying on behalf of my Government that we most sincerely hope that the States directly concerned, as also the great Powers, will find some means of resolving this conflict soon and establishing peace. It would be absurd were it otherwise.
51.	Among the encouraging signs is the fact that for the first time there are real possibilities that the two great nuclear Powers may agree to limit, and perhaps reduce, their launching systems for offensive and defensive nuclear weapons. If this hope becomes a reality, there will have occurred one of the most transcendental events since the Second World War. The confidence it would generate as a basis for new disarmament agreements, and the vast resources it might free for the benefit of humanity, would doubtless change the whole picture of international relations.
52.	The Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America, established under the Treaty of Tlatelolco,  has continued to make progress gradually but without interruption. In the course of the present year two new States have become members of that Agency: Guatemala and Venezuela. This has increased the area of the Latin American zone subject to a regime of complete absence of nuclear weapons. It now extends to more than 6,600,000 square kilometers, and the population of the zone now amounts to 117 million.
53.	Shortly after I had the privilege of addressing this Assembly last year, the Government of the United Kingdom, on 11 December 1969, deposited its instruments of ratification to the two Additional Protocols of the Treaty, thus becoming the first State Party to them. Later, on 13 August 1970, the President of the
United States announced that on that date he had sent Additional Protocol II to the Senate recommending that it be given early and favorable consideration.
54.	The General Conference, the supreme organ of OPANAL, has just concluded its first session, the opening meeting of which was honored, on 7 September 1969, by the presence of the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations and the DirectorGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
55.	In addition to electing as SecretaryGeneral of the organization an outstanding Latin American personality well known here at the United Nations. Ambassador Leopoldo Bemtes, the Conference adopted a series of important resolutions, among which I would point out those having the object of expediting the conclusion of safeguard agreements between member States and the Vienna Agency, which we hope will serve to promote the utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the region so that we can accelerate economic and social progress among our peoples.
56.	The Latin American States, as U Thant said very well last year, have worked long and hard in constructing the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America. Hence it seems that we have a right to receive from the nuclear Powers that cooperation which the General Assembly of the United Nations exhorted them to extend to us.
57.	The delegation of Mexico, which participates in the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, has made a constant effort to cooperate so as to improve as far as possible the draft treaty on the prohibition of the emplacement of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and the ocean floor. 
58.	We attribute the greatest importance to the formal commitment undertaken by, among other States, the Soviet Union and the United States which for a long time the two Chairmen of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament considered it very difficult to accept to continue in good faith negotiations concerning further measures for the prevention of an arms race on the seabed and ocean floor.
59.	In the First Committee we shall attempt, in consultation with the coChairmeb of the Committee on Disarmament, to achieve what we could not achieve in Geneva. Nevertheless, if our efforts fail once again I announce here and now that Mexico will not be an obstacle to the approval, which we hope will be unanimous, of a resolution on the draft treaty of which I have been speaking similar to those which have been adopted in the past with regard to the Treaties on Outer Space [resolution 2222 (XXI)] and the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]. Naturally, in that case the eventual signature of the treaty by the Government of my country would have to be accompanied by an interpretative declaration which would cover certain aspects of particular interest to us, among which I would note the question of the emplacement of conventional weapons on the continental shelf, which would be impossible for Mexico to accept because according to our Constitution the continental shelf is part of our national territory.
60.	Another matter concerning the question of disarmament which was given special attention was the problem of chemical and bacteriological weapons. This year various declarations have been made which have strengthened the Geneva Protocol of 17 June 1925 and accelerated the process of converting this Protocol into an instrument that can be adhered to universally, as was requested by the SecretaryGeneral of our Organization.
61.	However, we recognize the enormous difficulties involved in achieving an agreement on a matter as delicate as this. That caused us to propose a provisional measure that in essence consists of requesting that States issue declarations in which they unilaterally renounce the manufacture and use in wartime of bacteriological weapons and undertake the firm commitment to eliminate present stocks as soon as their renunciation takes the form of a convention.
62.	For several years, and especially during the negotiations which culminated in the approval of the nonproliferation Treaty, Mexico has insisted on the necessity of not forgetting the goal set in 1959, namely, general and complete disarmament under effective international control, which the General Assembly then called 'the most important question now before the world'.
63.	Consistent with this position of Mexico, we participated in the elaboration and negotiation of a draft comprehensive program of disarmament, which the representative of Mexico had the privilege of submitting on behalf of the three cosponsoring delegations  Mexico, Sweden and Yugoslavia on 27 August last. 
64.	We are convinced that the approval of this comprehensive program by the Assembly at the present session would deserve to occupy an outstanding place among the various acts by which the United Nations intends to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary.
65.	My Government has been concerned about the apparent stalemate in which the work of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations finds itself. We see there a problem which has been of concern to the Organization from the time of its creation; that is to say, the need to take collective measures exclusively under the Charter when Member States prove powerless to prevent violence.
66.	I must repeat that it is urgent for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to conclude its task of elaborating a draft on liability for damage caused by the launching of objects into outer space. We believe that we have a right to expect that the space Powers
s Ibid., annex C, section 42.
will give us cooperation as enthusiastic as that which we showed in the elaboration of the Agreement on the return of astronauts [resolution 2345 (XXII)].
67.	A year ago, in this Assembly [1833rd meeting], we asked the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Seabed and Ocean Floor Beyond the Limits 'Of National Jurisdiction to accelerate the preparation of a complete and well-balanced declaration of principles capable of promoting international cooperation in the field of the exploration and utilization of the seabed and the ocean floor. We believe that we should not delay that declaration any longer because that zone and its resources constitute the common patrimony of all mankind. We think also that we must establish an international regime which would include machinery to ensure the just distribution of the benefits, and that the establishment of such a regime need not wait until States agree on the precise delimitation of the zone, since there are vast undersea areas which are obviously outside the jurisdiction of any country.
68.	Our Charter mentions the International Court of Justice as one of its six principal organs. It is obvious, however, that the Court has not played the role assigned to it when our Organization was established. My Government has cosponsored an item which calls upon the Assembly to examine the reform of the Statute of the Court. Mexico would like to see, as a result of the study by the Assembly, a renovated Court in which the Judges could keep their independence but which would not, because of that, keep them isolated from the great currents which govern international law in our day and the international realities which influence it,
69.	The Special Committee established by the Assembly,  which began its work in the capital of Mexico in 1964, has already drafted a declaration on the principles of international law referring to friendly relations and cooperation among States. I note with particular satisfaction that among them there figures the principle of nonintervention, which is defined in the draft in terms essentially similar to those approved by this Assembly at its twentieth session, when it made the most complete and precise formulation which had been achieved so far of this principle in which we Mexicans have seen, in the more than a century and a half of our existence, the cornerstone of international coexistence.
70.	Some speakers have referred in this debate to the problem to which Mexico attributes special importance of the hijacking of aircraft, which endangers the lives of many innocent persons. Recently, the President of Mexico expressed his deep concern over this situation and made various suggestions with regard to the motives and consequences of such criminal acts, stating his confidence that by means of international cooperation it would be possible to achieve some means of preventing these hijackings, and especially of denying hijackers impunity.
71.	The principal economic item on our agenda is the adoption of an international strategy for development for the decade 19701979. After six long sessions the Preparatory Commission succeeded in preparing a draft which has been submitted to this Assembly [A 17982, para. 16].
72.	We attribute fundamental importance to this document, which reflects the economic and social aspirations of developing countries. These aspirations in the last few years have at many international forums been identified with ever greater precision with a view to establishing the necessary policies if these goals are to be attained. Goals and policies are set forth in the project not only in the field of international trade and finance, but also in the very important field of human development, because, as long as we maintain an economic imbalance throughout the world the origin of many conflicts and tensions we cannot think that there will be any stable political order.
73.	Of great importance in reducing these economic imbalances is international cooperation which will make it possible for the technology of industrialized countries to be transferred to developing countries without the latter having to accept the excessive exigencies of private entities. As has occurred already in other fields, the transfer of technology should become a true international public service.
74.	Now the adequate transfer of technology to developing areas depends not only on the ability of the population to absorb the new techniques, but also on their ability to import machinery and modern equipment, which in turn depends upon an increase in their exports. Therefore, among the objectives to be achieved during the decade, we find an increment of 7 per cent annually in exports and imports. To this end we shall have to eliminate many obstacles which restrict the access of the production of these countries to international markets.
75.	I should like now to repeat the profound concern of my Government with regard to the possibility that a wave of protectionism might arise in the industrialized countries. This would be in absolute contradiction to the objectives of the decade and would invalidate to a great extent the system of universal preferences which is being discussed in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
76.	A war of trade restrictions among the developed nations would reduce the access of all countries to markets. This would principally be to the detriment of the poor countries, although the restrictions were not immediately addressed to specific products. We would thus have taken a step backward in world policy for the liberalization of international trade which was put into practice at the end of the Second World War and has been an important factor in the increase in production and consumption in the participant countries. Why return to the policy of the 1930s, of sad memory? It is true that 1970 does not find the United Nations as many of the founders would have liked it to be.
8
77.	However, let us recognize that the second postwar period, which culminated and terminated in the dreadful days of November 1962, when the two super nuclear Powers, with common sense and great realism avoided the hecatomb which for a decade had been threatening the world, was in many ways fruitful since the other period, after some ten years of pressure from the Versailles Treaty, resulted in the worst economic depression of all times and ten years later in the most terrible war the world has ever suffered in addition to the fact that in that first postwar period the empires strove to continue their status as if the nineteenth century had not yet come to an end.
78.	We face at present new difficulties; but some either reflect new problems a natural result in the case of a densely populated planet with better communications on which technological progress has widened in a surprising manner the distance between wellbeing and poverty or else old forgotten problems, such as the perennial longing for equality and dignity among all men.
79.	Many of these problems have a solution, others perhaps do not. Some fall within the sphere of every country whereas others, such as that of peace, can be attacked by international action. Many times the frontier between them is not very precise. Those relating to economic and social progress are fundamentally of an internal nature, but they require cooperation from the United Nations, its specialized agencies and its regional organs if they are to be eventually overcome.
80.	What we have no right to do is to become disenchanted. The United Nations is an imperfect instrument but it is the only one available to us and for that reason even if not for the many others it is important that we renew our resolve to make it ever more effective and respected. It is at least our duty to keep our Organization alive and strive to have it some day gather together all peoples as coming generations succeed more appropriately and energetically in bringing it into line with new times and with the anguish and the hopes of both the present and the future.


"
25,1970,DOM,"


 Mr. President, it was a source of great pleasure for me to see you elected to preside over the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly at a time when our Organization has recorded in the pages of history the twenty-fifth anniversary of its founding in San Francisco when it was set up to guide the destiny of the peoples Members of the Organization and serve as a repository for the principles for the maintenance and preservation of the peace and progress that our civilization demands.
44.	The election which has led to your being chosen to preside over this Assembly a very wise choice indeed is a tribute to your great country, which has contributed to the development of the history of free nations a tradition of peace that serves as an example for the legal community that we constitute a country which has always commanded respect and admiration from all corners of the earth. Your election is also a tribute of recognition and respect rendered to your wisdom, your qualities as a statesman and your devotion to the cause defended by the nations assembled in this world Organization. Under your enlightened and experienced guidance we are sure that the Assembly will embark upon a session which in and of itself is of great importance because of the tremendous tasks confronting all delegations, the significance of the anniversary that is coming up shortly and because here, as never before, a spirit of understanding and coexistence should prevail above all momentary considerations so that we may inaugurate a new phase in international law under the most auspicious circumstances. We are duty bound to display this spirit because of the wisdom, the experience and the maturity which we have gained during twenty-four regular sessions of the General Assembly, sessions which have led us to the point where we will be commemorating this exceptional event very shortly in solemn ceremony and celebration.
45.	It is, therefore, an honor for my delegation to convey to you our good wishes on your election and we are sure that your wisdom will enlighten and guide our thinking and our decisions during the discharge of the mandate that we have received from our respective Governments.
46.	During the holding of the twenty-fourth regular session of the General Assembly the Dominican Republic, in a desire to contribute in some way to the historic importance of the session upon which we are just embarking, conveyed to the SecretaryGeneral an expression of our desire that as part of the methodology of the specific question of a new reform of the United Nations Charter we should include consideration of the right of veto in the Security Council and the Powers enjoying that right, the apolitical status of outer space and the right of new small States to be admitted to the world Organization.
47.	twenty-five years after the founding of the United Nations we cannot fail to recognize the changes that have occurred in the world of today in all essential aspects and, most particularly, with respect to international life upon the emergence of new States, all of which makes it incumbent upon us to find new formulae to bring the constituent principles of the Organization up to date taking into account the experience gained over a quarter of a century and the ideals that justify its existence.
48.	We all recall very clearly the debates that developed in connexion with Article 27 of the Charter of the United Nations. I refer to the right of veto which was accepted finally in the form in which it now appears in the Charter.
49.	We must recognize the fact that after the last World War and mankind is still suffering its residual effects statesmen wanted to lay unshakable foundations for the maintenance and preservation of peace in the world but none the less, the spirit of war had an impact on the solutions involving the interests of the victorious States. That situation was most typical among the great Powers. I venture to believe that that cause and no other, taken together with a need to find a substitute for the classical system of alliances to maintain international equilibrium, predominated in the deliberations that finally led to the provision of the veto in the Security Council.
50.	There seems no doubt that to a considerable degree the veto has fulfilled the objective for which it was created, despite the frequent exercise of this right by the States that possess the veto. But the facts tend to show that if on some occasions this tool has proved useful to avoid greater evils, it is equally certain that in other instances the frequency with which this exceptional right has been exercised, a right which is discriminatory in the light of the principles of democracy, has come to constitute an obstacle to the progress that the United Nations should have attained in achieving the purposes for which it was set up.
51.	This modem age, with the present stage of development of space science and the achievements of man through his journeys to the moon, has created a new individual and collective mentality, and we should admit this now. The States that make up our Organization are not immune to the impact of this new mentality.
52.	However, we cannot deny that man is just as imperfect as he was on the first day of his creation, but it is obvious that, like civilizations, generations move and are transformed in accordance with the immutable laws of human progress.
53.	For this reason the fundamental instrument which governs us cannot have failed to feel the impact of these uncontrollable pressures. Hence we find the reason justifying the need for reforms of the principles which, until the past decade, and particularly if we look back twenty-five years, were appropriate to mitigate the imperfections of international life and the conflicts that it has been possible to confine to certain areas of the world without allowing these conflicts to involve the Members of the Organization in a new total warlike adventure where the last word would be had by those who had predominance in nuclear weapons that are capable of wiping out every vestige of human life and civilization from the face of the earth.
54.	Accordingly, on the occasion of this important Assembly, concern about the veto has cropped up once again. It might be said that recently an awareness of the veto has been developed that has come to be expressed by certain radical manifestations, as in 'he. case of Brazil which has set forth the criterion that the veto should be prohibited if we wish to preserve the United Nations from the decadence likely to lead to its final dissolution.
55.	Our country's initiative would constitute a step forward in this direction. It pays tribute to the law of nature that does not proceed by leaps and bounds, and at the same time it is in accordance with the proven experience that the life of nations and of men develops in accordance with a process of evolution that cannot nor should not be violated, subject to the penalty of retreating in a move backward to previous positions or a position marking a step even further back.
56.	For that reason we are advocating a solution which moves between the enshrinement of the division of the veto with the feature of one veto for two votes or for the adoption of a quota of vetoes. If circumstances would permit, this would be the position we would take if we agreed to revise the Charter.
57.	The legal rules that constitute the body of law governing outer space would be incomplete if they did not rest upon a fundamental rule drawn from the notion of the apolitical status of space, the area in which those rules should be applied and respected. We are dealing here with such a new and sensitive international contribution as the idea of jurisprudence to apply to outer space. In this exceedingly new field we shall certainly have to grapple with great difficulties, periods of stagnation and experiences, and we will have to exercise the utmost wisdom in coping with this task. In the light of the strictest provisions of the Charter it will also be essential to think above all of the survival of the human race in the face of the dangers inherent in the conquest of the vast reaches of the stars.
58.	With these concerns in mind, and convinced as we are that the progress of technology in respect of the conquest of outer space is proceeding at a dizzy pace, we have sketched out our concern which might seem a bit sudden if it were not for the fact that we are already confronted with inescapable facts and realities in referring as we have to the fact that outer space should be considered as apolitical in this twenty- fifth session of the General Assembly. We have made these comments because we are desirous of contributing by this expression of our goodwill to the celebration of a quarter of a century of the United Nations.
59.	The advent of new, smaller States to independent international life has been the subject of speculation and informal public statements which may perhaps have created a degree of confusion in certain international quarters, and even prejudices that can mislead the public conscience. The reaction that has been produced, as was logical to assume, has sometimes led to the possibility of people thinking somewhat lightly of how far we can go in weakening the legal equality of States by a system of restrictions.
60.	If this idea were to gain a little more currency, it would foster various prejudices harmful to our Organization and could eventually perhaps in some way undermine people's confidence in the raison d'etre of this Organization, an organization that we should defend firmly against all obstacles that may to a greater or lesser degree affect its necessary development in the interest of maintaining the legal order free from discrimination of any kind.
61.	Obviously, we should foresee events and prevent the abnormalities that may affect our Organization. In that manner we will preserve the legacy of experience that we, the peoples that make up this Organization, have garnered here after two and a half decades of what has often been stormy activity which an organization which has met the tests to which it has been subjected up until this great moment in history.
62.	Accordingly, it would be appropriate for us to look forward to the situation that may arise in connexion with the admission of new smaller States. We believe that, with this approach, we can find workable solutions, so that when we come to deal with a problematical or contentious case, we can find the way out which will meet the facts of the case, without destroying the principle of the legal equality of States.
63.	My delegation has always supported the principles of political decolonization and the right to self determination of peoples, which have been given concrete expression under the aegis of the United Nations. We have kept this position and we shall continue to do so, convinced as we are that this provision contained in the constitution of this Organization is in accordance with the most appropriate procedure for forming the national conscience of the people so favored, an<2 to ensure that the transitional period towards the highest degree of self-government can achieve at least a minimum level of efficiency, in order that it may enjoy lasting status within the international legal community.
64.	But, together with political decolonization, we would also like to see, concomitantly, the idea of economic decolonization, which is possible only if the States Members of our Organization share the idea of economic interdependence, which is becoming more and more pressing for the same reasons for which we pay homage in this world of today to the principle of the interdependence of States. We should strengthen this edifice without it being necessary to distinguish between dissimilarities of population, territory, or social, economic, cultural or political development, which reflect the characteristic features and peculiarities of these States, and we should increasingly make progress in this idea of international economic interdependence.
65.	We have maintained this line of approach and we will continue to maintain it in the Economic and Social Council and in all the subsidiary bodies which are entrusted with the heavy responsibility of fostering the progress of peoples through modern methods. Many barriers of prejudices and archaic conventional attitudes will still have to be overthrown. In this task which confronts the States Members of the Organization, the Dominican Republic has steadily opted in favor of the adoption of new formula and rules which can lead us to solutions that will eradicate the pressures and international tensions that allow us no respite.
66.	In recent years the Dominican Republic has advocated a formula to put an end to the conflict in the Middle East in accordance with methods for the solution of situations of this kind. We are concerned about the state of stagnation in which this effort for peace has been bogged down; yet the effectiveness of this effort is the responsibility not only of all free peoples of the world but also of the Organization itself.
67.	The renewal of the mandate entrusted by the SecretaryGeneral to his Special Representative, Ambassador Jarring, has not only helped to reaffirm our faith in the instruments available to us to restore peace where it has been breached, but it has also served to lessen considerable international tensions considerably and it has strengthened the hope that, finally, it will be possible to come to terms acceptable to the parties involved.
68.	We understand that the road ahead will be subject to certain alternate choices which are characteristic of international life, but we see looming up the end of the task that we have undertaken to reach the peace agreement that we all long for.
69.	The situation that has affected VietNam for a number of years has always been a source of concern to my country, which has cooperated as fully as possible and which in every instance has offered proper support in the difficult task of preserving the peace.
70.	This is the policy that a small country such as ours would never wish to depart from at any time. We are proud of being a founding Member of this community of nations, which is the greatest that has ever existed since the origin of mankind.
71.	We must feel gratified when we see that the United States of America has been withdrawing sizable contingents of troops from the center of military operations in that area and that the central Government has shown that it will continue to withdraw these troops in accordance with the statements made by President Nixon. It is highly significant that this fact should have occurred precisely when we were entering upon the twenty-fifth regular session of the General Assembly of the world Organization, with new prospects opening up for the future of the States Members of this Organization.
72.	We sincerely believe that we are on the verge of witnessing the departure from VietNamese territory of the last United States troops in accordance with the timetable worked out. It is very comforting to see that after the stagnation in the efforts to reduce nuclear weapons that were being accumulated at a terrifying dramatic pace, we can now say that progress has been made, which my delegation cannot overlook.
73.	In all sincerity I believe that this is perhaps the most important item for those of us who are participating in this General Assembly, and we would hope that the Assembly will emerge from this session fortified with all its constructive potential. This would serve as a kind of lever of Archimedes, which is the will of all peoples on this commemorative anniversary to mark the dawn of a new era in the world in which good understanding will prevail designed to achieve the goal we have set ourselves in the face of the dilemma with which the unbridled arms race confronts us a race into which we have been impelled by lack of confidence and by our blind attitude towards the danger that hangs over us.
74.	In behalf of the Government I represent, may I be permitted to pay a tribute of gratitude for this important development which has allayed the unrest and tensions to which we have been subjected for so many years?
75.	We should also take into account the efforts made to come to an agreement on a treaty to prohibit the emplacement of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed, the ocean floor and in the subsoil thereof, which in truth would constitute an effective step towards the conclusion of the treaty on general and complete disarmament which is so anxiously awaited.
76.	In addition, for the same reasons, we would praise the action that has been undertaken to halt the development of chemical and bacteriological means of warfare and also arduous efforts under way to ensure that such weapons are prohibited from the arsenals of nations.
77.	It is disturbing to note that the production of such means of destruction should have marked a considerable step backwards in international thinking on war despite the Geneva Protocol of 1925 which prohibits the use of this type of weapon. And that reversion to a position we had left behind long age under the influence of the lofty principles of humanity and should have created a situation in which the General Assembly finds it necessary to call upon States to fulfil the principles of that important Protocol.
78.	Accordingly, it would be well for us to come to an agreement which not only guarantees observance of the prohibition in Platonic terms but also provides for the verification of compliance with this Protocol. Without the latter measure, which has already received the support of some Members of the Organization, we shall not be able to achieve chemical and bacteriological disarmament and thus safeguard mankind from weapons that are as inhuman as nuclear weapons themselves.
79.	Every effort that is made to arrive at reasonable disarmament and to avoid the overflow of these vast arsenals, which are a source of concern to us, will command the vigorous support of the Dominican Republic. We therefore viewed certain relaxations of tension which have been brought about in Geneva in the field of disarmament as a promising omen that will increase the confidence of peace-loving peoples.
80.	Since the United Nations has been able to survive all the tests to which it has been subjected so far, this argument alone would suffice to justify the efforts we should exert to ensure that it continues to achieve the objectives for which it was created, at a decisive moment when the scourge of war had imperiled all of modern civilization.
81.	True, there has been much criticism of the United Nations. We must confess that much of this criticism is justified, but we cannot deny that most of it is exaggerated or not really justified if we examine the criticism objectively.
82.	No matter how strict we may be, we cannot deny its positive achievements which have proved to be milestones in history. This criterion allows us to take into consideration the fact that we have tried to create a perfect Organization in a world in which mankind's handiwork always suffers from imperfections.
83.	However that may be, under the sheltering umbrella of the principles of the Charter we have been able to demonstrate how useful dialog is at the high level of this Organization. We thus arrive at the affirmation that it is difficult to negotiate when we hear the cannons roar.
84.	It is understandable that despite the complexities of international life some would like to see the United Nations take more dynamic action, and more willingness to comply with its resolutions. I venture to surmise that this is due largely to the sensibilities involved and the magnitude of the interests often in conflict. But that does not mean that we should not foster the idea of a fresh endeavor and for this it will probably be necessary to bring the Charter up to date so that it will reflect the changes that have occurred and will continue to occur in our time.
85.	While it is obvious that the principles of the United Nations are influential even as they are now structured, we would hope that its legal and moral authority will be exercised with greater efficiency when they have been revised and have had time to acquire their full strength and vigor.
86.	I should now like to make a comment concerning the record of the tremendous accomplishments of the United Nations during the years of its existence and say that my delegation would venture to suggest that if the Organization has not been very effective, as its critics allege, that is in large measure the fault of ourselves, the Member States, because in fact we have not given the Organization all the support and effective collaboration needed to uphold those principles and resolutions which have not been applied or have been applied imperfectly or very tardily.
87.	During the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly my Government had the opportunity to state its interest in the idea that the Assembly should provide favorable conditions for a firm step towards agreement on a system for international security. 
88. At that time my delegation said, and I reaffirm it now, that the mobilization of wills towards an achievement of this kind for the world would be the best contribution we could make to the celebrations marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations.
89. It would also be the greatest tribute we could pay on this happy occasion to all who have been the victims of war.

25,1970,ISR,"93.	: Mr. President, your country, Norway, has a warm place in Israel's heart. Our common sacrifice drew our peoples together in the darkness of the Nazi age, and friendship has lit up every road that we have trodden ever since. Your erudition and integrity enlarge the respect which your country's name evokes across the world. In carrying out your charge you have before you the recent example of your predecessor, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph, who graced henPresidency with charm, originality and deep international convictions.
94.	The twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly has been chosen as a commemorative occasion. What we need most is not a festive celebration but a lucid exercise in self-criticism. The United Nations has fallen on hard days. Its resonance is diminished and its flame is burning low. It exerts no more than a marginal influence on the main issues of conflict in our times, and the central currents of international thought and action flow outside its walls. There is a sharp paradox in that turn of fortune, for there has never been a greater objective need for a unitary framework of international relations to express the common interest of mankind. For the first time in history distance has become irrelevant, and all peoples are bound together in danger and opportunity. Thus, international institutions seem to be declining in the very conditions which logically favor their success. The United Nations should be asking itself with implacable candor: 'what went wrong?'.
95.	The trouble lies, of course, mainly in the discordant policies of the States which compose international society. But this does not absolve the Organization from the duty to analyze its own experience and to take a rational and effective view of its priorities and procedures in the coming years. This Organization is young in relation to the immensity of the vision which it serves. Yet the rhythm of change has been so intense that the world in which the United Nations was born now belongs to receding memory. There is urgent need for Governments to determine the place which the United Nations occupies in their policies, and for the United Nations itself to modernize its concepts, structures, and its methods of operation. Only thus will the gap between the brilliant hope and the harsh reality be reduced.
96.	The main international preoccupation is now focused on the region where the Arab and Israeli nations were born and in which they must forever live side by side. In the summer of 1967 the Security Council and the General Assembly were the inactive spectators of a war that they did nothing to prevent. In recent weeks, they have watched a Member State in the Middle East pass through its most destructive and agonizing ordeal. It may be that in its present strength and condition our Organization is unable to restrain violence and ensure security as its Charter envisaged. But it need not renounce its role as the central forum from which the policies of its Members may be communicated to the opinion of the world. In that spirit I come to this rostrum to state Israel's views on the tensions which convulse our region and hang heavy on the conscience and concern of all mankind.
97.	The point of reference is still the unforgotten drama of 1967. Forty months have passed since a resolute attempt was made to bring about the destruction of Israel's peace, sovereignty and very life through the strangling grip of belligerency, blockade, encirclement and aggressive assault. Israel's policy is still dominated by the recollection of the brief moment when its extinction was a real and vivid prospect. The defeat of that attempt by its solitary effort and independent sacrifice is inscribed on Israel's unfailing memory. Beyond its place in Israel's history, that victory was a landmark in the human journey towards justice, law and peace. We still recall the relief and consolation which gripped the enlightened world when Israel tore the strangling fingers from its throat.
98.	Israel remembers. It cannot forget; it cannot forget the horror from which it barely escaped or the sense of salvation which came from its successful resistance. From then until now our national policy has been inspired by two central purposes: to build a structure of permanent peace with the neighboring States, if their policy makes that possible, and, in any case, to avoid a return to the conditions of anarchy and vulnerability out of which the war exploded.
99.	In its tense debates during 1967, the United Nations developed the contours of an international policy designed to meet the new conditions created by the 1967 war. It rejected all proposals for reproducing the situation which had led to one war and which, if renewed, would lead inevitably to another. It voted down five proposals for a return to the old armistice lines, and in November 1967 it called for the establishment of a just and lasting peace, based on the total renunciation of belligerency and war, the liquidation of maritime blockade and hostile acts, and the explicit recognition by the Arab States and Israel of each other's sovereignty, independence and national identity. It also called for the establishment of 'secure and recognized boundaries'. These have never existed in our region; they must be established by agreement for the first time.
100.	The simple theme of this international policy was that the structure of peace should be built by agreement between the States of the Middle East. An international representative, held in universal trust, was appointed to assist the parties in the promotion of that agreement. Moreover, a ceasefire had been proposed by the Security Council and accepted by the parties on the morrow of the war. According to its terms, the ceasefire was to be unconditional, of indefinite duration, and could not be legitimately set aside before the attainment of permanent peace.
101.	In its sessions since 1967 the General Assembly has reviewed successive attempts to bring about agreement on the establishment of a final peace Now and then a prospect has glowed briefly, only W be extinguished almost before it could be discerned. But by the summer of this year the perils were great enough to compel new thinking and new effort on many sides. In March 1969 President Nasser had unilaterally repudiated his country's agreement to maintain the ceasefire. The resultant warfare across the Suez Canal was henceforward constant, destructive and of growing intensity. And it was achieving no purpose whatever. Attempts to bring about Israel's collapse through attrition had totally failed. Israel was aware of the loss and waste inflicted on it and, still more, on Egypt by the war. But neither the artillery assaults on Israel's forces from the south, nor terrorist attacks on helpless civilians from the north and east, nor the arrogant violence and piracy of Arab terrorists in countries remote from the conflict had prevented our national enterprise from going forward in swift growth. Above all, the attacks by regular armies and terrorist groups had not dislodged us from any point along the ceasefire lines which we were resolved and internationally entitled to hold until the attainment of peace. The war of attrition brought its authors neither victory nor honor. Indeed, it exposed the Arab States to tensions, frustrations and dangers far greater than those by which Israel was afflicted.
102.	In this dilemma Arab policy faced two choices. It could acknowledge the futility of war, accept the reestablishment of the ceasefire and embark on the negotiation of a final peace; or it could appeal to forces outside the region for help to continue and intensify hostilities. The first choice would have meant to work with Israel for the establishment of peace; the second meant the pursuit of Soviet aid for maintaining the war at a higher level of intensity. Alas, it is clear that in the early months of 1970 the second choice was taken.
103.	Thereafter, the conflict was extended with every passing month beyond its regional context. It now took on a global dimension. A system of SAM2 missiles had been erected so that the artillery bombardment of Israeli forces could be carried out without fear of aerial response. The weapons were defensive only in the narrow tactical sense; they were geared to an offensive strategy, the elimination of the ceasefire and its replacement by a constant war of attrition. The missiles stand guard in order that the guns should be free to speak. When this strategy failed, through Israel's successful response, the more complex SAM3 missiles, this time manned by Soviet personnel, were introduced. And by early summer Soviet pilots were flying operational missions in the battle zone. Now, this was more ominous than anything that had gone on before. This aroused a worldwide concern. Nothing of the kind had happened anywhere since the end of the Second World War, apart from the unhappy participation of Soviet pilots in the bombardment of villages in Yemen in 1963. But Soviet involvement in the Suez Canal hostilities had far graver implications. It is bad enough that regional conflicts should rage unsolved through a rejection of the normal principles of ceasefire and negotiation. It is far worse when a great Power intervenes to aggravate a regional conflict, to widen its scope, to risk counteraction by other Powers and thus to extend the perils of a local war to all mankind. The Soviet intervention does not concern Israel alone. It has other aims. Its other aims are to win predominance in the Mediterranean; to outflank the European defense system from the south; to establish a large foreign army on African soil in contempt for the principle of African independence; and to bring about a general disturbance of the international equilibrium. Thus, President Nasser's repudiation of the ceasefire and the increasing scope of Soviet intervention have results which the world can ill afford.
104.	It was in the light of those conditions that my Government studied the United States peace initiative in June and July 1970. We knew that some Arab States and all the Palestine terrorist organizations had rejected that proposal because it spoke of peace, to which they are in principle totally opposed. We knew that Egypt and Jordan had accompanied their acceptance of the initiative by a statement of terms and conditions incompatible with its principles and with its authors' stated intentions. There were other features of the proposal which raised difficulties for us within our parliamentary and democratic system. But we saw this initiative with all its defects and complexities as an opportunity to explore the conditions of a final peace. These considerations prevailed above all the others. And so, on 4 August, the Government of Israel determined and formulated a policy to which it still adheres. We decided to designate a representative to discussions to be held under Ambassador Jarring's auspices with the United Arab Republic and Jordan.
105.	We stated that:
'Israel's position in favor of a ceasefire on the basis of reciprocity on all fronts, including the Egyptian front, in accordance with the Security Council's ceasefire resolutions remains unchanged. On the basis of clarifications given by the United States Government in this matter, Israel is prepared to reply affirmatively to the United States proposal for a ceasefire for at least three months on the Egyptian front.'
We further agreed:
'to hold discussions under Ambassador Jarring's auspices within the framework of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) on the basis of the expression of readiness by the parties to carry out the Security Council's resolution in all its parts, in order to achieve an agreed and binding contractual peace agreement which would ensure:
'(a) Termination by Egypt and Israel of all claims or states of belligerency and respect and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of each other and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries, free from threats or acts of force. Each of the parties to be responsible within its territory for the prevention of all hostile acts by regular military forces or paramilitary forces, including irregular forces, against the armed forces or against civilians living in the territory of the other party;
'(ft) Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the 1967 conflict to secure, recognized and agreed boundaries to be determined in the peace agreements.'
That was the text to which we agreed.
106.	And, finally, we made clear that:
'Israel will not claim the prior acceptance by the other party of her positions, as Israel does not accept in advance the positions of the other parties as communicated publicly or otherwise. Each party will be free to present its proposals on the matters under discussion.'
107.	The ceasefire agreement, as members will see, held a central place in our response to the United States peace initiative. The United Arab Republic had limited its acceptance of the ceasefire to a period of ninety days. That restriction raised issues which would not have existed with comparable force in an unlimited ceasefire which would have brought the military phase of the conflict to a permanent end. Instead of this we now had an explicit prospect that after three months the United Arab Republic might regard the ceasefire as having expired. And the futile but destructive war of attrition would be resumed. Since that was the United Arab Republic position, its implications had to be seriously weighed. We had to ask ourselves whether the short negotiating period would be devoted to a genuine quest for peace; or whether it would be used as a respite for the United Arab Republic, with Soviet aid, to improve its prospect for a military solution by a massive missile concentration which would be brought up without Israeli interference under cover of the ceasefire. In short, what were the ninety days designed to promote: an EgyptianIsraeli effort at peace, or a SovietEgyptian deployment for a more effective war?
108.	Decisive reassurance on this question was found for us in that part of the American peace initiative which provided for a 'standstill' in an agreed area on each side of the Suez Canal ceasefire line. The purpose was to stabilize the local military balance, so that our Governments could go forward in easy mind to negotiate, without fear lest their security would be undermined during the talks. And the standstill, more than any other part of the United States peace initiative, supported our cautious hope that the United Arab Republic might be ready for an authentic peace effort, and not merely for a maneuver designed to prepare a new phase of war.
109.	In the early days of August we were informed by the United States that the United Arab Republic, with the support of the Soviet Union, had given agreement and endorsement to the following pro visions. This is the text of the standstill agreement:
'(a) Israel and the United Arab Republic will observe a ceasefire effective at 2200 hours GMT Friday 7 August;
'(ft) Both sides will stop all incursions and all firing on the ground and in the air across the ceasefire lines;
'(c) Both sides will refrain from changing the military status quo within the zones extending 50 kilometers to the east and to the west of the ceasefire line. Neither side will introduce or construct any new military installations in these zones. Activities within the zones will be limited to the maintenance of existing installations at their present sites and positions'' the maintenance of existing (installations at their present sites and positions 4 'and to the rotation and supply of forces presently within the zones;
'(d) For the purpose of verifying observance of the ceasefire, each side will rely on its own national means, including reconnaissance aircraft which will be free to operate without interference up to 10 kilometers from the ceasefire line on its own side of the line;
'(e) Each side may avail itself as appropriate of all United Nations machinery in reporting alleged violations to each other of the ceasefire and of the military standstill;
'(0 Both sides will abide by the Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War and will accept the assistance of the International Committee of the Red Cross in carrying out their obligations under that Convention.'
110.	It was to this that we agreed. And I draw special attention to the phrases:
'Neither side will introduce or construct any new military installations in these zones. Activities within will be limited to the maintenance of existing installations at their present sites and positions.'
111.	Not a single hour passed between Egypt's acceptance of that agreement and its violation of it. Within a few days those violations had been physically ascertained not only by Israel, but by the Government which sponsored the peace initiative. At the very time when the Israeli Cabinet was hopefully formulating its approach to the forthcoming peace talks, the missile buildup became conspicuously massive and intense. It is going forward to this very day. In the 'standstill' area, which is fifty kilometers west of the Canal, but mostly within an area thirty kilometer of the Canal, at least twenty- SAM2 and SAM3 batteries, many of them operational, have been introduced. Tens of additional missiles have been advanced into that zone. This has been made possible by Israel's observance of the ceasefire. Rarely has there been a more perfidious violation of an international agreement through the exploitation of the good faith and pacific intention of the other side. I have circulated to delegations this morning, a graphic representation comparing the position which should exist under the 7 August agreement with that existing a few days ago, a situation created by headlong violation.
112.	I now come to analyze the implications of this development.
113.	First, through Israel's acceptance of the ceasefire standstill agreement the United Arab Republic has achieved a substantial and illicit change of the military situation to its advantage.
114.	Secondly, in these conditions Israel would be negotiating under the intimidating effects of a growing threat to its forces along the ceasefire line, and therefore to its national security.
115.	Thirdly, there has been a collapse of confidence in the validity of Egypt's pledge. The proposed peace talks, after all, would be designed to produce an agreement, on the strength of which Israel would withdraw on the establishment of peace to secure, recognized and agreed boundaries which are not yet determined, but which would be determined in the peace negotiations. The object of the talks would be agreement. But what would be the worth or weight of a new agreement negotiated and concluded while an existing agreement is being torn cynically to shreds. Thus, the violation of the standstill agreement has cast an anticipatory shadow on the validity of any peace agreement that we hope to conclude. This is, in the last resort, the gravest result of all. The question, what binding force will a peace agreement have, overshadows every other question affecting the Middle East in future.
116.	Fourthly, the standstill agreement was not only accepted by the United Arab Republic; it was also endorsed by the Soviet Union, which, as I have said, mans many of the missile bases. Therefore, the violation of that agreement with Soviet acquiescence is a major international event. Its repercussions go far beyond the Middle East; they affect the crucial issues of peace and security in other continents of the world. They shed a disturbing light on Soviet policy everywhere. Member States in all continents would do well to take this to heart and mind.
117.	In making a firm stand for the integrity of agreements we defend an international interest wider than our own. It is still our desire and policy to explore the terms of a final peace by discussions under Ambassador Jarring's auspices in accordance with our statement of 4 August. In a dialog on peace we shall have much to say and to propose for the common benefit of our region. I must add, in frankness, that even when the violations are corrected, the memory of them will not swiftly vanish from our minds and hearts. A new burden has been laid on the eventual negotiating process which, at best, will be complex, arduous and long. When we reflect on our experience with the hopes and expectations of 1957 and with this latest incident, we become fortified in our resolve to insist that all peace engagements be direct, explicit, signed and sealed in the most precise contractual form. Israel is ready to resume discussions under Ambassador Jarring's auspices as soon as the violations are rectified and the situation prevailing on the day of the ceasefire restored.
118.	The Egyptian violation of the ceasefire agreement is only one of the obstacles which now impede progress towards peace. Others have come into sharp relief during the hectic events of the past few days. The Palestinian Arabs on both sides of the Jordan are in urgent need of peace. They have been the primary victims of the hostile policies whereby neighboring Arab States have for twenty-two years sought to prevent the establishment of peaceful and constructive relations between Israel and the Arab States. Palestinian Arabs, west of the river Jordan, are at this very time creating new processes of coexistence and commerce between themselves and the Israeli people. Their situation in recent days has been in sharp contrast with the immense havoc which came upon their kinsmen east of the Jordan in the recent fighting. No constructive interests of Palestinian Arabs can be served by the small gangs commanded by Arafat, Habash and others whose ideology consists of nothing except the prevention of peace between Israel and the Arab States. As we watched the torrents of shells, grenades and bullets pouring from and into streets and homes across the river Jordan last week, we could not fail to reflect what the fate of every Israeli home would be if our nation's security were not maintained and defended with the utmost tenacity and zeal.
119.	Let us have a frank understanding of what every one of the Palestine terrorist organizations portends. There is no distinction between the means they use and the aims they seek. The means and the aims are equally to be condemned. What is the aim? The aim is to fulfill an exclusive fantasy under which Israel would have no existence in the Middle East as a State embodying its specific Jewish heritage and its particular national and social vocation. Their doctrine is based on the wild absurdity that there can ever be a Middle East without a State of Israel at its heart and centre. They turn away in flight from the central truth that Israel is organic to the past, the present and the future of the Middle East. The Arab nation has a very large place in the Middle Eastern region, but it has no monopoly on the right to statehood, independence, sovereignty and specific national identity. The Middle East is a concept which cannot be exhaustively understood in Arab terms alone. In 1970 Israel's statehood is not something to be explained, defended, or submitted to approval or dissent. It is something to be proclaimed as an absolute and inexorable reality, deep rooted and authentic, on a level of absolute equality with the statehood, sovereignty and national identity of any nation, great or small, old or young, represented in this hall. We do not seek what is called 'recognition of Israel's right to exist', for that right is independent of any recognition of it. What we seek is a reciprocal recognition by the Arab States and Israel of each other's right to peaceful life and unreserved sovereignty. In denying this axiomatic right, the terrorist organizations commit the most disruptive heresy at work in the life of our age. There are now fourteen Arab sovereign States, with a population of a hundred million, an area of four million square miles, and unlimited wealth and opportunity. Facing them alone in the scales of equity is the small State of Israel. There is, therefore, only one nation which stands or fails in history by the way in which this conflict is resolved. By its solitude and uniqueness, Israel's secure existence is the overriding moral imperative in this dispute. International peace demands an equitable distribution not only of wealth and material resources but also of sovereignty and national freedom. To suggest a distribution whereby all Arabs must be sovereign everywhere and all Jews nowhere is to fall into an abyss of paradox and discrimination.
120.	So much for the aims of the terrorist groups. The aim is politicize the murder of a state and the method is piracy and murder. The moral quality of the struggle is illustrated by assaults on housewives in a supermarket, on students in a cafeteria, on humble citizens, Jews and Arabs, in crowded markets and bus stations, on innocent travelers in vulnerable civil aircraft. No other political movement in our days has chosen its victims so exclusively amongst defenseless, unarmed civilians in many lands. Therefore, it is a movement not of liberation but of enslavement. Its aim is not to win freedom for the Arab nation, whose freedom is amply and lavishly assured, but to liquidate the national liberation which another nation, the most ancient of nations, has already achieved. Such honourable words as 'liberation', 'resistance' and 'commando' have no application and have never before been applied to attempts to liquidate a lawful sovereignty, to compound the Nazi assault on Jewish survival and to wage a campaign of indiscriminate attack against civilians in the Middle East and elsewhere.
121.	Having failed in their assaults on Israel, the Fatah organization, the 'Palestine Liberation Organization' and other kindred groups have directed their main threat against the independence and sovereignty of Arab States. Early this year they were hard at work attempting to turn Lebanon away from its peaceful vocation and to subvert its specific national personality. Last week we saw the most recent of many attempts to bring about anarchy and disintegration in Jordan in order to shatter any hope of peace between Israel and the Arabs nations.
122.	Arab Governments which are the victims of these acts are, ironically, often the sponsors of them. The terrorist groups do not spring out of the empty air. They do not work in a vacuum. They could not exist, still less function, without the shelter, support, endorsement, financial aid, arms, training facilities and territorial base supplied to them by sovereign Arab States. Nor could they endanger life and limb outside the Middle East if certain Governments, especially in Europe, did not grant them excessive indulgence and immunity. Surely the time has come for the world community to turn in wrath not only against the specific outrage of aerial piracy but also against the other activities of the terrorist groups. All these activities, without exception, violate the principles which the signatories of the Charter, including its Arab signatories, have pledged themselves to defend. Any action which aims to destroy or violate a legitimate sovereignty is a form of international hijacking. Therefore it is important that these acts be resisted. They were successfully resisted ten days ago by those who foiled the hijacking of an El A1 aircraft by using righteous force against an odious pair of pirates. They were resisted by Jordan, which but for that resistance would have lost title to be regarded as a sovereign authority. The main adversaries of peace suffered another setback when the invasion of Jordan by regular armored units of the Syrian 
Army was repelled. The Syrian invasion of Jordan was too brief for its full implications to be seized. Here we have a member of the Security Council violating an international frontier in order to impose its will and policy upon a neighboring State. A Syrian representative at the United Nations, attempting publicly to justify this aggression, has taken refuge in a doctrine which denies the international character of boundaries between States of kindred cultures.
123.	The General Assembly will recall that after the Soviet aggression against Czechoslovakia two years ago Soviet representatives asserted that the boundaries between socialist States did not have a full international character, so that the unprovoked invasion of territory across them had a kind of domestic intimacy. Something of that kind was asserted by Syria last week. The doctrine is that, if two States have a similar ideology or language or national culture, it is not the business of the world community if one of them invades the other without provocation. There are dozens of
States represented here which would be well advised to reflect deeply on the consequences for them if a doctrine of 'invasion through kinship' were condoned.
124.	Israel followed recent events in Jordan with vigilance, restraint and a keen sense of the developing human tragedy. We could not have been indifferent to violent changes in the regional balance which would have put Israel's security in jeopardy. But it is for Arab Governments to determine their regimes and institutional structure. Israel will never move its forces in any cause except its own legitimate security. We hope that the scars of battle will be healed in Jordan and that a concerted humanitarian effort will be made to allay the vast suffering of which we have been the close witnesses in recent days. The trucks bearing medical aid dispatched by the Israeli authorities eastward across the Jordan illustrate how humane solidarities should prevail over political and military tensions. We hope that the Jordan Government will not make the error of encouraging or condoning activity by the terror groups against Israel across the ceasefire lines. This would be contrary to Jordan's international obligations, including the ceasefire, and would of course encounter Israel's firm resistance.
125.	The capacity to repeat error is revealed in the communication which the Arab Governments and the terrorist organizations signed in Cairo yesterday. There is not in that document a single, peaceful, civilized, lawful word. The talk is not of peace but of victory over an enemy ind the liberation of Israel, which means of course its extinction. That document violates the engagement which the United Arab Republic and Jordan made to Ambassador Jarring, promising to establish a just and lasting peace with Israel and to acknowledge its sovereignty and independence. The question is: which document commits the policy of those two States?
126.	Many Members have spoken here about the necessity for international action against the hijacking of aircraft. In Israel's view an agenda item on that subject would only be of value if international law came out reinforced. It is not enough to exhort parties to adopt the Tokyo Convention  or a new Convention expressive of existing law and morality. We should recall that the cooperation and States in the struggle against piracy preceded all other developments in the realm of international law. The pirate was regarded as the enemy of the human race, hostis humani generis. He was an outlaw from human society and every nation had the right and duty to apprehend and punish him with full vigor. Over a century ago, an outstanding maritime judge in Britain, Lord Stowell, expressed the current contemporary law and morality as follows:
'With professed pirates there is no state of peace.
They are the enemies of every country and at all
times and therefore are universally subject to the
extreme rights of war.'
127.	It follows that aerial piracy, which involves even more horror and peril than piracy at sea, should never be indulged, condoned, or, above all, rewarded. A firm attempt should be made to secure the unconditional release of all captives. Physical methods of prevention should be adopted without limitation or reserve. What a victory would have been won for international order if all the aircraft assaulted on 6 September had been defended as effectively as was the El A1 airliner and if all the pirates had met a similar fate. But responsibility does not lie on the terrorists alone. Some Arab Governments have given practical and moral support to successful pirates. Thus, in July 1970, we find President Nasser of Egypt himself extending a welcome to men who had hijacked a Greek aircraft and to criminals released from a prison to which Greek law had properly consigned them. At meetings last year of the United Nations General Assembly and the Organization of African Unity, Arab delegations prevented the unanimous adoption of resolutions which would strongly have condemned hijackers and required firm measures to insure their extradition and punishment. When an Arab pirate lands in certain Arab countries, he is more likely to get fuel facilities, praise and reward than arrest and punishment. The recent experience and the present debate can only be useful if condemnation is unequivocal and even then only if it leads to practical measures. I have in mind that the General Assembly might endorse the proposition which was recently made by the United States in the International Civil Aviation Organization, calling for joint international action 'to suspend all international civil air transport services to and from any State which, after the unlawful seizure of an aircraft, detains passengers, crew and aircraft contrary to the Tokyo Convention (including the destruction of such aircraft) or any State which fails to extradite or prosecute persons responsible for such acts of unlawful seizure'. Since then we have seen other drafts. The point is that only measures which lead to practical and automatic action have validity.
128.	The avoidance of reward for hijackers sometimes requires the maintenance of strong nerves. At an early stage in the recent episode there was a precipitate tendency to offer the release of convicted hijackers as a recompense for the liberation of innocent hostages. This would have saved present victims but it would have endangered other travelers on whom the released hijackers would try their skill again. It is satisfactory that this course has not been followed, and that the four countries whose aircraft or citizens had been kidnapped accepted the principle advocated by the United Kingdom and the United States, according to which solidarity should be maintained and each airline and Government would be responsible for all passengers without distinction. Faced by attitudes of principle and strengthening nerves, the hijackers understood the uselessness of their victory and gave up its fruits to the Jordanian Government and the Egyptian Embassy, which we hope will act with correct promptitude.
129.	But the release of hostages who were wantonly submitted to hardship and peril should not dull the edge of international vigilance. Israel proposes international action along four lines:
| (a) To increase security measures at airports and ! in aircraft. Israel is prepared to cooperate by sharing the knowledge and experience that it has accumulated ! in this sphere;
(b)	To call upon The Hague Conference that will convene in December 1970 to adopt the proposed convention, and to strengthen it so that the illegal capture of an aircraft, its passengers and crew will be considered an international crime calling for maximum punishment;
(c)	To establish sanctions against States that aid or provide asylum to hijackers or criminals who attack aircraft. These sanctions should include: cessation of aerial communications with the States which aid hijackers, and withholding of services from the national carrier of a State that aids or provides asylum to those who hijack or attack aircraft;
id) To call for the establishment of a special body that will deal continuously with acts of hijacking or attacks on the international level.
130.	But what about the larger issue of peace? Before we fall into despair let us recall that there are no irreconcilable conflicts in history. The ArabIsraeli conflict, for all its rhetorical bitterness, has had no results comparable in absolute or relative terms with the carnage and mass suffering of many other wars.
131.	But peace has too often been considered by international bodies in semantic formal terms, and too little in terms of human realities. It is not enough that Egypt, Israel, Lebanon and Jordan should agree on a form of words; such agreement may even be an illusion if it conceals a wide gap in intention and interpretation. What is needed most is that they, and all concerned with their deeper interests, should have a clear vision of what our region would look like and how its people would live ones hostility was replaced by peace. The most conclusive evidence, the most conclusive hallmark of peace is the open frontier. A peaceful Middle East is a Middle East in which a man would be able to travel by road and rail from Cairo through Israel to Beirut and Amman, in which Egyptian civil aircraft could traverse Israel eastward while Israeli shipping passed unimpeded through the Suez Canal. Israeli and Arab civil aircraft would land in Cairo, Lod and Amman. Railways for the transportation of heavy goods would pass from the Suez area through Kan tarah, across the Israeli coast northward. The ports of Eilat and Aqaba would plan their expansion and development in neighborly coordination. This is not a dream. This summer 55,000 Arabs from neighboring countries visited their relatives west of the Jordan. Thousands passed from Israel and the west bank across the Jordan to remote parts of the Arab world. This year nearly half a million tourists came to Israel and an approximately similar number to Egypt. Under conditions of normality and peace, the ancient splendors and the modern amenities of our countries would attract millions more, who by their very pilgrimage would join us closer to them and to each other.
132.	In the last resort, a nation's strength and greatness will be measured not by the number of its missiles but by the quality of its scholars, scientists and technicians. Why should not Israeli and Arab doctors and scientists cooperate in the common quest for learning, visit each other's institutions, lecture to each other's students, meet face to face the opportunities and the ills which are common to our region? It was no credit to the Middle East in recent weeks when cholera disease broke out in many parts and when the appeal of the Israeli Minister of Health for cooperation with his colleagues in neighboring countries went unheeded.
133.	And the senselessness and tragedy of war are most vividly expressed in the inexcusable waste of resources. In twenty-two years the Arab States and Israel have spent more than $20,000 million for military purposes. If one-tenth of that sum had been invested in a refugee solution, the problem would have been solved long ago in a way that would have promoted economic progress in all the countries in which the resettlement was made.
134.	At the present time Egypt and Israel are spending $2,000 million every year for military purposes.
135.	It would be a delusion to believe that a formal peace agreement would be followed by a relaxation of vigilance or an abandonment of security; but there would certainly be a more rational distribution between the security and the economic needs of the signatory countries.
136.	Every year the population of the leading Arab State grows by 1 million, that is to say, by a number greater that that of those in refugee camps. In conditions of war and conflict, neither the refugee problem nor the problems of increased populations can be solved, since there is no rational use of resources for human needs. My point is that peace is not a word, it is not a juridical phrase; it is a total revolution in the meaning, style and content of life. It is not a documentary device; it is a human condition, the like of which our generation in the Middle East has never known.
137.	The question is whether Arab leadership can break loose from an obsolete routine of conflict in order to explore this prospect. It is in peace and not in violence that the Palestinian Arabs will find their true destiny. For in conditions of peace Israel's eastern neighbor would be an Arab State, a majority of whose population would be composed of Palestinian Arabs, and a majority of all the Palestinian Arabs would be citizens of that State. In other words, peace settles the problem of self-determination.
138.	What I have said has always been true of the Kingdom of Jordan, whose structure, name and regime were determined not by Israel but by its Arab citizens. But most of them are Palestinian Arab citizens. Wherever the boundary is determined in the peace agreement the Palestinian Arabs on both sides of the Jordan will find a better future than that which Arafat and Habash and the hijackers can offer them.
139.	There will always be a sizable Palestine Arab community in Israel. But this will have no negative significance when close cooperation across an open frontier exists between Israel and its eastern neighbor. The original former Palestine area the Mandated area  on both sides of the Jordan will accommodate two States, Israel and an Arab State, while the area regains its natural economic unity and advances towards new forms of integration. That, at any rate, is what Israel means by peace. If we have a clear vision of our aims, it will not be difficult to work backwards from the desired result towards the process that leads towards it.
140.	In the territorial negotiation, Israel's aim will be the determination of new, secure, agreed boundaries, offering a firmer security than the old armistice lines could ever provide. In short, there are no solutions without peace, and there are no problems which peace cannot resolve.
141.	The deep humane issues which preoccupy Israel are not only those which revolve around the Middle Eastern conflict. Our Jewish destiny and responsibility inspire our concern for the plight of small Jewish minorities still lingering in Arab lands, held as hostages, forbidden to depart, discriminated against, humiliated, their property confiscated, their communal and cultural life paralyzed. The hard facts are now well known and there has been a broad international echo in recent years. Yet the suffering and misery continue and in some countries have become more intense. We therefore welcome the recent reiteration by the Secretary General, in his address on 15 June to the Royal Commonwealth Society in London, of his call for the evacuation of Jews from Arab countries and of the conviction, expressed in the introduction to his report to last year's session of the General Assembly,  that the United Nations has a moral obligation to act for their rescue. I hope that States Members of the United Nations will join the call to save these doomed communities.
142.	Of very deep concern to enlightened world opinion is the grave situation of Jews in the Soviet Union. Year after year, the representatives of Israel and other Member States have raised their voices against the discrimination to which Soviet Jews are subjected, in particular the denial of the right of those who desire to join their kinsmen in Israel. In recent years ominous antiSemitic propaganda in the Soviet Union has been intensified under the cloak of a campaign against Zionism, which is the Jewish people's liberation movement. Thousands of slanderous articles and documents, reminiscent of medieval times, have been circulated by the information media controlled by the Soviet authorities.
143.	The plight of Jews in the USSR is dramatically illustrated by the appeals for permission to leave for Israel which Jews from all parts of the Soviet Union addressed to Heads of the Soviet Government, to the Government of Israel, to the Secretary-General of the
United Nations and to others. Those appeals, giving the full names and the addresses of the signatories, have been published in the international press; they speak movingly of the suffering of separated families and of thew longing to unite their lot with the mainstream of the Jewish people. Some of the signatories have been arrested; their only crime is a desire to emigrate to Israel, which does not infringe any Soviet law. Indeed, Prime Minister Kosygin made a public statement in December 1966 promising that no obstacles would be placed in the way of Soviet Jews who wish to be united with their families in Israel.
144.	Humanity and justice call upon the Soviet Government to recognize the human rights of its Jewish citizens and to permit them freely to exercise those rights.
145.	In conclusion, let me recall that much of the work of the United Nations in its first twenty-five years has revolved around this modern encounter between the national revolutions of Israel in its small State and of the Arab nation in its expanse of multiple sovereignty. Whether the anniversary year will open a better act in the drama depends less on the General Assembly's debates than on the initiatives and decisions of Middle Eastern Governments. Israel will maintain the policy on which it decided on 4 August and reiterated on 6 September. It will fulfill its special role in the advancement of developing countries through which it has already offered training and development techniques to 12,000 future leaders of emergent societies in eighty lands. It will raise its voice and hand for the equality of nations and against discrimination and the remnants of colonialism. Above all, it will keep its mind and heart open to the prospect of a negotiated peace. Its people has the strength, the tenacity and the will to withstand the violent forces which assail its life and threaten its future. But its deepest aspiration is to deploy its energies in the service of a peaceful order of relations in the Middle East.
146.	The key to that future lies in a negotiation explicitly directed to the establishment of peace, and the key is now in Arab, and particularly in Egyptian, hands. It can be opened by restoring the original ceasefire situation and by treading the road of negotiation. I am prepared to use my presence here for talks with heads of Arab delegations on the establishment of peace and on the creation of an atmosphere and conditions in which a fruitful negotiation can take place. There is no rational or defensible reason for refusing such an opportunity. We do the United Nations no service if we confine ourselves to public debate and neglect the normal contacts without which no international problem has ever been or will ever be resolved.
147.	Mankind may either have a peaceful future or no future at all. Our 126 Governments will all have a share in deciding how the choice is made. If we can recapture the youthful spirit which moved the United Nations twenty-five years ago, we may yet convert past dreams into reality and present disappointments into enduring hopes.
"
25,1970,ISL," Mr. President, allow me, on behalf of the Icelandic delegation as well as personally, to offer you our warmest congratulations on your unanimous election to the high office of the President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your election stands as a well-earned tribute to your great personal and professional qualifications. With your extensive knowledge and your long experience in the affairs of the United Nations, I am confident that you will lead this anniversary session of 'peace, justice and progress' to fruitful accomplishments.
2.	I wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to your predecessor in the presidential chair, Her Excellency Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph, who presided over the last session with gracious dignity and great skill. I pay tribute to the fine leadership she showed in directing the deliberations of the last session of this Assembly.
3.	Allow me, furthermore, to use this opportunity to extend thanks to the SecretaryGeneral, U Thant, for outstanding service during his term in office. His performance in the high position of SecretaryGeneral and his devotion to the maintenance of world peace is recognized by all member nations. It is to be regretted if U Thant is not to remain in his position for another term. I very much hope that he will continue to work actively for the cause of world peace.
4.	When the United Nations was established 25 years ago, the idea was to have the Organization contribute to the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means and to take collective measures to prevent and
remove threats to the peace to ensure in particular that armed force should not be used. Allow me to congratulate the Organization on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary and to give expression to our sincere thanks for the extensive activities of the Organization. Furthermore, I should like to express the wish that the Organization will in the future be true to its aims and that it will prove successful in carrying out the tasks originally given to it in the Charter. Sometimes it is said that the United Nations has failed to solve world problems. Admittedly, it is true that the Organization has not succeeded in solving all problems. That is certainly not strange and the reason is first and foremost that the Organization does not have executive power, as has often been pointed out. However, I would say that the Organization has succeeded, in spite of difficult circumstances, to solve many problems.
5.	In Iceland we have an old Nordic proverb saying: 'You settle a land with laws and you lay it waste with lawlessness.' The meaning of this proverb is that the subjects of a society should establish laws and regulations on their behavior, and that these laws and regulations should be followed. In particular, one should ensure that force shall not be used, and one should always abide by the laws. In the community of nations, of course, the same rule or law should be observed, and I would consider it only natural that the United Nations should be powerful enough to enforce international law. But it has to be admitted that there are many hindrances and real difficulties, which have to be overcome if the United Nations is to succeed fully in accomplishing its aims. One could mention many examples of this.
6.	The most recent example, and the one that has caused great anxiety on the international scene, is that relatively small but violent groups of fanatics have taken as hostages altogether innocent people, both as passengers on civil aircraft and even representatives of foreign States on legal assignments. These victims of violence have been kept in captivity for the purpose of blackmail to force acceptance of outrageous demands of a more or less illegal nature. And the criminal commandos have threatened the hostages with injury and even death if their demands are not satisfied. I consider that all relations with nations that tolerate such kidnapping will be imperiled. Some measures will have to be found to prevent this violence. On the other hand, one cannot overlook the fact that many of those who have taken these violent actions live in great difficulties and suffer even injustice, so that it is not by any means unnatural that they resort to desperate actions. But one cannot under any circumstances
tolerate this. Their problems will have to be solved by other means. Violence serves no useful purposes but will have grave consequences for those who resort to it. Something will have to be done. These hijackers have world public opinion against them, and therefore the matter should be more manageable.
7.	In my opinion, even if there are many things that can stand improvement, and many problems that still remain unsolved, the United Nations can look back upon its activities during the first quarter of a century with considerable satisfaction, and it can look to the next quarter of a century with optimism and confidence that many problems, which have not yet been solved, will gradually be solved.
8.	This past year, since the last General Assembly, events have taken place that give good hope for the future. First, I should like to mention the situation in Europe. Europe has long been the biggest and bloodiest battleground in the world, and the peace of the world depends to a large extent on the success of cooperation between European States. So far there has been great tension between East and West and the German problem has caused many difficulties. Recently the Soviet Union and Germany concluded a nonaggression treaty  and talks have begun between the two German States. Whatever the concrete results of those talks, those are steps in the right direction, and we hope that those talks that have now commenced will lead to positive results.
9.	East Germany has expressed its wish to gain admittance to the United Nations, either as a full Member or as an observer. However, I think that it is the opinion of many governments in Europe that the time has not arrived to start considering this question, now that direct talks have begun between the two German States. For the time being it will be better and more conducive to the lessening of tension to wait and see what will possibly be the results of these talks, if they continue, as we hope they will do.
10.	In another part of the world the situation seemed to have also advanced to the talking stage, whatever the results of these talks will be, and I am referring to the ArabIsraeli conflict. But in these very last few days intraArab fighting has broken out in Jordan and the world has watched the violent actions of the Palestinian guerillas. In the Middle East the situation for the past few years has been such that one is correct in calling it a war situation, even if the war has not raged fully all the time and even if the war has been primarily directed against military objects and ordinary citizens have, for the most part, been left in peace. One will have to consider it a great accomplishment that the ArabIsraeli war has ceased for the time being and that conversations to solve the basic conflict of the Middle East are hopefully about to begin through the good offices of Ambassador Jarring, the United Nations mediator. However, what I said about the German talks is also true of these talks. Today it is not possible to say what the results will be, but as long as talks continue, one is allowed to hope that some results will be attained. But it was not my intention to commence discussion here in the General Assembly about the Middle East conflict because such a discussion will not contribute to the possibilities of positive results, at this stage anyhow. The so-called 'Rogers peace plan' is considered by many to hold the possibilities of an agreement and it seems to be quite obvious for all to try, to the utmost, to find out whether this is so or not.
11.	The third area of conflict, which has caused anxiety during past sessions of the General Assembly, is the war in VietNam. Also in this matter, events have taken place since the last Assembly that one has to consider to be steps in the right direction. One of these is the United States decision to withdraw a great number of troops from SouthEast Asia. Hopefully this could result in diminishing the conflict. Such a de escalation will be welcomed but the same thing applies here as with the two other matters I mentioned. One cannot say definitely what the future development will be. In all three cases one can, however, say that developments during the last year seem to hold possibilities which could become real opportunities.
12.	One cannot say the same thing about the fourth and last tension area that I should like to mention in general terms. Apparently there has been no change in the situation in South Africa and Namibia, which has been discussed extensively during past sessions of the General Assembly. South Africa sticks to the policy of apartheid and South Africa continues to control Namibia notwithstanding, in both those cases, repeated resolutions of the United Nations to the contrary. This reminds us of the most obvious weakness of the United Nations, that is, that resolutions by the United Nations are totally disregarded by the parties who are dissatisfied with those resolutions and consider themselves powerful enough to disregard them with impunity.
13.	The executive power is lacking, as I have repeatedly pointed out from this rostrum. This state of affairs will have to change if the United Nations is to accomplish its aim*.
14.	The primary role of the United Nations is and will be the prevention of armed conflicts and the maintenance of international peace and security. But our Organization has other aims as well. On earlier occasions in my interventions in the general debate of the General Assembly I have had the honor to discuss also the second main objective of the United Nations the promotion of social progress and economic advancement of all peoples in larger freedom. In particular, I have drawn attention to certain aspects of this major objective of the United Nations which are of vital concern to the Icelandic nation, especially those aspects of our social and economic tasks which have to do with the sea.
15.	Being an island nation in the middle of the North Atlantic, the Icelandic people base their livelihood primarily on the fisheries around Iceland. This dependence on the living resources of the sea is best demonstrated by citing two figures. Over 35 per cent of our gross national product is exported and of these exports about 90 per cent are fish or fishery products of one kind or another. From these figures one will realize how important the fishing industry is to the national economy of Iceland. Economic activity centers around the fisheries. Almost all necessities of life have to be imported into Iceland, and these imports are financed by exporting fishery products.
16.	Therefore, conservation and rational management of the fish stocks in the North Atlantic Ocean are truly of vital interest to the Icelandic people. And in the sea around Iceland, above the country's clearly distinguishable continental shelf, there are invaluable fishing banks and nursery grounds upon whose preservation depends the livelihood and continued economic development of the Icelandic nation.
17.	The Government of Iceland has* for many years actively followed a policy of conservation of the living resources of the sea. And because of Iceland's special situation, the Government has claimed its right to extend its fisheries jurisdiction beyond the territorial waters to reserve the fisheries in the contiguous zone for the exclusive utilization of the coastal population.
18.	Such special situations relating to coastal fisher as of exceptional nature have been recognized in general terms by the international community. The first Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1958 adopted a resolution on the subject. And the particular case of Iceland was recognized in 1961 by two of the biggest deep-sea fishing nations which have a special interest in the North Atlantic, when the United Kingdom and Germany accepted the last extension by Iceland of its fisheries jurisdiction out to twelve miles from straight base lines, especially agreed upon by the parties concerned. The recognition of Iceland's unilateral extension of the exclusive fisheries jurisdiction in the contiguous zone was made in view of the exceptional dependence of the Icelandic nation upon coastal fisheries for its livelihood and economic development.
19.	On 5 May 1959 the Icelandic Parliament passed an often-quoted resolution on the extension of the fisheries jurisdiction to cover the whole of th ? continental shelf. Since then that resolution has constituted for the Government of Iceland its working instructions in these matters. As far as Iceland is concerned, it is the Government's firm conviction that conservation and utilization, not only of the mineral resources in the seabed and the subsoil of its continental shelf but also the living resources in the waters above the continental shelf, shall be recognized internationally as subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and control of Iceland.
20.	The conservation measures taken in the North Atlantic have undeniably been of great value in many cases, but they have proven to be insufficient. Increased fishing efforts in the North Atlantic have resulted in overexploitation of certain fish stocks, some of which stand in danger of depletion. In my statements in general debates at past sessions of the
General Assembly I have repeatedly pointed out this danger and called for urgent measures to prevent the disastrous consequences of overfishing. The reduction in catches both in total catches and particularly in catches per unit of effort of some species in the North Atlantic is indeed so severe that plans are being made to limit the fisheries by strict quota systems. But the experience with these quota systems has been rather unsatisfactory so that more effective measures will have to be taken. And due regard will have to be given to the special requirements of countries or territories whose people are overwhelmingly dependent on coastal fisheries for their livelihood and economic development. People who base practically their whole economic existence on the living resources of the sea will have to be granted preferential rights to the fisheries located outside their present national jurisdiction.
21.	We have already had a debate in the General Assembly on the complex set of problems in relation to the sea, all of which are now gathered under agenda item 25. Much work will have to be done by the First Committee. In the spirit of the ideals embodied in the Charter, I am confident that the Committee's discussion will result in practical proposals taking into consideration the interests of all the nations of the world, large and small. The views of the Icelandic Government on specific issues will be explained in detail in the Committee as they come up during its deliberations. Let me briefly touch upon only the main headings.
22.	First of all, the Icelandic Government considers that much useful work has already been done by the United Nations on the progressive development of international law regarding many aspects of the sea. However, many problems remain unsolved. Although constituting different aspects, these are all integral parts of the vast field of international maritime law. Progress in that vast field will have to be gradually arrived at by considering the different aspects of the law of the sea, not in isolation but all together since they are all in all interrelated and linked one to another. Much coordination will need to be done, and, therefore, my Government welcomes the initiative taken by the delegation of Malta in this respect in the Economic and Social Council last July.
23.	With regard to the question whether a third United Nations conference on the law of the sea should be convened and what should be the scope of its mandate, I should like to sum up the views of the Government of Iceland as follows.
24.	We are in favor of convening a conference on the law of the sea whose mandate should be sufficiently broad to cover all aspects of the rights of the coastal State in areas adjacent to its coasts. We maintain that coastal States are entitled to establish the limits of their coastal jurisdiction within a reasonable distance, having regard to geographical, geological, economic and other relevant considerations. We realize that many States consider that a limit of twelve miles is sufficient for their purposes, although, in point of fact, coastal jurisdiction varies now from three to 200 miles. In the special situation where a nation is overwhelmingly dependent upon its coastal resources a limit of 12 miles is not sufficient. In the case of Iceland, jurisdiction and control over the continental shelf and the waters above the shelf are reasonable and just and should be recognized by the international community.
25.	It is our earnest hope that the forthcoming conference will be able to serve the really progressive development of international law.
26.	Useful work has been done although progress has been rather slow by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the SeaBed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction. The Government of Iceland notes with satisfaction that agreement seems to have been reached on a most important and fundamental component of an eventual declaration of principles with regard to the seabed and the ocean floor, that the exploration of the area and the exploitation of its resources shall be carried out for the benefit of mankind as a whole, irrespective of the geographic location of States whether landlocked or coastal taking into particular consideration the needs and interests of the developing countries. Of course the hard reality remains that an agreement has not been reached on the question of the definition of the area of the seabed and the ocean floor; or, if one wishes to approach the problem from another direction, the question of delimitation of the continental shelf remains open. That question will have to be solved with due regard to the rights of coastal States to intervene in sea areas adjacent to the areas of national jurisdiction in cases where the coastline or related interests are in grave and imminent danger because of activities on the seabed or the ocean floor.
27.	Cognizant of the hard realities of the situation, the First Committee should attempt to explore all possibilities for advancement of the work of the seabed Committee in step with the development of other aspects of the law of the sea.
28.	The same is also true as regards the banning of military uses of the seabed and the ocean floor. The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has worked out proposals on a treaty barring the emplacement of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed.3 That proposal is to be welcomed and, with the approval of the General Assembly, that treaty should be opened for signature as soon as possible.
29.	Yet another aspect of the law of the sea is the prevention and control of pollution of the marine environment. The Government of Iceland feels that it is now imperative upon the United Nations to draw up and open for signature an international convention on the prevention of sea pollution from whatever sources. To be effective such a convention should establish the obligations and liabilities of States as regards all pollution adversely affecting the living resources of the sea. It would be highly appropriate, in the opinion of the Government of Iceland, to work out an international convention on the prevention of sea pollution in time for it to be opened for signature at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, in Stockholm in 1972, if possible.
30.	Finally, there is one more activity of the United Nations in questions regarding the sea that I should like to mention. The SecretaryGeneral has now completed the report he was called upon to give in resolution 2413 (XXIII) on the exploitation and conservation of living marine resources.4 The Secretariat is to be highly commended for the excellence of this report, and now it is incumbent on the General Assembly to decide upon further action on the basis of the report. As I have already explained, this is a matter in which my country is vitally interested and the Government of Iceland will, at the appropriate time, have proposals to make regarding further actions on this problem in the United Nations framework. Conservation and rational exploitation of the living resources of the sea are of vital interest not only to Iceland, but to all the Members of the United Nations and, indeed, the world community as a whole, if the war against hunger is to be waged successfully.
31.	We appreciate the fact that many nations have already at this stage the same or similar views on these questions as we do. After considering the matter they have adopted the same attitude as we now have. I mention the nations of South America and, indeed, also North America, and many of the nations oi'Africa and Asia. It would be desirable for all these nations to come to an agreement on a common position so that their views will be accepted at the eventual third conference on the law of the sea.



"
25,1970,KHM,"4.	 Before I begin this speech I should like first of all on behalf of my delegation to express our sorrow and condolences on the occasion of the death of Ambassador Ramani of Malaysia.
5.	On behalf of the Cambodian delegation, Mr. President, I am particularly pleased to join with those other speakers who have spoken before me in offering to you our warmest congratulations on the occasion of your election to the high office of President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly. This election is specially significant because, through your distinguished person, it is a tribute to the work done traditionally by the Norwegian people for peace and international cooperation. I am sure that, thanks to your long experience, your spirit of fairness and impartiality, the work of this session will be conducted in a harmonious spirit and an atmosphere of understanding and cooperation.
6.	It is also a pleasant duty for me to pay special tribute to the President of the twenty-fourth session, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph, whose competence and political wisdom were very much appreciated.
7.	It is also a pleasure for me to address, on behalf of the people and Government of Cambodia, my most sincere congratulations to U Thant who, for more than a decade now, has spared neither time nor effort to preserve international peace and security and to promote justice and prosperity in the world. The Cambodian people also sees in the personality of the SecretaryGeneral a man of peace and great Buddhist wisdom and we believe firmly that the blessing of Buddha will always accompany U Thant in his work of goodwill.
8.	At this commemorative session of the General Assembly we must recognize that the appeal contained in the United Nations Charter for peace and international cooperation is quite as necessary and urgent now as it was twenty-five years ago. Therefore, it is the duty of all of us meeting here today to try to find all possible ways and means capable of leading to a sincere and equitable achievement of the aspirations which were expressed so solemnly and with such faith at San Francisco.

9.	Notwithstanding its shortcomings, the United Nations continues to enjoy a definite measure of influence in international events. Men of goodwill see in 
it a guardian of peace and international security and a tireless promoter of an era of peace and progress in justice for mankind as a whole.
10.	In countless fields this Organization has scored real successes. It can also be seen that a glimmer of hope is beginning to emerge in the disarmament talks. In this connexion, I am happy to announce that my Government is now going to join the vast majority of States which have accepted the provisions of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)].
11.	My Government is also happy to welcome the initiatives taken at this session to strengthen international peace and security. As a peace-loving people, victim of a foreign invasion, it is, of course, our keenest desire to see brought about as soon as possible the withdrawal of the forces of aggression and the restoration of peace in Cambodia.
12.	I shall not go into the details of the events that have occurred recently in my country. The United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, were duly informed of these developments. However, let me present a broad picture of the actual situation and the international position of Cambodia, a picture which was in fact drawn by the Prime Minister, General Lon Nol, in an open letter addressed to all heads of State on 3 September 1970, from which I shall now quote:
'The aggression against neutral, peace-loving Cambodia was unleashed according to a well established plan by the North VietNamese, VietCong and PathetLao invaders.
'A veritable silent invasion of our territory, since 1967 and during 1969 in particular, preceded this aggression. Aware of the implicit danger to our true neutrality, and justly outraged by this growing infiltration of VietCong and North VietNamese forces on Khmer territory and the offenses committed by their troops, who acted like masters on our soil and against our population, our people and youth on 8, 11 and 16 March 1970 reacted in popular anti VietCong and antiNorthVietnam demonstrations.
'Prince Sihanouk, who was in France at the time, came out openly in favor of his 'friends' the VietNamese communists who he himself had allowed to set themselves up illegally in all the frontier regions bordering on South VietNam, he and his entourage even having sold them parcels of our land. Enraged at the events which had taken place, he described as 'traitors' the thousands of demonstrators who had called for the withdrawal of VietCong and North VietNamese troops. It was Khmer public opinion, and particularly the youth and intellectual elite of the country, that called for the overthrow of the dictator whose policy, which was absolutely contrary to the national interest, had allowed the installation of foreign troops on our territory.
'While on this point it might be recalled that Prince Sihanouk was actually acting as a dictator, having
taken over all power since 1955, and would not brook any opposition in whatever form. Any Khmer citizen not in agreement with his dictatorial policies he described as either a 'Red' or a 'Blue', and they were compelled to silence if not actually thrown into prison or executed on his orders. His overthrow on 18 March 1970 was therefore in strict accordance with the will of the people. Virtually all the Khmers refused to endure any longer the dictatorship of Prince Sihanouk and his treachery against the national interests of our country to the advantage of the VietCong and the North VietNamese, and the abuses committed by him, his family and his entourage. His overthrow was, furthermore, perfectly legal, having been proclaimed by a unanimous vote of the National Assembly and the Council of the Kingdom meeting in Congress. The Khmer Parliament had in 1960 entrusted Prince Sihanouk with the functions of Chief of State of Cambodia, and those functions were withdrawn from him by the same procedure that had been used ten years earlier to give them to him.
'Three weeks later, on 11 April 1970, the people and youth, at a great mass demonstration, expressed their desire to see the Republic proclaimed and called for the abolition of the monarchy. Fully approving this truly justified expression of the people's will, my Government responded by lawfully preparing the change in regime desired by the Khmer people.
'Meanwhile the armed aggression by VietNamese communists against neutral, peace-loving Cambodia had already started. Our defense forces were not at all prepared to resist that aggression because of the state of weakness in which Prince Sihanouk had systematically kept them for years by deliberately refraining from providing them with the means necessary to defend our independence, neutrality and territorial integrity.
'But the inflow of large numbers of volunteers from all parts of the population made it possible to increase our manpower gradually. At the beginning, they amounted to only 30,000 men that is when, on 29 March, the aggression of the Asian communists North VietNamese, VietCong and Pathet Lao started against our country. Our defense forces now amount to 135,000 men, thanks to the ever-increasing number of volunteers, while the enemy forces, in spite of new reinforcements, have diminished considerably because of the heavy losses they suffered during their vain offenses against our capital and our principal towns. These facts about the present situation are extremely encouraging to us, and they make us certain of our final victory over the invasion forces of Asian communism.
'Those successes have taught us a valuable lesson. They have made us organize ourselves better in our struggle to repel the invaders. We have learned a lesson which has been useful to us in building a modern nation that will be truly independent and neutral. The enthusiasm and determination demonstrated by our people, our youth, our elite, our
Buddhist clergy and our army in the struggle against the enemy, and at the same time in the preparations for the advent of the republican regime, are the best evidence of our faith in victory and in the future of our nation.
'It is true that we are no longer alone, as we were in the early days of our national resistance against the North VietNamese and VietCong aggressors. Friendly countries have heeded our appeal and are providing us with generous and unconditional aid. However, the fact that we are receiving this aid, which is designed to strengthen our defenses, cannot in any way be said to commit us to this or that bloc. Out of respect for the will of the Khmer people my Government is firmly determined to keep Cambodia on the path of authentic neutrality. That is why we have not joined the SouthEast Asia Treaty Organization or any other military pact. We intend always to follow a policy of strict nonalignment.
'But that was not true of Prince Sihanouk, who deliberately went over to the side of our aggressors. That is why his phantom Government, the GRUNK, which was illegal because it was never empowered to act by the Khmer Parliament, is only a screen used by the North VietNamese, the VietCong and the PathetLao to camouflage and continue their deliberate aggression against my country. Created on 5 May 1970 that is, more than a month after the commencement of the communist aggression against Cambodia the phantom Government of Prince Sihanouk can under no circumstances claim to be neutral.
'That 'Government' is installed in the capital of a communist Power, sustained by that Power, and entirely dependent on it. It joined a military pact concluded with the support of communist China, consisting of itself, North VietNam, the VietCong and the PathetLao, at the IndoChinese communist summit which took place on Chinese territory. The former Chief of State of Cambodia clearly made it known in' his statements in Peking that he intended to transform Cambodia into a communist country closely aligned with the communist countries of Asia, should those countries win the war in IndoChina.
'Those are the facts which emerge from current events concerning Cambodia and its people, a people that aspires only to peace and justice. That is why we regret very much to note that our struggle for a just cause is still willfully disregarded or misunderstood by some countries, members of the great international organizations, which are constantly invoking the ideals of peace, liberty, independence and justice but for themselves only and not for others
13. Therefore, to those nations and their representatives who, out of selfish interest, prejudice or political opportunism, still insist on distorting the facts about my country when they speak in this Assembly, I should like on behalf of my Government to issue a solemn invitation to come to Cambodia to see for themselves the reality of the aggression of which the Khmer people is now the victim. Notwithstanding our present difficulties, we would make it our duty to give them a welcome worthy of their prestige and good faith and to furnish them with abundant and irrefutable proof of this aggression, which we intend to resist with all our strength, with all our resources, in order to preserve our independence, our neutrality and our territorial integrity.
14.	The representative of Albania spoke [1851st meeting] of resistance and the liberation war of the Cambodian people. I must point out to him that if there is resistance it is precisely that which we are putting up now against the foreign invasion by the VietCong, the North VietNamese and their allies.
15.	The representative of Albania also talked of a coup d'etat and described the legal Government of Cambodia as a clique. In so doing he echoed, on behalf of an absent party, the same distortions of the truth and specious arguments that had already been revealed as totally threadbare. As I said before, there was never a coup d'etat and Prince Norodom Sihanouk was deposed legally within the legal constitutional procedures. The only change that took place had to do with the person of the Chief of State.
16.	The government presided over by General Lon Nol was formed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk himself in October 1969, and it enjoys the unanimous support of the people.
17.	As for the so-called popularity of the Prince, it was a fiction even before his deposition, but it was totally annihilated on the day when, in a spirit of petty vengeance and in the hope of regaining power, Norodom Sihanouk appealed to foreign troops to invade his own country.
18.	Only a dictatorship can support another dictatorship. Authentic socialism could not support the retrograde feudalism of the few against the democratic aspirations of a whole people; despotism is a system of corruption and venality of those in authority a system worthy of the Middle Ages against a revolution waged, in order to gain liberty, equality and social justice.
19.	Cambodia, a Member of the United Nations, is now the victim of overt aggression perpetrated without justification by the VietCong, the North VietNamese and their allies. From the very beginning of that aggression the Government of Cambodia, in accordance with the terms of the United Nations Charter and the Geneva Agreements of 1954, appealed for a peaceful solution of this matter. Appeals were addressed to all the countries of the world without exception, as well as to the United Nations.
20.	Those appeals proved useless and our people are very puzzled about the sincerity of the desire for peace that everybody seems to be proclaiming so loudly. Fortunately, eleven countries of SouthEast Asia and the
Pacific Australia, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Laos, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the Republic of VietNam decided not to abandon us to our sorry fate. In accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter and at the brave and praiseworthy initiative of Indonesia, a conference of the Foreign Ministers of those eleven countries, on the subject of Cambodia, the victim of unjustified aggression, took place in Djakarta on 16 and 17 May 1970, with fairly encouraging results.
21. I shall simply quote a few points from the joint communique published in Djakarta on 17 May 1970:
'Point 5: Animated by a common desire to help restore peace and calm in Cambodia in particular and in SouthEast Asia in general, the Foreign Ministers reaffirmed the commitment of their countries to the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations Charter concerning the present problem, particularly the Article of the Charter which advocates a solution of all disputes among nations by peaceful means. They also recalled the Declaration of the Bandung Conference of AfroAsian countries in April 1955, having particularly in mind the principles concerning respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity and the nonintervention in the internal affairs of other States.
'Point 6: The Foreign Ministers recognized the desire of the Cambodian people to maintain a position of neutrality and nonalignment in international affairs and to be free to manage their own affairs. Reviewing the situation in Cambodia, the Foreign Ministers noted, however, with deep anxiety the serious worsening of the situation in that country which, in the long run, would endanger peace and stability in the whole of SouthEast Asia. They unanimously expressed the view that the future of Cambodia should be determined by the Cambodian people itself without foreign interference and in conformity with the declared Cambodian policy of strict neutrality and nonalignment, as set forth by the Government in its Declaration of 1957 and reaffirmed several times since then. In this respect they recalled the promises of the parties to the Geneva Agreement of 1954 and of other countries concerned to respect the sovereignty, neutrality, unity and territorial integrity of Cambodia and to refrain from any interference in the internal affairs of that country.
'Point 7: In the light of those considerations, the Foreign Ministers strongly urge:
'(«) That all acts of hostility should cease immediately and that all foreign forces should be withdrawn from the territory of Cambodia;
'(/?) That all parties should respect the sovereignty, independence, neutrality and territorial integrity of Cambodia and refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of that country, in order to enable the Cambodian people to solve their own problems by peaceful means of their choice, without any interference or pressure from outside;
'(c) That the coChairmen and participants in the 1954 Geneva Conference and the members of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia created by the Conference should consult together and cooperate with a view to reactivating that Commission;
4 \d) That the participants in the Geneva Conference of 1954 and all other interested parties should consult together in order to arrive at a consensus for the convening in the near future of an international conference for the purpose of finding a just, peaceful and effective solution to the present situation.
'Point 8: The Foreign Ministers decided to place on record their views and the above-mentioned recommendations with the United Nations. In doing so, they expressed the hope that all Members of the United Nations would thus be able to assess the gravity of these problems and offer their good offices to bring about a peaceful solution of the Cambodian problem by convening an international conference along lines suggested by the Secretary General of the United Nations and others.
'Point 9: The Foreign Ministers asked three of their members, the Foreign Ministers of Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia, urgently to begin consultations among themselves and with others, as well as with the coChairmen of the Geneva Conference, in order to begin discussions with the Secretary General of the United Nations and the President and members of the Security Council, with a view to action being taken by the United Nations. They asked the Ministers to report on the results of their efforts to the Governments represented at this conference. They authorized the President of the Conference to consult those Governments and other interested countries about the possibility of making further demarches in order to bring about a peaceful solution.'
22.	The people and the Government of Cambodia wish, through me, to pay a solemn tribute to all the friendly peoples and countries which have come to our aid, as well as those who agreed to come to Djakarta to try and find a solution to the grave difficulties with which Cambodia has been so unjustly confronted for some time now. By acting in this manner, those peoples and countries fully met their obligations under the United Nations Charter. The people of Cambodia ask nothing more than respect for its independence, neutrality and territorial integrity, and would like the United Nations, that is the General Assembly and the Security Council, to take initiatives and appropriate steps so as to restore peace promptly in Cambodia, a just peace to which a Member of the United Nations, a victim of a deliberate act of aggression, is fully entitled.
23.	Without doubt, there are those who are of the opinion that in cases where one of the parties is not a Member of the United Nations the Organization cannot intervene directly and effectively. In actual fact, however, what is happening in Cambodia is a genuine threat to international peace, a deliberate and clear act of aggression. And against States which remain outside the United Nations we find, in Chapter VII of the Charter, Articles 41 and 42, which can be applied effectively for the defense, maintenance and restoration of peace in Cambodia; these Articles allow pressure to be applied by Member States on the State non Member of the United Nations which has committed the aggression, including the severance of various kinds of relations with that State the breaking off of diplomatic relations, collective demonstrations or blockade by air, sea or land forces of Members of the United Nations.
24.	I would make it clear, however, that there are other ways and means for the peaceful settlement of disputes, the important point being to find as rapidly as possible a solution to put an end to the present situation in Cambodia, which is a breach of the peace and an act of aggression by foreign forces against a peaceful country in disregard of the sacred principles of international law.
25.	But even if one does not respect the principal objectives of the Charter and even if one scorns the principles of peaceful coexistence, at least one should not, as did the representative of Iraq this morning [1854th meeting], advocate interference in the internal affairs of a third country. We have never interfered in the internal affairs of other countries when they changed regime or government, even as the result of a coup d'etat.
26.	I must also emphasize that according to the evidence of diplomats and of foreign journalists living temporarily in Cambodia, there is no rebellion of the Khmer people or civil war. The proof that those who are now spreading war and destruction in Cambodia are in fact foreign invaders, that is to say, VietCong, North VietNamese and Pathet Lao, is clearly demonstrated by the fact that they did not openly begin their attacks until 29 March 1970, whereas the so-called National United Front of Kampuchea and the so-called Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea of Norodom Sihanouk were created only a month later, after the so-called 'summit conference of the Indo Chinese peoples', held on Chinese territory. Prince Norodom Sihanouk who is still in Peking, persists in having people believe that he is supported by partisans who are now supposed to have control of two thirds of Cambodia, according to him. If that is the case, why is it that the deposed Prince continues to take shelter in Peking instead of setting up his so-called Government in what he describes as 'the liberated parts of Cambodia'?
27.	Another proof that the present war is clearly an Act of aggression by VietCong, North VietNamese and their allies against Cambodia and not a civil war was provided recently, also by foreign journalists who were captured and subsequently released and some of whose colleagues were murdered in cold blood in Cambodia by the VietCong and the North VietNamese, since these latter considered them to be embarrassing witnesses.
28.	Journalists the world over were deeply shocked by this and some even called for United Nations intervention to ensure that such barbarous acts will not be renewed against members of the press.
29.	Let me recall here that VietCong and North VietNamese troops occupied the temples of Angkor Vat, gems of Khmer architecture representing an ancient civilization, which are the cultural properties not only of Cambodia but of mankind as a whole. In disregard of the provisions of the 1954 Hague Convention for the protection of cultural properties in cases of armed conflict of which Cambodia is one of the signatories the VietCong and North VietNamese troops, without any qualms, simply converted our monuments into sanctuaries so as to escape our defense forces. The whole world was incensed at the danger posed to these invaluable cultural properties by such an occupation. At this point, I wish to pay a special tribute to His Excellency SecretaryGeneral U Thant and to UNESCO for not sparing any effort to protect the Angkor Vat temples from destruction.
30.	Other countries and peoples are also the victims of similar acts of barbarity. It is not without good reason that some States Members of the United Nations have brought the matter before the Security Council. It is with great sadness that one follows the news of repeated kidnappings, assassinations of diplomats and journalists, hijacking and destruction of aircraft and menacing pressures on peaceful travelers. These acts are wholly unjustifiable and should be severely condemned by world public opinion, whatever the political and ideological reasons invoked. We must note that these ignoble methods are employed and encouraged by the same groups of individuals, the same organizations or the same countries which now more or less openly aid or encourage the VietCong and the North VietNamese to spread death and destruction throughout Cambodia.
31.	The Cambodian people, which cherish justice and peace, and respect the Charter of the United Nations, feel that the United Nations cannot remain indifferent and allow the perpetuation of such barbarous practices
iifitlim 11 millipitfnn ^k/) fi■	1.AMH
vViuiuui uuiiuyiug uic aiula ui 11S v^uaiiei. »yc iiGjjg
sincerely that this twenty-fifth session of the Assembly will seek with determination and all due speed all possible ways and means to put an end to the kidnapping of diplomats, the murdering of journalists, the hijacking and destruction of aircraft, unjustifiable acts of aggressions, including the current aggression by the Viet Cong and North VietNamese against Cambodia, so as to save the honor, the dignity and other human values which are seriously jeopardized by this outbreak of barbarity, which is without precedent in the history of the world. The Cambodian Government is ready to cooperate with any efforts undertaken in this respect by the United Nations.
32.	We remain opposed to the policy of racial discrimination and we continue to support the genuine liberation movements of the peoples still under colonial rule. But we firmly oppose the pseudo-liberation movements which engage in subversion and exploit the credulity of certain peoples in order to carry out annexion its aims to the detriment of neighboring countries.
33.	So far as the principle of the universality of the United Nations is concerned, we believe it is desirable that this should be achieved to the extent that the candidates which wish to become Members of the United Nations show by their behavior that they genuinely respect the principles of the Charter; otherwise, it would be harmful to international peace to admit States which have not respected and do not respect the requirements of the Charter, requirements that are essential for the maintenance of international peace and security and for the promotion of justice and prosperity in the world.
34.	More than ever we are devoted to the principle of the self-determination of peoples; yet it is essential that the implementation of this principle should be accompanied by appropriate guarantees. That is why we are sure that if the Members of the United Nations accord the General Assembly and the Security Council more authority and effectiveness the solution of all the major world problems can easily be found, and an age of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation could at last be opened.
35.	The delegation of Cambodia continues to place its hope in the United Nations and its trust in the wisdom of the leaders of this Organization. We trust that a just and equitable peace will be reestablished as rapidly as possible everywhere in the world, because on this solemn occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the signing of the Charter the peoples that are oppressed and victims of injustice are entitled to expect at least a minimum of effectiveness from an organization whose ultimate goal is after all, the promotion of peace, justice and prosperity for mankind.



"
25,1970,SLV,"Twenty-five years have elapsed since the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, and during that short span of time the scientific and technological revolution has acquired greater momentum, colonized peoples have achieved their independence, trade and communications have increased and international organizations have been successively embracing all the possible fields of cooperation among States. International policy has changed in character, and new diplomatic techniques have emerged in international organization. By looking back to the League of Nations, wherein the major part of United Nations activities finds some antecedent, we can gauge the distance covered by the international community in fifty years.
2.	There can be no accurate evaluation of the United Nations by comparing it with an ideal world in which its problems would invariably be solved rapidly and wisely; but it can be assessed in realistic terms by comparing it with its predecessor. Viewed from this perspective, the United Nations stands yp well against the most critical analysis, in both its political and its technical aspects.
3.	Now that the United Nations has reached its twenty-fifth year it is appropriate to take stock of the situation. Hence it is to be hoped that at the current session, apart from thoughtful speeches, measures will be adopted for the administrative review of the Organization. The United Nations has reached a stage where, instead of proliferating by addition, there is need for it to look into itself, to its structures, machinery and operative practices, so that it may grow in depth and density.
4.	In this year in which the United Nations celebrated its first twenty-fifth anniversary, it is particularly gratifying to my Government to have you, Mr. President, occupying the highest post in the General Assembly. It is with much feeling that I recall your association, Ambassador Hambro, with Dr. Jose Gustavo Guerrero, at the time when Dr. Guerrero was President of the International Court of Justice. You, Ambassador Hambro, are for ever linked by strong ties to El Salvador, and it was for this reason that my Government was among the first to sponsor your candidacy for the Presidency of the General Assembly. As a learned commentator of the Charter, as a veteran diplomat at innumerable conferences, you represent the ideals and the experience of the diplomatic community of the international organizations
5.	The matters that are before the United Nations, some old and others more recent, are so numerous that without minimizing the importance of any and subject to their discussion in the different committees, I shall confine my remarks to the following major issues: peace and security, maritime law, the Second Development Decade, the principle of universality and the review of the Charter.
6.	In the current year the major tension spots and even those of open warfare have been somewhat on the decrease. Hence, it is to be hoped that intelligent and realistic efforts may lead towards negotiation which will replace confrontations from positions of strength.
7.	In the Near East, where until a few days ago the horizon looked bleak and forbidding, there has been a promising opening which must be preserved and, as far as possible, extended. My Government conveys its best wishes to the friendly Governments of the United Arab Republic, Jordan and Israel for their determination to initiate and to keep the dialog open. Long and thorny is the path that these countries will have to tread. But it is precisely because of the difficulties that those Governments will have to overcome, that they deserve the commendation of the international community and should be given encouragement to persevere in the stand they have taken. The appeal addressed by the SecretaryGeneral to all the Members of the Security Council in July 1969  to exert all their influence in the United Nations in order to make the ceasefire effective was especially timely and has yielded, through a patient exercise of persuasion by friendly Governments, the initiation of a dialog within the framework of the United Nations. For our Organization it is decisive that those efforts be conceived and developed within the framework of its action machinery and under its aegis.
8.	In other regions as well, the violent antagonisms of the year 1969 have gone into a period of recession and dialog has yielded its first fruits. For instance, we hope that in Central America reason will prevail over passion and that the geography, the history and the principles of coexistence and the peaceful settlement of disputes will again become the guiding beacons of the subregional policy. In this connexion, my Government maintains a clearly defined and unalterable position to which it has remained faithful in the most tragic moments of its history and to which it is prepared to adjust its international conduct, that is to say, the line of reasonable and rational cooperation, of the defense of fundamental human rights, of the observance of the principles of international law construed as a system the components of which condition and interact among each other, and of compliance with formally contracted obligations.
9.	Among the numerous and complex disarmament problems, the prohibition of the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons has become a topical subject. To this end it is appropriate to recall the existence of a convention that enjoys great authority: the Geneva Protocol of 17 June 1925. The scope and meaning of that Protocol were discussed in the First Committee at the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly. On that occasion my Government, through its Permanent Representative, established its position concerning the scope and meaning of the aforementioned Protocol. The report of the fourteen experts  mentioned by the SecretaryGeneral, on the scientific evaluation of the effects of chemical and bacteriological weapons and their effects on the physical and biological environment is a valuable element for the orientation of United Nations action in his field.
10.	As for the manner in which the prohibition of the use of defoliants and other gases which are clearly banned in the Protocol can be made effective, my Government believes that General Assembly declarations which lack binding force are not the appropriate means to achieve that end. It is precisely because my Government wishes to have these ultramodern means of warfare banned that it considers that simple declarations of the Assembly are far too weak to achieve the aims pursued and believes that the United Nations should embark upon the slower but only sure and effective course of modifying the Geneva Protocol or of negotiating a new convention.
11.	Furthermore, my Government expressly stated in the First Committee and reiterates in this Assembly that it considers that the General Assembly of the United Nations lacks competence to interpret treaties and that for such purposes the United Nations has a competent body, the International Court of Justice; moreover, in accordance with Article 96, paragraph 1, of the United Nations Charter, the General Assembly may request an advisory opinion from the Court.
12.	As it has already stated, my Government seeks to ensure respect for the competence of the various bodies of the system as well as to ensure that the precedents have the necessary consistency to enable them to constitute a body of jurisprudence that interprets and develops the Charter.
13.	Of course, my Government is consistent with the doctrine it has upheld at other international conferences, that is, in drawing a very clear distinction between the two sources of international law, the law of treaties and customary law, and in denying that the contractual source, through the mere passage of time, may be regarded as the originator of custom. Acts of compliance with treaties cannot be regarded as generating custom. Therefore, my Government does not share in the thesis that treaties of European origin, conceived for European conditions, are a source of international custom, valid ergo ommes and hence binding on those who have not subscribed to such treaties. My Government has had occasion to expound in detail in the appropriate forums its position on this subject, and, if I now invoke the authority of the said Geneva Protocol and of other international conventions which my Government has not ratified, I do so by virtue of the value we attach to the contents of their provisions, independently of the binding force involved therein.
14.	Within the generally accepted principle that the seabed and ocean floor should be reserved exclusively for peaceful purposes, a first step is being taken with the draft treaty  which would prohibit the emplacement of nuclear weapons on the seabed. That draft, the coauthors of which are the United States and the Soviet Union, was the object of study by the General Assembly in 1969 and was referred back to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. The General Assembly will consider a new version of that draft treaty at the present session.
15.	My Government established its position concerning that draft treaty during the debate in the First Committee. That position is that, while we fully support the principle of the reservation of the seabed and ocean floor exclusively for peaceful purposes and while we are in favor of the prohibition of the emplacement on the seabed or ocean floor of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, my Government considers it undesirable and inadvisable to prejudge the solution of other problems of maritime law and to violate the interests and rights of coastal States as a result of an international agreement on the subject. El Salvador is not a party to the Convention on the territorial sea and the contiguous zone, signed in Geneva in April 1958. That Convention has received thirty-six ratifications in its twelve years of existence; hence it does not enjoy general acceptance. Therefore to embody its concepts in the draft treaty on the de-nuclearization of the seabed and ocean floor would be tantamount to presupposing that norms that reflect agreement of only a fraction of the international community have binding force.
16.	While my Government supports the substance and objectives of the Treaty it objects to the implication that it solves other natters which should be the object of direct negotiation through a conference on the sea. Prohibition of the emplacement of nuclear weapons on the seabed and ocean floor should be the object of formal international agreement, but it is not necessary rather it is prejudicial to the interests of many States for it to imply the acceptance of certain clauses in the Convention on the territorial sea and the contiguous zone. That prohibition can be agreed on through direct demarcation of the zone, independently of the fact that it encompasses a belt subject to national jurisdiction. It is irrelevant, for the purposes of the treaty, to distinguish between national and international zones. In this connexion, and omitting the implication of other conventions, the treaty could state purely and simply that the zone begins twelve miles from the coast.
17.	My Government follows with keen interest the work of the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression and notes with satisfaction that some progress has been achieved, despite the antagonistic schools of thought that obey conflicting political interests. Two theories are in conflict: on the one hand, that of a general definition based on essential elements and, on the other, that of a definition through an enumerative indication of conceivable cases at the present time. The first, a more technical thesis from the academic standpoint, offers wide margins of interpretation and application; hence the reluctance of some countries to accept it. The second thesis, which meets a criterion of certainty and security, implies the risk of not going far enough as regards the enumeration of foreseeable cases. If to define is to indicate the limits, and hence the scope and meaning, of a concept, both theses correspond to what might be regarded in international law as an essentially political definition, yet in the light of the rules of logic it is the former that would carry the vote.
18.	The definition of aggression is not an isolated subject; rather it is linked to legitimate self-defense, which changes the juridical qualification of an act of force. The same act of force considered in its material elements may in given circumstances constitute aggression and in other circumstances constitute an act of legitimate self-defense. On the other hand, aggression must be envisaged not only from the point of view of the use of violence across frontiers but also from the point of view of the use of violence in violation of fundamental rights of another State, contrary to international law and the fundamental norms of friendship and cooperation among States. Moreover, the principles and norms the violation of which constitute aggression should be regarded as part of a system, and in this sense such a definition cannot be taken to mean the indiea Jon of limits for isolated cases; rather the definition must recognize the multilateral conditioning of the major international principles. For instance, the very lofty principle of sovereignty could not be invoked to flout and trample under foot the fundamental rights of another State.
19.	It is most regrettable that economic aggression should be absent from the immediate program of the aforesaid Special Committee, for in the contemporary world economic aggression in some cases has replaced armed aggression. Economic aggression, for as long as it continues with the tolerant acquiescence of the international organizations, will constitute a breach in the organized system of world coexistence and will also continue to play its nefarious role of poisoning international relations. When economic aggression shows characteristics of persistence and intensity, it acquires a new nature, for then the economic weapon is brandished with intentions that are on destructive as war weapons, and, its purposes and results being similar, they deserve the same legal qualifications.
20.	This type of problem should be studied by the Special Committee in order to properly comply with its mandate. The longer we take to arrive at conclusions, the greater the risks that this great task of coexistence symbolized by the United Nations will founder in abysmal depths, confusion and abuses.
21.	Since El Salvador is not a member of the Special Committee, we shall have an opportunity to submit to the Sixth Committee our remarks on this important subject when the report of the Special Committee is considered.
22.	Few subjects arouse so much interest as the strengthening of international security because beneficial consequences of every kind are derived from security, including the still remote possibility that the amounts invested in armaments may be transferred to development.
23.	International security is closely linked with the abolition of atomic weapons and the effective and just operation of the international bodies dealing with political cooperation and economic and social development. The United Nations has achieved some successes such as the treaties on the denuclearization of the Antarctic,1 of outer space [resolution 2222 (XXI)] and of Latin America.  My Government is especially satisfied with the Treaty of Tlatelolco which eliminates atomic weapons from Latin American territories. The Treaty that is in the process of negotiation on the prohibition of the emplacement of atomic weapons on the seabed and ocean floor would considerably increase the important areas of the world in which such weapons are prohibited. But in other areas, and especially in the territories of the Great Powers and their military allies, atomic weapons are being accumulated in evergrowing quantities, and submarines loaded with hydrogen bombs sail the high sear, all over the world. Those weapons would suffice to annihilate the human species and to convert the earth into the most deserted of planets. Therefore the elimination of such weapons irom certain areas is a limited relief, and viewed in a more general context does little to help man out of the dilemma or snare in which he has fallen through his increased mastery over nature. The same can be said of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] which limits the number of States possessing the bomb and certainly the risk of a catastrophe, but which allows States members of the atomic club to retain their capacity to decide whether man will survive or whether he will join the fossilized species which paleontologists from other galaxies may discover thousands of years hence.
24.	The item on international security should be maintained on the agenda of the General Assembly, but caas for more detailed treatment than it was given in 1969, when the General Assembly was faced with several draft declarations that were finally merged in resolution 2606 (XXIV), which confined itself to declaring good intentions. Among those intentions, at least one contains a challenge to this Assembly inasmuch as it expresses the hope that at the current session, in which the United Nations celebrates its first twenty- five years, some appropriate recommendations may be made to strengthen international security. In keeping with this purpose of the General Assembly, my Government hopes to submit to the appropriate body and at the appropriate time concrete proposals which will carry this item on to a more practical plane than declarations of good intentions whose immediate fate is to clutter up the archives of the Organization.
25.	Concerning maritime law and the seabed and ocean floor, El Salvador has been participating in the fortytwo member Committee on the seabed.  Our contribution in that Committee was welcomed with goodwill by its members who entrusted the Permanent Representative of El Salvador with the post of Chairman of the Legal SubCommittee. My Government expresses its thanks for this show of confidence and friendship.
26.	The General Assembly requested of the Committee on the seabed through resolution 2574 B (XXIV) that it speed up its study of a comprehensive and balanced declaration of principles which may be accepted by the international community. The Committee has worked untiringly to meet that reque^ of the General Assembly, and although it has made considerable progress in the current year as a comparison between the synthesis included at the end of the second part of the report of the Legal SubCommittee in 1969  and the informal documents which were circulated in the latter part of the summer session held in Geneva will bear out there are still at least five major issues which while not insoluble, call for greater effort and more ingenuity to turn them into the common denominator that may be the object of a consensus. Tne Committee has accumulated a considerable wealth of experience in its two years of work and is better prepared than in the past to comply with its mandate. However, the subject it has to deal with is especially complex and is the object of varying and frequently of antagonistic interests requiring not a search for perfect solutions based on reason, but political solutions based on compromise.
27.	The task of the seabed Committee is among the most complex and important work now under way in the United Nations. If this were an academic exercise, the Committee would have long since produced a declaration of principles, but what is at stake are great political decisions and the interests of the maritime Powers and of countries having extensive coastlines and scant means to exploit the resources of the sea, of countries with advanced technology and developing countries, of regions having inland seas and regions facing wide expanses of the sea all extreme points in a broad spectrum of intermediate conditions and interests.
28.	There should be a single declaration of principles. It should be a guideline for the regime to be established and should be conceived in simple and abstract terms, but the regime should bear in mind the normative plurality in order that its norms may also take into account special facts and achieve international justice.
29.	My Government considers that details and qualifications create obstacles that stand in the way of agreement on principles bacause they introduce contents that some States are not in a position to accept. The road to agreement lies in simple, direct and abstract formulas. As soon as attempts are made to introduce specific elements we fall into discussions and disagreements. For the formulation of principles, abstraction and simplicity are the appropriate techniques. Of course if it were a question of agreeing on the regime of the seabed and the ocean floor, qualifications and specific formulas could not be avoided.
30.	The formulas to be embodied in the declaration should not prejudge, imply or presuppose controversial theses on the law of the sea. If tb~'ieh the declaration of principles attempts were made 'aw advantages for the solution of other question we would come to r deadend street and implicitly we would be rent/uncing our wish to comply with the mandate given to the Committee. For instance, such formulas should not prejudge either in favor of or against the General Assembly moratorium or in favor or against either limitation of the zone or of the rights of the coastal States or of a provisional regime.
31.	But the declaration of principles must spell out certain fundamental questions relating exclusively to the use of the seabed and the ocean floor as for example, the principles which recognize that the seabed and ocean floor are the common heritage of mankind, that resources shall be exploited for the benefit of all peoples, and that an international organization shall administer the joint and common 1 iterests of peoples and, especially, will seek to ensure compliance with the regime to be established under the treaty.
32.	The determination of the nature of the principles of the declaration is of the highest importance. For the present it would appear that a common denominator could be found if the declaration were to be regarded as a guideline for the regime which would exclude the interpretation, unacceptable to many States, that it could be construed as being a provisional regime.
33.	The SecretaryGeneral undertook the consultations requested of him by the General Assembly [resolution 2574 A (XXIV)] on a possible conference on the sea, My Government responded to that consultation and stressed that a new conference on the sea should not be restrictive in character but rather that its objectives should be broad so as to allow for the study of the various pending matters relating to the law of the sea while updating others which, although there has been general agreement thereon, call for normative reforms.
34.	My Government is opposed to the convening of a conference with a restricted agenda, limited in advance, which would probably contain items that are of interest to the maritime Powers and the developed countries, while leaving aside those problems and subjects that are of interest to the developing countries. Thus the possibility of world understanding, of a systematic and joint treatment of the different subjects and of the sense of harmony and balance which should preside over those chapters of the international law of the sea, would be lost.
35.	Of course, a conference conceived in the terms advocated by my Government does not run the risk of foundering by reason of the imprecision and overabundance of items. Were it to be convened as a broad, comprehensive conference covering all matters relating to pending questions on the law of the sea and were it to be entrusted to a preparatory commission which would be in constant consultation with the States concerned, it would illicit proposals for items over a given period of time, but in the last analysis it would be a conference with a defined and limited agenda. In other words, the divergency with those who want a limited conference lies in the fact that they want the items to be defined in the letter convening the conference while my Government considers that the convening should be broad and that the items on the agenda should be determined in the course of the preparatory work. The conference would have to be carefully prepared and well thought out, there should be no improvisations and an opportunity should be given for a unified, balanced and harmonious treatment of all pending matters, whether they be new or old, with a view to completing or amending the most sensitive parts of contemporary maritime law.
36.	International law was conceived by Europeans for European conditions. As new circumstances arose, it was enriched by several Latin American doctrines; but the resistance opposed by European authors to the adoption of such doctrines, and the difficulties they encounter in some international courts are well known. Language is a barrier to the study of these old Latin American juridical doctrines by the recently emerged nations of Asia and Africa. My Government believes that countries in the process of development have a real interest in contributing to the progress of international law and that, just as they have opposed political colonialism, they would be prepared to close the way to intellectual colonialism. Of course, if this purpose is to become a reality it must find concrete expression in a clearly defined and consistent policy in all international forums.
37.	With reference to the Second United Nations Development Decade, the highly important role played by the United Nations since its establishment in regard to a world policy for development, so far as its strategy is concerned, is focused to a large degree on the Second Development Decade.
38.	The General Assembly will consider a draft declaration [A 17982, para. 16] on what could become a global strategy for development. The treatment of the problem in world dimensions implies, in itself, considerable progress, and, as such, is deserving of our commendation.
39.	The draft represents a compromise between the divergent interests of the developed and the developing countries and takes account of the policy that has been applied since the establishment of the United Nations and which experience has shown to be inadequate. There looms over the Second Decade, as there will loom over decades to come, a basic failing: we have been unable to persuade the developed countries that the economic progress of the developing world means their own progress and that, rather than in terms of political influence, development should be viewed in terms of mutual economic advantages, since developed countries make better customers than poor countries.
40.	It might be appropriate to point to a striking phenomenon in the world policy of recent years: the political unity and growing solidarity of interests of the developing countries in broad spheres and outside any ideological context.
41.	Development as a world plan should promote in the relatively less developed countries the formation of their own stocks of capital; it follows therefore that their best recourse lies in broad trade arrangements. The transfer of capital through loans and investments should be a supplementary element. So long as no satisfactory solutions to world trade are found there will be lacking an important generating nucleus for development, and some countries will get increasingly in debt and will end up reexporting in terms of amortization, interest and profits more capital than they receive.
42.	None of the United Nations services deals in a comprehensive manner with the transfer of science and technology and, therefore, this very important aspect of development is being serviced in a fragmentary and dispersed manner. In this connexion, Economic and Social Council resolution 1454 (XLVII), which contemplates the strengthening and coordination of current activities, has embarked upon the right course. Services connected with this subject could be coordinated, and work in this field could be carried out under a clearly defined and unified coordination policy; such coordination could lead to a merging of administrative activities. This is one of the decisive chapters for the Second Decade and calls for an emphatic, direct, overall approach.
43.	The Second Decade, as conceived, will not reverse the implacable trend resulting in the formation of two galaxies of developed and developing peoples respectively, which continue slowly to drift apart. In fifteen years, even if the greater part of the policy recommended in the proposed strategy is adopted, the gap between the two galaxies will have doubled.
44.	The 6 per cent yearly rate of growth, which it is to be hoped the developing countries will achieve in the first part of the Decade and of which it is said vaguely as though expressing a faint hope that there is a 'possibility that a higher rate of growth may be achieved in the second half of the Decade', is perhaps realistic. But there is no reference in the draft to the ratio between the growth rate of that galaxy as compared to that of the galaxy of developed peoples.
45.	In the report of the Preparatory Committee, it is stated timorously that if an average rate of growth of 3.5 per cent in per capita income were maintained during the Decade it would be possible to achieve ''at least a modest beginning towards narrowing the gap in living standards between developed and developing countries' [A 17982, para. 16(13)]. It might be questioned whether this modest growth in per capita income would truly begin to close that gap. Let us quote some figures. Let us suppose that certain countries have an annual per capita income of 300 and others 1,200. The 3,5 per cent for the 30<; would result in a per capita income of 310.5 the first year. But if those who have 1,200 realize a 2 per cent growth in income let us not say 3.5 per cent as in the case of the former this would yield an increase 24 for the first year. From the first year the relative growth would not represent a modest reduction in the relative gap, but rather in increase. Let us assume an increase of 5 per cent in the per capita income of countries starting with 1,200, because even this insignificant sum which is negligible for the developed countries and, therefore, inadequate as a hypothesis, unless we choose to be absurd would give them an increase of 12, and it is obvious that 12 is higher than 10.5.
46.	In the second year, the country having 310.5 end a 3.5 per cent increase would increase by 10.86; but the one having 1,224 with a 2 per cent increase would increase its income by 24.48. If in the case of the latter we assume an increase of 1 per cent, which would be a ridiculous figure given the growth rate of the developed countries, and on the assumption that in the first year there was also a 1 per cent growth, the per capita income would rise by 12.12 and this figure is higher than 10.86.
47.	The purpose of the examples figures I have quoted is to show that we fail to understand how with the current strategy the Second Decade can constitute 'a modest beginning towards narrowing the gap in living standards between developed and developing countries'', as asserted in the aforementioned document on development strategy.
48.	Among the complex arrangements for world trade under discussion, we find that of preferences scheme. As regards this question European preferences in favor of the African countries have brought to mind intra-continental preferences. But we should not add one distortion to another; and, before finally deciding on a scheme for world trade, we should work for the elimination of existing regional preferences and their replacement by general preferences accessible to countries from all areas of the world. Fortunately, the draft strategy favors generalized nonreciprocal non discriminatory preferences.
49.	I now come to the question of the universality of the United Nations. We find in the Charter the principle of universality, because the United Nations, by vocation and if it is to be effective, must be universal. The many stumbling blocks it had come across in its twenty-five years are due to the fact that this principle could not be made a reality. But this shortcoming cannot be imputed to the General Assembly, the Security Council or to certain Governments, since it stems from the very origins of the Organization itself. In fact, the United Nations was born when passions still raged at the end of the Second World War, which explains the content of Article 107, which speaks of enemy States.
50.	Universality is a principle, not a norm, and it follows that it inspires a policy but not an immediate and executive mandate implying the solution of specific political problems. There are serious political problems, especially as regards the division of national States as a result of civil strife or international wars, which cannot be solved by merely invoking the principle of universality. In such cases it is necessary to confront those problems and attempt to solve them in order to make universality a reality. The United Nations is not lagging behind in regard to the principle of universality because in twenty-five years it has not made that principle effective, but, rather, because of the lack of interest, imagination or realism with which it has dealt with certain problems and, what is ever more delicate, because of the practice that has been established of living in & status quo which, while being the case was out for the present, incubates greater problems for the near future. Universality must be lived, but without doing violence to the feelings and sentiments of peoples and without violating other principles, such as self-determination and the right to national independence understood not in isolation but as a system whose parts are interdependent and condition each other.
51.	Universality, apart from the chronically well known problems, has for some time been touching on the case of the so-called microStates. It is not easy ? to define a microState, although it might be a result
of a concurrence of factors, such as territory population, national product, capacity to contribute to the regular budget of the United Nations. If such restrictive criteria for admission to the United Nations were to be introduced, a precedent which could be easily invoked in the future would be created, and once such restrictions are introduced they would follow the
trend of the taxation of national and international organizations' budgets in other words, they would only move upwards. Once the income is regulated, there is nothing to prevent its permanency being questioned. This is a delicate matter because the United Nations could well end up by becoming an exclusive club with access to membership conditioned by material and financial considerations having some precedent in the contemporary international community, namely the atomic club.
52.	Any definition of microState, however restrictive, could be applied to some of the present Members of the United Nations. Since no one is proposing, indeed, no one conceives, that a State Member of the United Nations may be deprived of its acquired rights, it could happen that one microState might be a full Member of the United Nations while other States whose conditions are similar would not be full Members, for reasons that could not be imputed to them, but merely because independence has come late to them in the process of decolonization.
53.	Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations makes no distinction between large, medium, small or minute States, but, rather, inspired by the principle of universality, it speaks of 'peace-loving States' which, in the opinion of the Organization, are able to comply with the obligations they undertake. We mean all obligations, including financial obligations, provided they are willing to do so.
54.	When so much is being said of universality on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary, it would be inconsistent to reform the Charter in order to reduce the population scope of the Organization. I come now to the question of the review of the Charter of the United Nations. On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary, the desirability of reviewing the Charter has been considered. The opinion is bruited about that the United Nations has only partially met the objectives which inspired its foundation twenty-five years ago. In the face of this judgment, the question arises whether the reason is some constitutional flaw that could be remedied by negotiating amendments to the Charter, or whether it is something deeper that touches the very core of international policy and expresses the will of states, who are less inclined than they were twenty-five years ago to rely on multilateral diplomacy.
55.	My Government considers that we cannot postpone consideration of the review of the Charter. This means that an opportunity should be given to assess the ideas and proposals of Member States through a kind of evaluation of the Charter, which regardless of the results may prove to be a healthy exercise.
56.	The ineffectiveness we have seen in the United Nations in its first twenty-five years probably cannot be overcome with a few mere amendments to the Charter, since the causes underlying its shortcomings run much deeper. As in the case of States, we find in international life that problems are solved not only through improved legislation but through a process of determination of the causes and the conditioning of
social, political and economic factors. This, however, does not prevent its being desirable to have better laws, provided they are the best suited to the circumstances and not those suited to a Utopian world.
57.	Moreover, if the review of the Charter were to be considered, we would have a reference point and a nucleus around which we could study the major problems of the international community. Governments would bring their views and would benefit from the views of others. However, my Government is not unaware of the obstacles that stand in the way not only of a possible amendment to the Charter, but also of the possibility of beginning the consideration of such a topic. This shows the frail balance in which the international community has been placed by the Charter, a balance that has become crystallized and immobile in these twenty-five years, and which, if compared with those pioneer years of faith and confidence of the first Decade, has become even more precarious.
58.	My Government does not share the view that the General Assembly must annually produce an impressive number of resolutions on the most varied subjects, but, rather advocates the focusing of debate and resolutions on those subjects, measures and provisions that imply a constructive and profitable discussion of matters within its competence. Even in regard to those questions that are within its competence, my Government believes the time has come to adopt a criterion of restraint based on timeliness and priorities. The Organization's prestige and effectiveness so demand it, especially at this time when the Canadian delegation has most appropriately raised the question of the rationalization of procedures and organization of the General Assembly. But the need for rationalization goes beyond procedures and allocation of items and readjustment of the competence of committees, and must be extended to the very substance of items and subjects and the spirit presiding over our deliberations and recommendations.
59.	And yet, if there were no United Nations, we would immediately have to create some other international organization. While much criticism, I would go so far as to say, deserved criticism may be leveled against the United Nations, no one would think seriously of destroying it. Such criticism, after all, is no more than criticism of the States themselves, of the Members of the Organization, and reflects the ups and downs of the international community. Successes and failures in the United Nations increase the assets and liabilities of the Members, and criticism of the United Nations is to some extent criticism of the Member States, and hence to some extent self-criticism. When we ask something of the United Nations, we must stop to ponder on what we ourselves are prepared to give in order that our requests may be met.
60.	The Charter of the United Nations does not reflect the true balance between the achievement of peace and the realization of justice. Peace, both national and j international, examined in terms of its conditions and content and viewed on the basis of a whole set of
factors, is invariably linked to justice. However, only  when it reflects a superficial status quo, can it be regarded as a separate phenomenon divorced from the conditions and causes that engender it. It is dealt with as such in the Charter, since in the Charter justice holds a collateral, not to say marginal, position. 'Justice' was included after a veritable fray lasting many hours at the twenty-fourth session about the slogan of the twenty-fifth anniversary but it invariably occupies a choice place in statements. When attempts are made in political forums to resolve certain conflicts, as soon as justice is invoked a sibylline climate cloaks the whole question that no one dares to openly avow, and a skeptical, comfortable, relaxed attitude is struck, much like that of a character depicting several situations, only instead of the question 'what is truth?' being asked, 'what is justice?' is what we hear.
61.	Were the Charter to be amended, then that would be the time to reorient the United Nations towards two equally valid and correlative goals: international peace and security.


"
25,1970,LKA,"
176.	 Mr. President, the delegation of Ceylon and I, personally, are very happy to see you preside over this, the Twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. It often happens that an individual can adorn a high office just as much as a high office can add luster to its incumbent. In your case, your estimable qualities add to the prestige and standing of an office already held in the highest regard both within and outside the United Nations. To the two priceless attributes of scholarship and skill which you possess in full measure, you bring to your office the advantage of vast and varied experience and, not least of all, the distinction of noble diplomatic lineage. On behalf of the delegation of Ceylon, I extend to you our warmest congratulations and best wishes for your success in guiding our deliberations. For my part I would say that one of the most gratifying features of your presidency so far is that you have not used it to preach sermons to us down below on our responsibilities, whether as individual members or as groups. None of us becomes superior to the rest, except in altitude, through elevation to the chair. It is a mark of your greatness that you recognize this fact.
177.	It is no reflection on you, Mr. President, that we miss the feminine charm and honored presence of our former President, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph.
178.	My delegation would also like to take this opportunity of saluting our chief executive, the distinguished SecretaryGeneral, U Thant, who continues to maintain unblemished his record of devoted and conscientious service to the international community. As always, he has demonstrated in his treatment of international problems the compassion of the humane and the humanity of the compassionate.
179.	It was my expectation that my Prime Minister, the honorable Sirimavo Bandaranaike, would attend the commemorative session and address the General Assembly. Regrettably, she has been obliged to cancel the arrangements she had made to visit New York for this purpose and it has fallen to me, therefore, to represent Ceylon in the general debate.
180.	Institutions, like individuals, are inclined to attach an exaggerated importance to the periodical recurrence of certain significant events in their history or their life. This tendency could not have been better described than it was by the Foreign Minister of Brazil when he referred to our preoccupation with clepsidras, calendars and clocks [1841st meeting]. The United Nations has shown a marked propensity towards this preoccupation. It has become a habit with us to proclaim a year for this and a decade for that. There is no denying the fact that man derives moral sustenance from recollections of the past. Experience has, however, shown that in the United Nations we achieve little more by this process than to create a new committee, generate a fresh and repetitive cycle of rhetoric in more than one forum and produce or fail to produce a resonant declaration or resolution. All this activity insulates us from the world of stark reality and may give us a respite from responsibility. My delegation would sincerely hope that one of our good resolutions on this Twenty-fifth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter would be to change our habits in this regard and to pay more attention in the future to substance than to form, to the causes of conflict rather than to its ephemeral manifestations. This session is already being described as an historic one. Whether it proves to be so or not will depend entirely on what we achieve during it. Let us not be too hasty in according it a place in history, which ultimately it may not be found to have deserved. It would be better for us to show the determination, through concrete and positive achievement, to assure it such a place.
181.	Before I turn to the problems that face the United Nations today and to the measures that might be taken to give it greater vitality and to resurrect it from its present state of almost complete ineffectiveness in the political sphere, I should like to refer to recent developments in Ceylon's foreign policy. In May of this year a new Government took office in Ceylon, elected by the freely exercised vote of all men and women above the age of eighteen. It was a dramatic demonstration of the power and the glory of democracy and above all of the value of the electoral process, free from any extraneous influences, as a means of selecting the government of a country. It was the authentic voice of the people choosing between parties whose alternative programs, promises and pledges were openly available for free choice. Critics of our foreign policy would do well to remember that it represents the expression of the will of the people, the sovereign element in a genuine and robust democracy. The decisions taken in the sphere of foreign relations by the new Government in Ceylon are not directed against any particular Power or group of Powers or against any particular interest or group of interests. They are not calculated, nor do we believe that they will tend, to impede progress towards the settlement of any of the problems that have been plaguing the world for years, the unhappy legacy of the Second World War, such as the problem of the division of countries according to the ideological affiliations or predilections of their divided parts. We believe that nations or States are no more than the legal and constitutional aggregate of their peoples and that the purpose of international
relations is to promote contact and, thereby, understanding and goodwill between peoples in different parts of the world. Long years of separation without any perceptible progress towards reunification prove the futility of external attempts at such reunification. A divided people must be left to heal their divisions by negotiation among themselves without external pressure or interference.
182.	On all sides we have heard delegations of widely divergent political persuasions stressing the importance of making the United Nations more effective and emphasizing the need for strict compliance with Security Council resolutions as the best means of ensuring United Nations effectiveness. In organized society, defiance of authority or any transgression of the law is punished with sanctions. Respect for authority can be fostered if individual Members express in some overt manner their disapproval of any State which disregards United Nations resolutions and, more particularly, the resolutions of the Security Council adopted in the discharge of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. This type of moral sanction, if exerted in appropriate cases and in an appropriate manner by an increasing number of Members of the Organization, could be a powerful instrument in the preservation of international law and order.
183.	Ceylon professes a policy of nonalignment and has made it the cornerstone of its foreign policy; we shall not waver in pursuing such a policy. There are no weapons, material or physical, by which such a
policy can be enforced. As my Prime Minister stated in her address at the Third Conference of Heads or State or Government of NonAligned Countries, held in Lusaka last month,
'. . .the main instrument of nonalignment continues to be that of moral persuasion. Our priorities today are full recognition and acceptance by all nations of the fundamental dignity and equality of all peoples. . . .We seek to preserve our true independence without interference with the rights of others.''
184.	During the general debate, now drawing to a close, Member after Member has appeared in the role of diagnostician, subjecting the ailing United Nations body to an embarrassing clinical examination. Some have been bold enough to prescribe forms of treatment which would be no more efficacious than aspirin as a remedy for cancer. The methods of treatment that have been suggested can serve as little more than temporary palliatives; they take no account of the causes of international disputes,, conflicts and tensions that threaten the peace. The only form of treatment that holds out any hope of success is one which treats the cause of the condition that it seeks to heal.
185.	Procedural devices must not be neglected. They deserve a trial but they can fulfill only a limited purpose and have a limited range of efficacy, whether they be regular meetings of the Security Council at the level of Foreign Ministers, fact-finding missions or conciliation panels. We must not allow the newly exhibited
zeal for hitherto unused forms of procedure to divert our attention from the origins and the real causes of the very serious situations that are an ever-present danger to the peace of the world. The principal cause is injustice.
186.	The United Nations has adopted' 'Peace, justice and progress' as its slogan for the Twenty-fifth anniversary, thus proclaiming its objectives as it embarks on the next phase of its existence. We would place justice as the first of our aims, since there can be no peace without justice, nor can there be progress without peace.
187.	The chief forms of injustice still prevalent in our world are the denial of the right of self determination to peoples still under colonial rule and the monstrous policy of apartheid practiced by the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. Member States which honestly subscribe to the principles of the Charter could have fervently hoped that we would celebrate the Twenty-fifth anniversary of the signing of the Charter and inaugurate, simultaneously, the second phase of United Nations existence with the consummation of the process of decolonization formally endorsed 10 years ago by the General Assembly in its resolution 1514 (XV). The Government of Portugal has frustrated that hope and continues, with the moral and material support and encouragement of its military allies in NATO, to hold the African peoples in its colonial Territories under bondage and servitude.
188.	The Lusaka Conference of NonAligned Nations, held last month, noted with deep concern that Portugal is waging a colonial war of suppression in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) with NATO arms, and called upon the members of NATO to prevent the sale or supply of weapons and military equipment to the Portuguese Government and to stop the sale or shipment to the Portuguese Government of equipment and materials for the manufacture or the maintenance of weapons and ammunition. The member countries of NATO should take note of this appeal and be mindful that they will be judged by the opponents of colonialism and the advocates of the right of self-determination for subject peoples, not by their pious professions of loyalty to the concept and policy of decolonization but by their positive response to the Lusaka appeal and their willingness to abandon their present cynical policy.
189.	Apartheid remains the ugliest and crudest of policies and practices in our time. The United Nations has failed to arrest its spread from South Africa and Namibia to Zimbabwe, where an illegal racist minority and rebel regime survives and thrives under the direct patronage and support of its avowed allies, the Governments of South Africa and Portugal. There can be no hope of peace in Africa until those forms of injustice are erased completely.
190.	The Lusaka Conference strongly deplored the declared intention of the United Kingdom Government to resume the sale of arms to South Africa. A propos of this proposed change of policy, may I be permitted to introduce a lighter note into this long and serious debate. It seems to me that the United Kingdom delegation to this session might, with apologies to Alfred, Lord Tennyson, say:
'We come from haunts of Heath and Home
'Who've made a sudden sally
'To ponder now the sale of arms
'And bolster Vorster's folly.'
191.	We trust that the recent report to the effect that the United Kingdom Government is reconsidering this policy is true and that that Government will abandon the dark and armored route to Simonstown.
192.	Next to the eradication of injustice, the prospects of peace and security rest largely in the steady advance towards general and complete disarmament. Although this objective has been adopted by the United Nations it has not yet been clearly defined. There is a tendency today to treat disarmament as a reduction in the lethal capacity of weapons; on the other hand, there is no indication of any willingness on the part of those Powers which are capable of producing the deadliest weapons to forgo one of the means by which they can continue to be refined, that is, the testing of nuclear weapons underground. Strategic arms limitation will reduce the expenditure of the two superPowers on the most expensive types of weapons and will, in one respect, arrest the arms race, but it will not appreciably diminish the aggressive and destructive potential of the superPowers.
193.	What is needed immediately is a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests, the cessation of the production of further nuclear weapons, the gradual reduction in the volume of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction that have already been accumulated, and the prohibition of chemical and biological warfare together with the production and stockpiling of chemical and biological weapons. A disarmament policy, even in the modified form which it has hitherto taken of a partial test-ban treaty, a nonproliferation Treaty and treaties for the peaceful uses of outer space and Antarctica, can be of full effect only if it is accepted by all Powers capable of producing nuclear weapons or of introducing such weapons into prohibited areas. As long as one of the nuclear Powers, the People's Republic of China, is left outside the international pale through the denial of its lawful rights in the United Nations, these measures of disarmament are doomed to failure. A vital contribution to peace is therefore the attainment of universality in the membership of the United Nations. This requires the immediate restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in this Organization.
194.	The third element in the slogan for this Twenty- fifth anniversary session is progress. One of the principal aims of the Charter is the promotion of social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom and to this end Members pledge themselves to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples. In any community economic inequality and social injustice are the chief causes of unrest and instability. This is equally true of the relations between States. It is universally recognized that steady economic growth in the developing countries, with the improvement in living standards that it brings, is in the general interest of all, and therefore any contribution made by the developed half of the world towards greater economic growth in the developing half is a contribution to the prosperity of all. Such a policy provides a proper mixture of altruism and self-interest.
195.	The General Assembly will soon be called upon to adopt an international development strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [A 17982, para. 16] which analyses the problem of development and proposes definite measures of policy. The draft international development strategy acknowledges that the primary responsibility for development rests with the developing countries, but also recognizes the need for assistance from the developed countries in the form of an increased flow of financial resources to the developing countries and the adoption by the developed countries of more favorable economic and commercial policies towards the developing countries. The best informed opinion has found that although the total volume of the net flow of financial resources from the developed to the developing countries increased in 1968 over the previous year, it represented a smaller percentage of the gross national product of the developed market economies than in 1967 and that the share of the developing countries in the world export market was declining, a sign of the widening gap between the developed and the developing sections of the world. The international development strategy, if it is to be successful, requires a firm commitment on the part of each economically advanced country to adhere to the quantitative and temporal targets that are proposed for the net transfer of financial resources to the developing countries. It is not necessary here to go into the details of these targets,
196.	The agreement recently reached within the International Monetary Fund to create an addition to international liquidity in the form of special drawing rights, amounting to $9.5 thousand million over a period of three years, could be turned to the fullest advantage in the service of the international development strategy if the developed nations agreed to augment their contribution to programs of economic development in developing countries by releasing a portion of their share of the special drawing rights or its equivalent in national currencies, depending on the mechanics of the operation, for the purpose of financing development in developing countries.
197.	Ceylon's experience has proven that foreign aid as a means of financing development has severe limitations and many disadvantages. It creates serious problems of debt servicing which impose a heavy and recurring burden on the country's foreign exchange budgets for successive years. We believe therefore more in trade and better trade than in aid. Foreign aid should be no more than a temporary means of financing development. Increased trade on better terms, on the other hand, would help developing countries to build up their own external reserves for the financing of development and would give them a greater degree of self-reliance which is one of the best guarantees of steady and self-sustained economic growth in the true sense of the term. Developing countries have of late been warned of the price that has to be paid in the form of environmental pollution for industrial development. All developing countries are aware of the risks, but I am sure that they would be quite prepared to accept from the developed countries even 1 per cent of their gross national pollution if thereby they could diversify their economies through industrialization.
198.	The question of the peaceful uses of the seabed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and the use of their resources for the benefit of mankind has been before the General Assembly for almost three years. It is recognized that arrangements must be made for the orderly exploration and exploitation of this new source of seemingly limitless wealth. At the Twenty-fourth session the General Assembly called upon the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the SeaBed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction to expedite its work of preparing a comprehensive and balanced statement of principles designed to promote international cooperation in the exploration and use of the seabed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and ensure the exploitation of their resources for the benefit of mankind, irrespective of the geographical location of States, taking into account the special interests and needs of the developing countries, whether landlocked
or coastal.
199.	During the two sessions it held this year, the Committee was unable to reach agreement on a comprehensive and balanced statement of principles that would provide the framework of the new regime for the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the area. My delegation would like to see a regime supported by appropriate international machinery, established through an international agreement open to adherence by all States which would provide for the orderly development and rational management of the area and its resources as the common heritage of mankind and for the equitable sharing by States of the benefits so derived, special consideration being given to the interests and needs of developing countries, whether landlocked or coastal. The draft declaration of principles will be the first stage in this process. We have not abandoned our efforts to reach agreement on a draft declaration, and even now consultations are in progress to resolve our remaining differences.
200.	It is my hope that the Committee on the seabed and ocean floor will be able to place before the First Committee and General Assembly at this session a draft declaration which will command the support of all groups. Those of us who belong to the nonaligned group of nations have been enjoined by the Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries that met in Lusaka last month, specifically to exert efforts towards the adoption of a declaration of principles at this session. A special statement adopted by that Conference sets out five essential elements which should, among others, be incorporated in such a declaration. I should like to stress that the Lusaka statement is not exhaustive of the elements that should find a place in the declaration of principles.
201.	We believe it to be essential for the development of the resources of the seabed and the ocean floor that the area be reserved exclusively for peaceful purposes and that its use for military purposes b^ prohibited. We are glad to note that the first step towards that end has been taken by the coChairmen of the Committee on Disarmament, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States, with the preparation of a draft treaty on the prohibition of the emplacement of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and the ocean floor and in the subsoil thereof, which is expected to come before the General Assembly at this session.
202.	There are several outstanding issues relating to the law of the sea which require the urgent attention of the international community. To mention some of them: the establishment of the maximum breadth of the territorial sea; the navigation of international straits; preferential fishery rights for coastal States; measures to combat the growing menace of pollution in the marine environment and the limits of national jurisdiction over the continental shelf.
203.	My Government would like to see an early start made on preparations for a conference on the law of the sea at which those interrelated issues could be discussed and resolved.
204.	Let me refer, in conclusion, to one of the most tragic problems of our day, a problem for which the United Nations bears a responsibility and which is a blot on the United Nations record. A few months ago I had occasion to visit some of the refugee camps in the Middle East. Here the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and other humanitarian organizations are performing a heroic mission with severely limited resources. Those who contribute towards the maintenance of these   according to reliable estimates   more than a million refugees deserve our warmest thanks and appreciation. But that is no answer and gives the United Nations no absolution. Here are the human remnants of a people who once had a country of their own   the British mandated Territory of Palestine. It was created at the end of one war only to be destroyed after the next. Their experience is without parallel even in the shabbiest records of the human race. They have been condemned to live in squalid shacks and tattered tents in a wasteland of ruined hopes and empty dreams, most of them for almost 22 years. They are without a State, without a community and without an organization in which they can lead a decent human existence, rear their children as other humans rear theirs and

rise above the degrading necessity of living on an international dole.
205.	There are people all over the world living in huts below subsistence level, but they belong somewhere. Not so the Palestinians. They are being held up to ransom in a much cruder and more brutal form than the airline passengers of hijacked planes. Their tribulations are a life sentence from which only the United Nations can grant them a reprieve. We would hope that something of the strenuous diplomatic energy that is being displayed in regard to the problem of hijacking would be diverted towards a search for a satisfactory solution of the Palestine problem. The United Nations believes injustice. Here is its opportunity to prove itself. This is only a part, though a very important part, of the whole Middle East problem for which we hope a just settlement will soon be found   a settlement just to all.
206.	My Government continues to support without qualification the form of settlement contemplated in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, which is founded on the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from all Arab territories occupied after 5 June 1967.
207.	In concision, the Foreign Minister of India reminded us that today is the 101st anniversary of the birth of the noblest apostle of peace and justice this modern age has known, Mahatma Gandhi. The world has long forgotten the weapon he forged and used with such telling effect, the weapon of satyagraha or nonviolence. If we can revive the Mahatma's message of peace and justice we can still bring out the best in ourselves and make the principles of the Charter a living reality."
25,1970,ZMB,"60.	 Mr. President, I wish, first of all, to associate my delegation with the sentiments expressed by those who have already congratulated you on your election to the high office of President of this crucial and historic session of the General Assembly. Your credentials and personal attributes leave my delegation in no doubt that you are eminently qualified to guide the proceedings of this important session of the General Assembly. Mr. President, you can count on the unstinting support and cooperation of my delegation to make your' tenure of office a success.
61.	Allow me also to pay tribute to your predecessor, Her Excellency Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph of Liberia, who presided over the proceedings of the last session. The success which attended our last session is attributable, in no small measure, to her able and wise leadership. This illustrious daughter of Africa has set to rest the myth that statesmanship is the monopoly of men.
62.	The SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, U Thant, as always, deserves our gratitude, support and encouragement. We are indebted to him for his tireless efforts in the cause of peace and justice. His is a continuing service to mankind and we wish him well.
63.	The United Nations is charged with the grave responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. To that end, the Organization is expected to take effective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustments or settlement of international disputes or situations likely to lead to a breach of the peace. The Organization is also charged with the responsibility for fostering the development of friendly relations among nations, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples. Yet another function of this Organization has to do with the promotion of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural and humanitarian character, and encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.
64.	These are the lofty aims and objectives of the United Nations and all of us, whose countries are represented here today, have resolved to combine our efforts to make these noble objectives a living and tangible reality.
65.	Yet it is a fact that many of us, for reasons best known to ourselves, have chosen to make a mockery of our obligations under the Charter. More often than not, we have adhered to the aims and purposes of the Organization more in the breach than in the observance. The tension, the injustice and the exploitation of man by man which characterize the age we live in are, in large measure, a function of the refusal of Member States to live up to their Charter obligations. So long as this attitude of mind on the part of Member States remains unchanged, monstrous crimes against humanity will continue to be the order of the day in many parts of the world. The principle of self determination of countries and peoples a principle which this august body has reaffirmed time and again will continue to be flouted with impunity in some of the countries represented here today.
66.	The enemies of peace, freedom and justice will stop at nothing to achieve their sinister objectives. They are everywhere on the offensive and are determined, as never before, to undermine the efforts of this Organization to build a world order in which respect for the rights of man becomes a concrete reality.
67.	The denial of human rights to which I have alluded, exists in its crudest and ugliest forms and manifestations, as I hope to show, in Southern Rhodesia, South Africa, Namibia, Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau).
68.	Southern Rhodesia continues to be Africa's inning sore. The year under review has yielded no evidence that we are to any significant extent nearer to the resolution of the deadlock in that rebel colony. The measures which the international community has taken against Southern Rhodesia have so far proved hopelessly ineffective. Even Ian Smith himself and his cohorts have openly stated that the sanctions policy is nothing more than a mere inconvenience. The declaration of a so-called republic in Southern Rhodesia early this year is further evidence that the rebels intend to stick to their defiant posture.
69.	As we assemble here today, the rebels are redoubling their efforts to turn back the clock of history. The course they have embarked upon promises nothing but continued enslavement of the black man in Zimbabwe. The most disturbing feature of the situation is that Britain, the Administering Authority, is doing next to nothing to bring the rebels to their knees.
70.	The time has now come for us to admit that the measures we have so far taken against rebel Rhodesia have not produced the desired results.
71.	In the face of rebel intransigence, the United Nations logical course of action lies in the application of the relevant provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter. Halfhearted measures like the ones the Organization has so far sponsored will continue to prove futile.
72.	The situation in South Africa continues to be a grave threat to international peace and security. In that country, the high priests of racial bigotry have given no indication that they intend, even in the far distant future, to allow the 16 million oppressed and dispossessed people of both that country and Namibia to have a say in the affairs of their fatherlands. Countless resolutions have been passed by this Assembly and other organs of the United Nations but there is still no evidence of a change of heart on the part of the descendants of the Voortrekkers in South Africa. World public opinion is ignored with impunity and every day that passes sees the tightening up of the fascist grip on every facet of South African life to ensure that the oppressed millions have no chance of effectively challenging the immoral and inhuman system under which they are forced to live. The pass laws, the Terrorism Act and related pieces of fascist legislation continue to be applied with a severity beyond description.
73.	The country's overall defense expenditure continues to maintain an upward trend. The implications of this development are very clear. It is to ensure that the frontiers of injustice are secure secure, that is, from the possibility of the ideas of freedom and human equality ever taking root in South Africa. One expects a Government to increase its expenditure to defend the frontiers of freedom and justice but in South Africa the reverse is true. Vast sums of money are spent each year to defend and consolidate injustice and oppression.
74.	That is the story of a country doing its utmost to cling stubbornly to antiquated and totally unacceptable norms of conduct in this latter part of the twentieth century. Zambia's posture vis-a-vis South Africa reflects our well-known concern for the welfare of man. We have condemned and we shall continue to condemn the perpetrators of the evil policy of apartheid and racial arrogance. We condemn, in the strongest of terms, the collusion of Western countries with the fascist regime of South Africa. The sale or intended sale of arms to South Africa by reactionary forces in Western Europe is a source of great concern to us. We therefore call on France, West Germany and Britain to refrain from this criminal act. The wider interests of freedom and justice in South Africa should take precedence over reasons of economic self-interest which currently dominate thinking in Western capitals.
75.	As a faithful Member of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, Zambia has supported and continues to support resolutions passed by the organs of those two bodies calling on Member States to render moral and material support to the victims of apartheid. We are firmly committed to the just cause of the oppressed people of South Africa and Namibia.
76.	The cost to Zambia of our opposition to apartheid is enormous, but we are determined to follow the course we have chosen because we believe it is the right course. Coexistence with the forces of evil in South Africa or anywhere is totally unacceptable to us. Apartheid is the very antithesis of what Zambia stands for both at home and abroad. We intend to remain true to our convictions.
77.	In Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) the exploitation of man by man, as is the case in rebel Rhodesia, South Africa and Namibia, is the order of the day. The victim, as always, is the innocent black man whose only crime if it can be called a crime is that he wants to have an unfettered enjoyment of his birthright.
78.	In an attempt to justify their atrocities in Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau), the ruling circles in Lisbon have advanced a number of preposterous claims and arguments. One such strange argument is that the Territories they now control in Africa are overseas provinces of Portugal and form an integral part of one unitary State. As we have emphasized time and again, no act of a Portuguese dictator can make any part of Africa an integral part of Europe. Nor do we accept the contention that fascist Portugal has a civilizing and preordained mission in Africa. That is an insult to the dignity of the African continent, an insult we are not prepared to stomach.
79.	The people of Portuguese ruled Territories in Africa and all freedom-loving people the world over do not subscribe to Lisbon's spurious arguments. It is therefore not surprising that the oppressed masses in those Territories have sought, since the early sixties, to liberate themselves from the yoke of Portuguese colonialism by every means possible. Nationalist organizations in all those Territories are waging a heroic and relentless struggle to achieve their freedom and independence.
80.	Portugal, as is well known, has reacted to the nationalist challenge by increasing the striking power of its military machine. It is, with the overt support of its NATO allies, waging what can only be described as a brutal war to defend the fiction that Africa is part of the Iberian peninsula. Through Portugal's colonial wars and unholy crusades in Africa, Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) have become more blood drenched than the Roman Colosseum in the days of the Emperor Trajan.
81.	The Government and people of the Republic of Zambia have refused to adopt an ostrich-like attitude on the question of Portuguese colonialism. At the time of our independence in 1964, my President, Dr. Kenneth D. Kaunda, stated that Zambia's independence would be meaningless, so long as any part of the African continent remained under foreign domination. We have not deviated from this stand. Both here and at the Organization of African Unity, we have made it a point to sponsor and vote for resolutions calling on Portugal to grant independence to Territories still under its barbaric rule.
82.	The system of government prevailing in Territories under Portuguese administration runs counter to the values we cherish in Zambia. The alien practice of the exploitation of man by man is completely unacceptable to independent Zambia. Zambia's role will continue to be one of firm and consistent opposition to Portugal until the Territories of Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) are free and independent.
83.	One of the most heartening developments in the past year has been the appearance of the OAU Manifesto on Southern Africa. This historic document was adopted by the Twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Western spokesmen praised ihe document as 'constructive', 'thoughtful', 'promising', 'wise' and 'humane'. I should like to observe with deep regret that there has been a tendency to leave it there. This attitude is obviously not conducive to the peaceful settlement of the southern Africa situation which we all desire. The response of the Western Powers to the Manifesto should not be to heave a sigh of relief and slip back comfortably into inaction.
84.	It is vital for all of us to recognize that the Manifesto provides us with our last slim chance of preventing a racial holocaust in southern Africa. Moreover, whether this opportunity is seized will depend more on the West than on Africa. The African States have done their part in extending the hand of friendship. It is up to the West now to grasp it eagerly and energetically.
85.	The Middle East is one of the hotbeds of tension in the world today. la that part of the world, peace is a strange bedfellow. Since 1948 over Twenty- years ago the region has been the scene of repeated military clashes between Israel and its neighboring Arab States. The last major encounter between the two sides took place in June 1967. Since then, sporadic fighting has been a characteristic feature of the region. The possibility of yet another major conflagration cannot be ruled out, notwithstanding the recent peace initiatives.
86.	The involvement of the two superPowers in the conflict, though somewhat indirect, raises the ominous possibility of a nuclear exchange between the two giants over the issue. Such an exchange would have incalculable consequences for mankind as a whole. A nuclear war could very well result in the extinction of all forms of life on our planet. This is more than a theoretical possibility.
87.	Zambia's stand on the tragedy that is, the Middle East has reflected our well-known desire for peace and justice in the world. We have condemned recourse to violence and have called on both sides to show restraint and to scrupulously observe Security Council resolutions on the issue. Ceasefire violations can only increase tension in the area and thus jeopardize the prospects of peace which we all desire.
88.	It is the view of my delegation that there will be no lasting peace in the region, so long as the basic causes of the bickering between the two sides are not given serious attention. The injustice the Palestinian refugees have suffered is the main source of friction in the region. It is, therefore, our considered opinion that in any search for a lasting solution to the conflict, this fact should be taken into account.
89.	For its part, Zambia will continue, as it has done in the past, to press for a negotiated settlement in accordance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967. We reiterate our firm opposition to the acquisition of territories by military conquest. We once again call on Israel to withdraw immediately from all Arab territories occupied after 5 June 1967.
90.	The current situation does not augur well for peace and security in the area, and we can only hope that the parties to the dispute will appreciate the need to cooperate to the full with Ambassador Gunnar Jarring, the SecretaryGeneral's Special Representative, in his tireless efforts to restore peace to that troubled part of the world. It is not in the interest of peace for either side to refuse to be associated with current attempts to find a lasting solution to the conflict.
91.	The intransigence and cynicism of those who have adopted a holier-than-thou attitude is the main stumbling block to the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in this Organization. The most disturbing part of it all is that those same countries whose representatives have energetically resisted any move to have the People's Republic of China in this Organization have chosen to remain silent on the need to get racist South Africa and fascist Portugal to honor their Charter obligations.
92.	My delegation has never been impressed by the facile arguments employed by the opponents of the admission of the People's RepubHc of China to membership of the United Nations. So long as they support forces of evil in this Organization we shall continue to question their right to block attempts to restore Peking's lawful rights. It is self-deception to cling to the notion that the People's Republic of China does not exist. China is a living reality, and there can be no doubt about that. Nor is it a wise policy to exclude that country from the dialog of man. The fact of the matter is that, so long as we treat the People's Republic of China as an international outcast, we cannot expect that country to be of any great help in the solution of many of the problems confronting this Organization today.
93.	If we are really serious about peace, disarmament and related issues, we must take into account the need to enlist the support and cooperation of the People's Republic of China. My delegation jvill, as always, spare no effort to ensure that justice is done to the People's Republic of China, because it is bound to play an important role in the international scene.
94.	One of the two superPowers the United States of America is fighting one of the smallest and poorest nations in SouthEast Asia. VietNam, which is currently the subject of the inconclusive Paris peace talks, has never known peace since the turn of the last century.
95.	The United States is in VietNam, we are told, to prove to the enemy that aggression whatever that means does not pay. South VietNam, it is emphasized by the self-appointed world policemen, must be saved from communist aggression, planned and directed, so the argument runs, from Hanoi and Peking. The ruling circles in Washington would have us believe that the VietCong and their allies threaten the security of the United States. This, as everyone knows, is a pretext to justify their illegal presence in SouthEast Asia.
96.	The conflict in VietNam is basically a civil strife and my delegation feels very strongly that external forces have no right whatsoever to internationalize and complicate local conflict such as this one. The people of VietNam should be left alone to fashion their destiny in the manner they deem fit.
97.	We renew our call to the Government of the United States of America to withdraw all its troops from VietNam and to enable the people of that beleaguered country to determine their future free from foreign interference.
98.	The crushing burden of armaments is one of the unresolved issues of our times. The world today is saturated with weapons of mass destruction. History has shown that stockpiles of weapons of war are not a sure guarantee for peace and security in the world. Weapons of war in the arsenals of nations can only serve to aggravate the already tense situation in the world.
99.	It is the view of my delegation that the road to international peace and sanity calls for the adoption of measures designed to rid mankind of weapons of mass destruction. There can be no lasting peace in the world as long as the nuclear giants refuse to accede to our just demands to dismantle their deadly weapons. Our goal is general and complete disarmament. Halfhearted measures like the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] do not offer man a genuine sigh of relief.
100.	One of the principal aims and objectives of the United Nations and its specialized agencies is, in the language of the Charter, 'to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom'. That noble objective, however, has not been achieved by the United Nations. It is an indisputable fact that the gap between the rich and poor nations has been widening with the passage of time. The material condition of the majority of the people of this earth has not greatly improved since the signing of the Charter in San Francisco in 1945. If anything, their condition has deteriorated.
101.	The failure of many international initiatives, including the First United Nations Development Decade, to achieve the goals of economic development is a matter of great concern to my delegation. As we prepare to launch the Second United Nations Development Decade, we should do well to ensure that we avoid the pitfalls of the first.
102.	One of the obstacles to economic prosperity in many of our developing countries stems from existing discriminatory practices in international trade. We have drawn the attention of developed countries to the continued existence of discriminatory tariff arrangements, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which entrench and institutionalize unfair trade practices. We have called for the liberalization and restructuring of international trade agreements, but all our appeals have fallen on deaf ears.
103.	The world cannot indefinitely remain half rich and half poor. Bold and imaginative steps should be taken to improve the lot of our people. Let me emphasize in no uncertain terms that, since the founding of the United Nations in San Francisco Twenty-five years ago, the more developed nations have pursued a self-destructive policy of economic exploitation of the poor nations of the world; and yet, in the final analysis, their own interests and those of poor nations are closely interdependent. In the interests of the whole of humanity, in the interests of peace and security, we solemnly call on the more developed nations to adopt a positive and realistic approach to the problem of formulating practical guidelines for the Second United Nations Development Decade. Stable peace is not attainable so long as uneven distribution of the wealth of this earth continues to characterize relations among nations.
104.	Finally, I wish to refer briefly to the Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non Aligned Countries, which my country had the great honor and privilege of hosting in Lusaka from 8 to 10 September.
105.	That Conference made very important decisions on the current international situation. The Lusaka Declaration on Peace, Independence, Development, Cooperation and Democratization of International Relations, which the Conference issued, is an appeal to sanity, and we commend it to all those who share with us the view that peace is one and indivisible. The Declaration defines the position of nonaligned countries on crucial issues such as apartheid, colonialism, disarmament and economic development and cooperation.
106.	The fact that that important Conference has taken place has proved that the nonaligned movement is not a spent force as our detractors would have the world believe. The Conference has demonstrated beyond doubt that nonalignment is now a firmly established and permanent feature of international relations. My Head of State will, in the course of this session, come to New York to give the United Nations a full report on the decisions of that historic and epoch making Conference.
107.	As we celebrate the Twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, we should take stock of the critical issues which continue to bedevil our efforts to achieve the aims and objectives enshrined in the Charter of our Organization.
108.	The world of the twentieth century is sadly fearful and divided against itself. It is, therefore, incumbent upon us all to ensure that we remove the basic causes of the mutual suspicions and distrust which have placed humanity into hostile and apparently irreconcilable camps.
109.	My delegation believes that the greatest challenge to all peace-loving men and women today in every part of the world is the task of providing international harmony, eliminating strife between man and man caused by religious differences, racial antagonism or ideological conflict. This, then, is the task that my delegation is committed to fulfill as we deliberate on various items on the agenda of this historic Twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We humbly and earnestly invite all the Members to share with us this spirit of purposeful determination to make this session a turning point in man's quest for peace on earth and goodwill among men.




"
25,1970,GHA,"121.	 I should like to begin by congratulating Mr. Hambro, as previous speakers have done, on his election as President of this historic twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly. The Ghana delegation would like to think that his election is a recognition of the contribution which his country in particular, and Scandinavia in general, has made to the founding and the stabilization of this world Organization, having provided two of its three Secretaries-General, not to mention such distinguished Scandinavians as Count Bernadotte and Ambassador Jarring, who have served and continue to serve this world body with singular distinction. I should also like to pay tribute to Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph, a woman respected by all, for the charm, grace and efficiency which she brought to the performance of her functions in this exacting office.
122.	At the commencement of the Second United Nations Development Decade which has coincided with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, the opportunity has again been offered to the Organization to devise and operate a strategy for waging the greatest and the noblest of all wars to ensure mankind's survival the war against poverty, disease, ignorance, and underdevelopment. It is an opportunity which we, the peoples of the United Nations, dare
123.	The second half of the twentieth century has witnessed one of the most fascinating processes in the history of mankind. Ideas of freedom and justice, until then reserved for a privileged section of the world's people, were suddenly let loose over the colonial world. The result of this was the decolonization process, as fascinating as it was inevitable, which our generation has been privileged to witness. Territories formerly serving as appendages to metropolitan countries took over the management of their own affairs as free and independent peoples. The United Nations itself, visibly transformed by this process, played and continues to play a crucial role in this process; its Marshalling of world moral opinion against oppression and injustice, its recognition that questions of freedom and justice for oppressed people were inextricably bound up with world peace, inspired and gave momentum to the process.
124.	Now the oppressed world is politically free but it must survive, and the United Nations is again being called upon this time to help add economic sovereignty to the political independence which the decolonization process conferred on the dependent Territories, We, the peoples of the United Nations, are being urged to take effective steps to ensure that Territories and peoples now free can, through self-reliance and buttressed by international cooperation, develop their own resources for the betterment of their own peoples. It is the moral duty of the peoples of the United Nations to ensure that the independence gained by former colonial peoples is not compromised and rendered a mere mirage by practices and policies by some of its Member States which tend to perpetuate the economic gap between developed and developing countries. It is the moral duty of the peoples of this Organization to demonstrate in moral and material terms that the decolonization process is not a meaningless fraud.
125.	In the view of the Ghana delegation, that should be the cardinal objective of the Second Development Decade.
126.	This Organization does not have to be reminded of the economic problems facing the developing countries of the world. The various structural imbalances which plague their economies, the imbalances In their transactions with the developed world, the constant deterioration in the terms of trade, as well as the heavy debt servicing crises, which afflict their single product economies are familiar to all of us. The people of Ghana, for example, have to live with a debt problem whose harsh and unrealistic repayment terms inhibit our ability to plan on a longterm basis. We have with a debt-servicing arrangement that fails to take into account the ability of our economy to pay and :hat refuses to extend the aid principle to the debt question, thus frustrating the objective of aid which some of our donors generously extend to us. We in Ghana have to bear a debt burden magnified by inordinately high moratorium interest charges which lead :o an indefensible increase in debt repayment obligations.
127.	Admittedly, the chief responsibility for the avoidance of debt servicing rests with the developing countries, but the developed creditor countries must also bear some of the responsibility. Their policies towards imports from developing countries, the distribution of their aid as between grants and loans, the policies governing aid they make available, including their almost indiscriminate guarantee of export credits  all have an effect on the debt servicing capacity of developing countries.
128.	One must also mention the hedging and equivocation and interminable delays that have characterized efforts to reach commodity agreements that would benefit developing countries. Added to that is the resistance to special tariff preferences for the exports of developing countries that seems to be emerging from he discussions on the generalized nonreciprocal and nondiscriminatory scheme of tariff preferences.
129.	So far the efforts made by the United Nations system of organizations towards helping developing countries solve these problems have been mere palliatives. The United Nations answer to these economic problems has been largely technical assistance and pre-investment surveys which, though useful, seldom lead to direct capital self-sustaining investment. Those scattered efforts have been administered by United Nations experts, some of them dedicated men, to be sure, but others of indifferent caliber who are often more concerned with their status and conditions of work in developing countries than with the effectiveness of application which they should bring to bear on their work in helping solve the problems of developing countries. The United Nations seems to be imbued with a lack of the will to strengthen institutions with enough resources to assure self-sustaining development in the developing countries. The United Nations Development program and the International Development Association, for instance, are languishing for lack of support from the very countries that can really make them effective.
130.	The Ghana delegation is convinced that what the United Nations needs on the threshold of the Second Development Decade is a bold and imaginative plan to set developing countries on the road to self sustaining development and to give a new sense of purpose and dynamism to United Nations development efforts. What developing countries need is assistance and a flow of resources on a massive scale and on concessionary terms, a development assistance plan not dissimilar to the Marshall Plan of old, conceived and executed after the Second World War for the reconstruction of the shattered European economy. Current resource flows to developing countries need to be tripled, or even quadrupled, if an impact is to be made on the almost intractable problems that beset them. The type of tariff preferences that are being discussed should be in relation to commodities like cocoa products, plywood and other timber products as well as textiles and textile products, products which are essential and meaningful to the trading activities and the economic survival of developing countries. The consumers of agricultural products like cocoa, coffee, etc., States Members of this Organization, should support any international commodity agreements on those primary products, otherwise, efforts by the United Nations in the Second Development Decade will be nothing more than meaningless sham.
131.	It is not being suggested that the effort involved will be easy. It should, however, be a concerted one by the developed countries, the United Nations system of organizations and the developing countries as well. With the developed countries it is, I think, a question of political will and a greater awareness not only of their moral obligations to the developing world, but also of the material and economic benefits they stand to gain from improved standards of living in the underdeveloped world. Each developed country will have to decide for itself. But, for any decisions to be meaningful, such countries need to consider agreeing to specific target dates for the realization of agreed minimum quantitative targets of capital flows. Specific commitments will have to be made with regard to the promotion of imports from developing countries, with regard to the terms and conditions on loans for development, and with regard to the alleviation of the heavy debt burdens being borne by developing countries. As to export credits it should be accepted that the borrower, the lender and the insurance agency each bear responsibility for ensuring that contracts are properly concluded and that they are in respect of economically viable projects.
132.	Luckily for the international community, there has been much enlightened thinking on the subject in recent times. The Pearson report,  commissioned by the President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is a historic landmark pointing the way to developed and developing countries and the United Nations system alike, to essential tasks to be undertaken in the immediate decade as well as those ahead. The delegation of Ghana wishes to pay a special tribute to Mr. Lester Pearson and his team of distinguished and dedicated men for the vision, compassion, and sensitivity which they brought to bear on their assignment and for a document which should define targets and set the pace for the Second Development Decade. The Ghana delegation accepts the recommendations of the Pearson Committee, and hopes that the targets and guidelines established by it will gain widespread acceptance and provide a foundation for the new development decade.
133.	There is the necessity for devising procedures in the developing countries and in the United Nations Organization itself to ensure that resources flow into the areas that will make a requisite impact. There is also the need for making the activities of United Nations organs, charged with economic development, more responsive to the requirements of the developing countries and to the tasks to be undertaken. These requirements have been recognized in A Study of the Capacity of the United Nations Development System, the Jackson report, which comes as a timely supplement to previous studies made with a view to reforming the machinery of the United Nations systems of organization for development tasks. It will doubtless be discussed in detail by representatives in the relevant committee at the appropriate time. I wish, however, to record that questions of national sovereignty and of the relationships between the various United Nations organs charged with development are raised by the report. So also are questions regarding the role which the Regional Economic Commissions, like the Economic Commission for Africa, should play in the United Nations development effort. The Ghana delegation wishes to emphasize that we must ensure that, while trying to solve these organizational problems, we do not create fresh ones.
134.	The idea that the United Nations system exists only to further technical assistance and pre-investment studies has now been changed in an attempt to give the United Nations a more effective role in the development of priorities of the developing countries. But so far, assistance from the United Nations system of organizations to developing countries has been insignificant in relation to the total development resources required by these countries.
135.	Furthermore, now that some substantial capital exporting countries are reorganizing their economic assistance priorities to channel a greater portion of assistance resources through international institutions, these institutions need to be so reorganized that the developing countries which they purport to help, develop confidence in their ability and intention to help them, and that they are not regarded merely as channels being used by the developed countries for imposing conditions for assistance which the developed countries cannot otherwise openly impose. My delegation would wish to believe that all controversial issues raised by this report will be fully discussed and resolved. We also like to believe that out of the discussions will emerge a United Nations system organized to tackle with determination and effectiveness the essential job of development in the decades ahead.
136.	My delegation does not have to overemphasize the efforts which we, the developing countries, must ourselves make to help ourselves in this and ensuing decades. We, in the developing countries, need and want massive resource flows to our respective economies, but we are, in the last analysis, responsible for our own salvation. We need to undertake a searching assessment of our needs and requirements. We must have the courage to take the necessary basic policy decisions and actions that will make the external assistance, to be released in the course of the Second Development Decade, to us effective. We need to cooperate among ourselves to widen our markets, to share experiences, and to renew our commitments to goals and ideals. We have in the past been the victims of much economic exploitation. We can in the future be the beneficiaries of the ideas contained in the Pearson report.
137.	We, in Ghana, have taken stock of our economic situation, and have set ourselves precise economic and social goals, aimed at providing a basis for self sustained growth with emphasis on increasing the production of food and industrial raw materials so as to reduce our excessive dependence on imported goods. In doing this, we are taking decisive steps to provide better housing, education, and health services, especially for the low-income groups, and to ensure, within our existing population situation, that the inequalities in the distribution of income and social amenities, especially between the urban and rural areas, are reduced.

138.	I would like to address a special appeal to the socialist States on the question of their participation in evolving the draft strategy of the Second Development Decade. We, in the developing countries and in former colonial territories, are aware of and appreciate the noble efforts which the socialist countries, notably the Soviet Union, have played in the decolonization process. In the adoption of a strategy for a Second Development Decade, the world is being called upon to complete this process by enabling the emancipated peoples to live decent lives, free from exploitation, poverty, disease and ignorance. It would be a pity and a source of great disappointment to us if the peoples of the socialist countries, who have done so much for our political independence, were now to enter reservations about helping us to complete our emancipation. The Ghana delegation feels that the reservations raised by them in connexion with the Second Development Decade, given mutual understanding, can be discussed and resolved and thus enable the socialist States fully to participate in this endeavor to which they have so much to offer.
139.	The influence and the leadership of the United Nations have been particularly effective in the realm of ideas, bringing the power of what may be called international morality to bear on the problems that beset the world. There was a time when it was thought that any discussion about colonial territories constituted interference in the affairs of the then colonial Powers. United Nations discussions and resolutions have changed all that. There was also a time when the most powerful Members of the United Nations maintained that discussions by the Organization of that inhuman practice of apartheid was an interference in the internal affairs of South Africa. World moral opinion has changed all that. It is now widely acknowledged that questions relating to violations of human rights constitute a threat to world peace, and that the solution of problems connected with them must concern the whole world. Similarly, in the economic field today it is being maintained that it is unrealistic to expect developed countries to undertake firm commitments in respect of resource flows to the developing countries of the world, but it is the hope of my delegation, however, that the evolution and implementation of a strategy for the Second Development Decade would give the United Nations another opportunity to demonstrate its resilience, confound its critics and maintain its leadership in moral ideas.
140.	We, the peoples of the United Nations, are on the threshold of a new adventure, a challenging one and one whose success will depend to a large extent on the moral and political will we all muster to support and sustain it.
141.	This Organization is commemorating twenty- five years of its existence. It is appropriate, therefore, to reappraise the record of the Organization during the period and to draw from it lessons for the future.
142.	The authors of the Charter envisioned an international organization which would guarantee the fulfillment of man's innermost yearnings for peace, justice and progress, to quote the theme for the twenty-fifth anniversary celebrations. It is, therefore, fitting on this occasion to reflect for a while on the achievements of the Organization. twenty-five years in the life of the world and of this Organization is not a particularly long time, but in that period this Organization has scored successes that have justified the vision of its founding fathers. It has succeeded in containing and indeed removing many threats to international peace and security. It has made a remarkable contribution towards decolonization, as evidenced by the fact that 51 Members founded the Organization, whereas some 126 Member States are represented here today. In the field of socioeconomic cooperation, the achievements of the United Nations have been even more remarkable.
143.	In spite of those, however, there are some problems which have caused disillusionment within the Organization; serious problems of peace and security still await their solution by the United Nations. States have not yet renounced recourse to the use of force as an instrument for the settlement of international conflicts. National arsenals continue to be augmented with both conventional and nuclear weapons of mass destruction. A dangerous war still rages in IndoChina; dependent peoples are still being oppressed in Africa and elsewhere; racial discrimination in its most intolerable form still persists in southern Africa; the disparity in development between the advanced and the advancing countries continues to widen. That is why my delegation feels that the United Nations must at this time address itself to basic issues affecting the future of the Organization as a machinery for promoting international peace and security.
144.	The Ghana delegation will not indulge in a detailed restatement of our known positions on the many outstanding world problems. My government abhors the mounting expenditures on the production of destructive weapons of war whilst half the world goes hungry, and it would support any moves that would conduce to a lessening of world tensions through peaceful settlement of political disputes. It is for that reason that the Ghana delegation welcomes the non aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, signed in Moscow on 12 August 1970. We lend our support to the agreement and commend it as a vital step towards a just political settlement in Europe. The Government of Ghana congratulates the leaders of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany on their foresight and courage which made this possible.
145.	In the Middle East, since our last meeting here in this chamber under the gloom of a complete breakdown of the Jarring mission and the Middle East ceasefire, the Rogers plan has revived our hope that a peaceful settlement of the Middle East crisis might, after all, be possible. In spite of the accusations and the counter-accusations by the parties to the Middle East conflict, I believe that a final and lasting solution of the Middle East problem, guaranteed by the big Powers and consistent with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, is a hopeful possibility. We urge all concerned to redouble their efforts in the search for peace and understanding based on the just rights of all the States in the area to a secure existence.
146.	The problems posed by Southern Rhodesia, apartheid and colonialism in southern Africa remain as intractable as ever and, in the words of our esteemed SecretaryGeneral, constitute 'the biggest challenge to the authority of this Organization'.
147.	Sime the twenty-fourth session, the situation in Southern Rhodesia has worsened. By a constitutional farce, Ian Smith has declared Southern Rhodesia a republic and has followed this by bringing into force a set of obnoxious policies similar to those in apartheid South Africa. That indicates unmistakably the shape of things to come. It also poses a new challenge to the United Nations and makes a reexamination of the instrument we have employed to end the intolerable situation in Southern Rhodesia imperative. My delegation hopes that the British Government, whose primary responsibility it is to suppress the Rhodesian rebellion, will take decisive steps to end the rebellion and resolve the issue in a manner consistent with the principles of the Charter. In this, I believe the British Government can count on the full support and cooperation of this Organization.
148.	Closely allied with the Southern Rhodesian issue is the liberation struggle of the peoples of southern Africa. On this issue, the Government of Ghana is committed and will always be dedicated to the cause of the national liberation movements all over Africa. We also accept the principles and purposes of the Lusaka Manifesto  as offering an alternative basis for a settlement of the southern African issue.
149.	As I have already indicated, any assessment of the record of this Organization over the past twenty- five years is relevant only when it leads to meaningful projections into the future. The SecretaryGeneral, in the introduction to his annual report for this year [Al8001lAdd.l and Corr.l], has outlined some of the basic questions which should be uppermost in our minds today. They include the means by which the United Nations can play an increasingly vital role in the world of tomorrow; how the United Nations can make a more effective use of its potentialities for reconciling differences between its Members; the changes that can be evolved in its methods of operation to attain a fuller utilization of its capacity for improving human conditions.
150.	It is the belief of my Government that it is only when we have found adequate answers to these questions that we shall have the right to expect the Organization to play a significant role in the next decade. In this connexion, it is worth noting that proposals have been received from Canada, Colombia and Finland, among other countries, on the guidelines for a possible revision of the Charter and improvement of the structure and methods of work of the Organization. Others, including the United States of America, have suggested that as a means of facilitating the peaceful settlement of disputes the Statute of the International Court of Justice should be revised to enable it to work more effectively as a court. Equally, we believe that any suggested review of the Charter should give serious consideration of the principle of universality of membership of the Organization. I may also mention in passing that in the past the use of the veto has come in for considerable criticism and there have been suggestions for its total abolition.
151.	While the abolition of the veto in the Security Council may be considered unrealistic in the present circumstances, consideration might be given to the possibility of defining more precisely the area of its application. It may be practicable to eliminate the application of the veto from Chapter VI of the Charter as well as from the provisions relating to the admission of new Members, while retaining it for the purposes of Chapter VII. The relationship between the General Assembly and the Security Council should also be closely examined. It might, therefore, be most appropriate to suggest establishing a committee to review all the suggestions and proposals relating to the Organization and working methods of the United Nations.
152.	In conclusion, my delegation hopes that out of the deliberations of the twenty-fifth session will emerge a new operational strategy for the United Nations commensurate with the 25 years' experience of the United Nations system. We are confident that any review of this Organization that may be necessary, as a result of the changes that have taken place within the international community, will strengthen the machinery of the Organization and enable it to fulfill more adequately and effectively its primary duty of safeguarding international peace and security whilst promoting the progress of all Nations in conditions of justice and universal brotherhood.




"
25,1970,PER,"1.	  Mr. President, may I start my statement by congratulating your Excellency on your election to preside over this Assembly. This is a just tribute paid your great country, Norway, which has contributed so greatly to the undertakings of peace of our Organization and of understanding among peoples, and also, at the same time, an acknowledgment of your own merits as a jurist and diplomat very well versed in the problems of the United Nations and highly qualified successfully to direct the work and the discussions of the present session of the General Assembly.
2.	It is a great honor for me, for the second time, to stand at this great rostrum as a representative of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru and to participate in the present general debate of the Assembly, which coincides with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. This has been a period during which the Organization has been able to make obvious its position as a primary instrument for international peace knd co-operation and for the encouragement of economic and social progress of all peoples. It is thus, following the lines drawn in the Charter of the United Nations and meet the fundamental interests of its component Members.
3.	As the Minister for External Affairs of a country which has just suffered the greatest earthquake of its history, on behalf of my people and my Government, I express from this rostrum our deep and sincere gratitude to all those peoples and governments which, in an admirable demonstration of solidarity, rushed to our support and are still helping us to overcome the results of that ghastly catastrophe. Such generous and effective co-operation must stand as an encouraging example of human solidarity.
4.	My expressions of appreciation must especially be addressed to Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph, President of the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly, U Thant, Secretary-General of the United Nations, his personal representative, Mr. Raul Prebisch, and also Mr. Paul Hoffman, the administrator of the United Nations Development Program, for their wide and comprehensive co-operation, which led to the very valuable international contributions and technical and financial assistance we are still receiving.
5.	At this moment, too, Peru wishes to reiterate its thanks for the generous initiatives taken by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Program, which the Economic and Social Council at its forty-ninth session has taken up and recommended to this General Assembly in its resolutions 1533 (XLIX) and 1546 (XLIX),
6.	The cruel tribulations suffered by Peru prove once again the need to create within the United Nations standing machinery which will be dynamic and effective and, provided with the necessary resources, can be immediately mobilized to assist those countries afflicted by grave natural disasters, thus avoiding the slowing-down of the process of development of the afflicted country.
7.	The catastrophe of last May hampered the immense efforts being made by Peru to find the road to welfare and progress. My Government feels that reconstruction and development must be considered inseparable parts of an over-all revolutionary process of transformation which cannot be limited merely to restoring previous conditions to the affected population. That would be to restore their backwardness and need. Rather, we should offer them a standard of living higher than they had before.
8.	Our people are determined to continue along the road of development that has been drawn for us and to make every sacrifice to achieve the goals we have set ourselves, for we understand fully that in the struggle against under-development and dependency there can be no truces and that from this struggle must emerge a new, just and united society.
9.	I believe that the present session of the Assembly is u propitious time for us at this center of world concerns to mention the progress that has been achieved in Peru through the revolutionary process.
A/PV.1842
10.	The Government's conduct in this period has been dictated by the urgent need to deepen the 
revolutionary process. In the clear-cut language of facts, based upon firm conviction and a careful and responsible analysis of our own realities, we have, in the course of the last twelve months, taken decisive steps which irreversibly show the radical transformation of the Peruvian society. In so doing we have only responded to the just aspirations of the great national majorities and the true interests of the country, because our obligation and commitment is and must be exclusively and whole-heartedly to the entire people of Peru. We want to put a radical end to the suffering and concern of our people by adopting effective solutions in keeping with the historic vocation that has been thwarted so many times.
11.	Taking up the doctrine of the Peruvian revolution expressed in the messages of the President of the Republic of Peru, General Juan Velasco Alvarado, I must say here that our insistence on independence has a very wide conceptual, cultural and ideological basis. We do not want to be, nor can we be, of those who repeat principles and outlines; we must be creators of our own way of considering our own reality, and our revolution must be a truly indigenous and independent movement with Peruvian solutions to Peruvian problems. And as we defend the inalienable right of Peru to decide upon its own future without ever allowing interference by foreign forces in our decisions as a sovereign State, so too we know, and will always know, how to respect the right of other peoples to assume the governments and systems they feel most appropriate or desirable for themselves.
12.	We have decided to find a road to development which will make the future Peruvian society a just and free environment in which the exploited and the forgotten of yesterday will at the same time enjoy a better standard of living and the benefits of culture, and in which economic welfare will allow men to achieve the highest moral values through spiritual development.
13.	This road is not blazed by the traditional formulas of capitalist or communist systems, for our ideal is a nationalistic and humanistic society that without alienating man will make him the conscious and free master-builder of his future.
14.	The construction of this just and free environment can only be achieved if the Peruvian revolution makes determined headway in the process it has drawn for itself of transforming the economic and social structures.
15.	It is for this reason that to the agrarian reform which is being carried out in an accelerated and orderly fashion we have now added the General Law of Industries, one of the most important measures adopted in the last twelve months. This law seeks and ensures a self-sustained and permanent development of a true Peruvian industry in order to guarantee the economic independence of the country through powerful tax, credit and technological incentives. At the same time it legislates for the participation of foreign capital and investments, assuring them adequate and just returns on the basis of the contribution made to the development of the country. This law, and another promulgated later, establishes the industrial community which is an original creation of the way of thinking of the Peruvian Revolution and will allow the progressive participation of workers not only in the utilities of industry itself, but also in their administration and ownership, thus fulfilling an effective means of social justice.
16.	Specific aspects of our own country call for State participation in certain activities and sectors that are basic and keys to the economy and development of Peru, and it is for this reason that the Revolutionary Government has reserved the foreign trade in fish-flour and oil and minerals, and also the refining of mineral products, in which, of course, private enterprise can also participate.
17.	However, social and economic transformations, which are sought through the reforms already undertaken and those to be undertaken, would be meaningless if their beneficiary, man, were not in turn the subject of a change that would meet our own needs also, that would meet the true situation of our society and the physical environment in which he moves, in order to make him fully aware of our specific situation as a developing country that will train him to defend and ensure continuation of the conquests achieved and that will prepare him morally and technically to confront the challenge that the construction of a new and different social order must also offer.
18.	This is the profound motivation which imbues the reform of our education. The achievement of its immediate objectives elimination of illiteracy, democratization at all levels, effective access for all to the scholastic, technical or university centers will gradually allow us to train our citizens into effectively responsible free men imbued with the conviction of their common destiny with that of other men.
19.	Thus the reform of education in Peru fully coincides with the objectives recommended by UNESCO for the International Education Year and also promotes ethical principles and the understanding of international peace.
20.	Concerning the battle that my country is waging in order to achieve development, I must refer once again to the question of the defense of the resources of the sea.
21.	Due utilization of the resources of the sea is a matter which touches us all, but most vitally the developing countries. This matter has been dealt with in a number of regional and world forums, where it has been reaffirmed without any doubt that States have a perfect right freely to dispose of their natural resources. This year, at the Montevideo and Lima Conferences on the Law of the Sea, the responsibilities and obligations which must govern relations among States were clearly defined; thus the signatories to their conclusions have laid a sound basis for the creation of just international co-operation, which must rest upon scientific, economic and social principles, and meet the imperative needs of peoples for subsistence.
22.	By the Declaration of Santiago of 1952,  Ecuador, Chile and Peru were the first countries to give a legal framework to their policy of defense of the resources of the sea by setting their maritime sovereignty or their exclusive jurisdictional rights up to a distance of 200 miles. After these three countries, the nine signatories of the Declaration of Montevideo of May of this year adopted a similar position.
23.	On the basis of the same reasons and for the same ends, a number of countries of the continent, meeting in Lima last August, declared the existence of common principles governing the law of the sea. At that historic meeting the Latin American States reaffirmed as common principles of the law of the sea, inter alia, the inherent right of the coastal States to explore, preserve and exploit the natural resources of the sea adjacent to their coasts and of the sea-bed and subsoil thereof, as well as those of their continental shelf and the subsoil thereof, and to establish the limits of their sovereignty or maritime jurisdiction in accordance with their geographical, geological and biological characteristics and the need for the sound utilization of the resources of the region.
24.	To those declarations of law and the proclamations of Latin American principles must now be added the resolutions adopted at the third summit conference of non-aligned nations which recently met in Lusaka.2 At that time sixty countries pledged themselves fully to exercise their right and fulfill their duties in order to achieve the welfare and development of their countries in ensuring the widest utilization of the existing natural resources in their territory and adjacent seas, and decided to co-ordinate their policies and measures for the utilization of their mineral and marine resources in the national interest and for the protection of the marine environment. This is patent proof of the progressive and reasoned stocktaking by the developing countries, which were kept by colonialism with their backs to the sea and deprived of the wealth which it holds, and which now understand that it is one of the main regions to which they must again turn their attention in order to extract the resources necessary to satisfy the pressing needs of their peoples. There is no doubt that the right to utilize those immense resources is strengthened by these adherences to the principles we defend whose general postulates are adaptable to the conditions and peculiarities of other latitudes and to ensure the legitimate protection and utilization of the economic heritage of other developing countries. It is for this reason that we understand and respect the positions of those countries whose jurisdictional limits over the sea are still different from our own. We consider that in questions of limits the sole satisfactory solution is the recognition of the multiplicity of regimes, if possible at the regional level, taking into account the characteristics of the respective nations or zones whose situations are similar.
25.	On this occasion I must state that my Government deplores and rejects the attitude designed to confound and divide States that are determined to defend these resources. I refer specifically to certain initiatives that have emerged to convene a new international conference on the law of the sea with an agenda that is one-sidedly partial and limited, intended to impinge on the inalienable rights of peoples that require the wealth of their adjacent seas in order to satisfy their vital needs.
26.	This session of the General Assembly has on its agenda a number of subjects dealing with the sea, and of these we should stress that concerning the possibility of holding a conference on the law of the sea, and that which refers to the sea-bed beyond national jurisdiction, without thereby overlooking the question of the pollution of the marine environment and related matters that have been examined by the Economic and Social Council. Those subjects could be considered either as fields fruitful for solidarity and co-operation, as we see it, or, as the opposite view would have it, as spheres of influence over which the great Powers might exercise policies of persuasion and dissuasion. This latter possibility is an evident danger that has become obvious in the last few months through the initiatives taken, which are being used in order to anticipate procedures set forth by the General Assembly and which seriously disturb and might even hinder the achievement of just solutions that would adequately meet the fundamental concern for welfare as the basis for peace, which is doubtless what is at stake.
27.	It is well known that the sea-bed beyond national jurisdiction is also a fountain-head of resources whose utilization is of interest to mankind in general.
28.	The international machinery to be created on the basis of a declaration of principles which is the primary task of the Sea-bed Committee if it is effectively to satisfy the general interest of mankind and not limit itself to a mere system of concessions to feed public or private enterprises of the highly industrialized countries must rest upon the basic concept that the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction constitutes the common heritage of mankind.
29.	Naturally, when such machinery is established for the sea-bed beyond national jurisdiction, the juridical status of the superjacent waters must be respected, leaving no room whatsoever for the application of norms that are alien to either part of the law of the sea. As far as the precise limitation of the area is concerned, we must point out that this is a matter that can be defined only by taking into full account the geographical realities of the different countries once the scope of the international machinery has been agreed to.
30.	The United Nations, which was born after the last war, has for the last twenty-five years been contemplating the great Powers opposing one another, particularly on ideological questions. On the one hand, the development of nuclear weapons has dragged the world into a peace of terror which threatens the two super-Powers with annihilation; on the other hand, the age-old cultural preponderance in the west of the European continent, is moving the latter towards an effort to acquire the deterrent potential and advance the process of its own integration. It is no longer an illusion to believe that Europe, ideologically divided and, until a few years ago, almost unable to conciliate its views because of the deep differences between the systems established there, might today overcome obstacles and difficulties to the point where a conference on European security is today feasible. However, there is no State which considers that such a possibility could become real without the agreement of the two superPowers. Both have allowed this new orientation to take root because of the mutual concession of substantial interests on the international level. It would thus appear that the shaping of world power might change from a bipolar system to a multi-polar system.
31.	Such a development in international affairs might appear equitable to those States that believe they are entitled to create the new international structure; how-ever, one must analyze the ramifications of this policy which affects developing nations, not involved in its devising, and which, as far as the great Powers are concerned, are only important in their effect upon their own spheres of interest. The multi-polar world balance, which is gradually being created, basically rests upon armed peace and the respect for spheres of influence which are nothing but those regions in which the developing countries are located. It is thus that world power is distributed among the great Powers and that there is applied to the developing countries a policy of economic domination which is the most reprehensible form of pressure on countries that are economically weak. And yet this entire picture is defined as so-called 'political realism' which is unceasingly proclaimed by the great Powers in their endeavors to persuade us all that that is the world political reality.
32.	At the same time, the United Nations is watching the growing emergence of the developing world. This new force has a different view of what international society should be, and quite justifiably condemns the entire contents of 'political realism', since the latter illegitimately tries to create a world power in which decision-making in the great international problems would still be left solely in the hands of the great Powers.
33.	It is not difficult to conclude that world international policy today is the subject of and rests upon the rivalry between the great Powers and the developing world. While the great Powers try to impose peace based upon power politics, the developing world is endeavoring to create peace based upon the political, social, economic and juridical aspects of that solidarity dictated by international relations that exclude the dictates of power. Only in the latter case will we be able to speak of true equality among States, because the elements constituting this concept of. united peace reject practices of dissuasion and persuasion which are inherent in power politics. Yet, despite the radical and profound differences between these conceptions, and in the interests of both, it is imperative to keep this dialog permanently open. But this can only be done by the adoption of positions that will create a new international network based on understanding, co-operation and mutual respect among States that will, in turn, contribute to the achievement of a true peace. Only within this framework advocated by the developing world can international security have a permanent meaning.
34.	This conception of what international security should be implies the participation of all States in the creation of an international order of a truly universal character. Therefore, the action of the United Nations must be to set its sights on that goal, which is the very reason for the existence of this Organization.
35.	On the other hand, the increasingly clear-cut analysis made by the Latin American countries of their own particular problems and of the general problems of the world gives us the conviction that we are called upon to play an ever increasingly significant role in the international community and to maintain the dialog to which I have referred, but along different lines from those of the past.
36.	The Latin-American consensus of Vina del Mar,4 which adjusted to its true dimension the dialog between Latin America and the United States, the Declaration of Buenos Aires, which formulated our relations with the European Economic Community, and the very intense analysis of our relations with groups of countries, without ideological distinctions, are a proof of the Latin American conviction and determination to strengthen on internal cohesive elements and of our capacity to assume united positions and our interest in creating or strengthening ties with other political entities in the world.
37.	At the recent summit conference of non-aligned nations held in Lusaka, in which I had the honor to participate as an observer, there was brought home to me the spirit of co-operation that animates the leaders of the countries which share that position and which, apart from giving dynamic assistance in the concert of nations, and which might well constitute the element of balance between the two great Powers that are at present confronting each other, is also potentially a force that must effectively contribute to transforming the 'balance of terror', which is basically unstable, into a fruitful, humanistic balance where the necessary participation of the developing countries will prevent decisions that might jeopardize the common destiny of mankind from depending exclusively and as a privilege on the great Powers. In that case, these decisions will rest, as far as possible, upon universal formulation and acceptance.
38.	These observations on inter-state ties lead us to consider the case of Cuba, that sister republic whose presence in inter-American relations must be a matter
4 Adopted by the Special Commission on Latin American Co-ordination on 17 May 1969.
of urgent consideration within the American regional framework,
39.	On the other hand, Peru shares the justifiable concern created on a universal level by the problem of the absence from this Organization of the People's Republic of China, a world Power consisting of hundreds of millions of inhabitants.
40.	My country notes sadly what little progress has been made by certain people along the road from colonialism to freedom, and the very insignificant achievements made in the struggle against different forms of discrimination.
41.	The end of the International Year for Human Rights has not, unfortunately, brought an end to racial, political, economic or religious discrimination. Nor do we see human communities subject to a colonial regime rising as free and independent peoples.
42.	Our ideological position, which is made manifest in our free and independent foreign policy, gives us the moral authority openly to reject that which our conscience reproves. This, once again, leads Peru to condemn the outrages against human rights and once more to reiterate the fact that the condemnations uttered against these aberrant practices will be meaningless unless accompanied by a' manifest political will to concert forms of co-operation in order, once and for all, to liquidate the forces of colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination.
43.	Peru feels that among steps towards the establishment of universal peace, our Organization owes praise for the acceptance by an increasing number of States of treaties on the prohibition of nuclear tests, on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and on the de-nuclearization of Latin America. However, despite the fact that the United Nations has repeatedly condemned the carrying out of nuclear explosions and that Peru and other countries have repeatedly protested against them, French nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean continue, and might create grave hazards for the populations and the marine resources of the coastal States. Peru wishes once again to protest and to insist that an end be put to these practices, which constitute an undeniable danger to mankind.
44.	Peru is following with grave concern the evolution of the crisis in the Middle East. It is for this reason that we welcomed with satisfaction the opening of the talks started in this building pursuant to Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of November 1967. My country shares the hopes of the international community that the day will quickly arrive when the peoples of that region will live together in harmony.
45.	Mine, which is a peace-loving country, is also deeply concerned at the continuation of hostilities in Viet-Nam, and trusts that the negotiations under way can, in the near future, put an end to that bloody conflict.
46.	Among the protests against the political, social or economic realities, we must include as one of particular gravity the terrorism and the hijacking of airplanes that threaten innocent persons with physical danger. In condemning those reprehensible acts, we must insist upon a search for specific means to avoid their repetition.
47.	All these grave problems which confront mankind today carry with them suspense and permanent risks in the critical situation through which the developing world of today is passing. The developing countries link their hopes to a true global strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade. But in the present stage of negotiations, while specific commitments on the part of the developing countries are clearly and definitively included in the document submitted to this Assembly by the Economic and Social Council, which places all possible emphasis upon the responsibility incumbent upon them, the same is not the case for the developed countries, whose commitments are drafted in an ambiguous or elusive way when dealing with precise targets and dates.
48.	And thus, in the light of the magnitude of the task to be undertaken and the negative results of the First Development Decade, the absolute need emerges for the strategy of the Second Development Decade to pass beyond the stage of watered down and half-way commitments and to concentrate on a firm and clear political commitment which will result from an effective and proven general will to co-operate and which will make it possible for the decade of the seventies to be, finally, the decade of achievements.
49.	The last session of the General Assembly decided that the commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of our international Organization should concentrate on three fundamental concepts of deep significance: peace, justice and progress. These three ideas, which in themselves constitute the traditional theme of the United Nations, are by their very essence an. imperative trilogy for the world to achieve the balance necessary to survive. These elements cannot be considered nor gauged separately, since they sum up human aspirations to inhabit a free world where peace will reign among nations and justice and progress among men.
50.	It is imperative that at this new stage that is now opening up in the life of the United Nations, our Organi-zation reach its full maturity after twenty-five years of vicissitudes.
51.	With the experience gained, we trust that the United Nations will finally be able to find itself and turn into glorious reality the postulates and tenets of the Charter which are summed up in those great themes of peace, justice and progress.
52.	This is the solemn moment to strengthen the action of the United Nations and renew our pledge to strive so that our people will achieve freedom and well-being, if we truly want these concepts to be more than mere meaningless words.


"
25,1970,RWA,"1.	  The delegation of Rwanda would like to add its voice to those of delegations which have spoken before it and congratulate you on the occasion of your brilliant election to the Presidency of the twenty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly. There could be no more judicious choice than the one which is made of a man whose brilliant intelligence, steeped in lengthy experience of international affairs, together with a remarkable sense of equity and moderation make him one of the best men of our time. Through you, Rwanda would also like to greet your noble country, with which it has most friendly relations.
2.	Our delegation would also like to pay a vibrant tribute to the prestigious figure of New Africa, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph, who presided over the twenty-fourth session with remarkable and smiling authority and an exquisite tact. The world and Africa owe her a debt of gratitude.
3.	twenty-five years have just elapsed since under the sign of the Golden Gate forty-three Powers, mindful of the horrors of a devastating war which in record time had just led to the massacre of 72 million human beings, without speaking of material destruction, and desirous of concretizing the collective reaction of the whole world and not only of the nations which had fought in the war against such barbarity, undertook to open up a peaceful era for mankind. On the other hand ten years ago the United Nations unanimously declared in resolution 1514 (XV) and this was unprecedented in history that the colonial countries and peoples had a natural and legitimate right to their independence.
4.	These two extraordinary events will be celebrated by the whole world during this twenty-fifth session.
5.	If it may be due to coincidence that these two anniversaries should come at the same time, what is not fortuitous are the deep-rooted causes which inspired the drafting of the United Nations Charter and resolution 1514 (XV). Both of them are steeped in the same firm will to undertake a crusade for the defense of human rights.
6.	On the occasion of such anniversaries, one must draw up a frank balance-sheet of this quarter of a century and this decade which are coming to a close, in order better to determine a program for the future, taking great care to see that ceremonial appearances do not make it impossible to find an equilibrium between the definition of noble objectives, which often remain only pious wishes, and the dire realities of the world in which we live today.
7.	In truth the United Nations has greatly contributed better than did the League of Nations to lead States, if they want this world to be peaceful and prosperous, to go beyond the narrow circle of their immediate interests to show a common interest in all the problems of all countries. On the other hand, throughout its existence, this Organization, thanks to its moral and political influence, thanks especially to the tireless devotion and the dauntless dynamism of its SecretariesGeneral, became a powerful rampart against any sliding towards new catastrophes.
8.	But unfortunately, every coin has two faces. After a difficult birth following the Second World War, the United Nations, which is twenty-five years old, is still very much marked by the personality of its main authors. We remember the many compromises which were adopted at Yalta in February 1945 relating to the greatPower veto in the Security Council. It is probably understandable that after the war the idea should have been born that the main responsibility for the installation and protection of a new political world order should be vested in the victorious great Powers and that they should have taken this opportunity of taking the best seats in this temple that they were building. And it is thus that the Security Council, in which the Charter vests primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace, became an arena where they become aware of their tremendous power, when the veto imposed by one of them renders the Council impotent.
9.	Obviously, the authors of the Charter did not predict the future which saw the great Powers gathered together in San Francisco with collective enthusiasm to sign the Charter and, a short time later, slide into an implacable war of influence to divide the world into two ideological blocs under their respective obedience.
They did not foresee either the massive entry of other nations into this Organization, nor the birth of other great Powers in the economic, political and military fields, nor the transformation of individual mentalities in the world and the appearance of other vital imperatives for mankind. Therefore this quarter of a century has seen such stages in the life of this Organization that it becomes urgent and indispensable to revise its structures so that it will be better able to respond to the hopes which the peoples of the world have placed in it.
10.	In the eyes of my delegation, the responsibility for peace in the world is a matter for all States. There is no more specious argument than the one which states that countries which are better armed should have pride of place in an institution which seeks not war, but peace, as if the happiness of peoples could be founded upon the sword rather than on a common will and conscience and desire to live together in a climate free from any fear or threat. In the present world, everyday facts unfortunately show that even if the highly armed nations did not take the initiative of a general war, the countries that are less powerfully armed could drag them into regional wars which also lead uselessly to large numbers of victims.
11.	Our universe is traumatized in several areas. The conflagration in Asia is far from being put out and its victims are numbered in the thousands. Everybody knows the cruel suffering engendered by the war in VietNam; we pray that its extension to Cambodia will not spread further to neighboring countries. We had hoped that the Paris negotiations would lead rapidly to a just and honorable peace for all parties concerned, but these negotiations are today in an impasse and the hopes of a negotiated settlement still seem very remote.
12.	And the Middle East? There again is a problem which is of great concern and for good reasons. It would have been a subject of great and legitimate pride for our Organization if, at the moment when we are celebrating our twenty-fifth anniversary, the delegation of Israel and the Arab delegations, thanks to the tireless efforts of Ambassador Gunnar Jarring, would have been able to show us the picture of a newly found fraternity. The acceptance of the Rogers Plan by Egypt, Jordan and Israel had given rise to some glimmer of hope. But unfortunately here again we are marking time and there is even the risk of a backward slide. In this question of the Middle East the role of the great Powers is particularly deplorable; similar to those who organized the circus games in ancient times, after having forged and sharpened the swords, they distributed them to the gladiators and became arbiters of this tragedy, taking great care not to break the balance of power of the belligerents. How could the latter then abandon their duel when those who arm them take the ultimate decisions?
13.	Rwanda would like to reaffirm the position it has always held that the solution to this serious question lies in the hands of the parties concerned and that there should be no foreign interference. This solution must take into account, it is true, the right of the State of Israel to a fully guaranteed existence and to secure and recognized boundaries, but at the same time it must recognize the right of the Arab States to the integrity of their territories. My country would again like to address an urgent appeal to the parties concerned that they abandon the language of weapons and violence and move without further delay towards peace.
14.	But there is also the problem cf China and Korea. Rwanda sincerely wishes to see these two nations find true peace, which is the sine qua non ambition of true progress for the peoples of the world. For many years the question of the representation of China has played its part in the debates of this Assembly and everybody knows the controversies it is engendering. In this matter Rwanda has never ceased to recall that the Government which lawfully represents the Chinese nation in the United Nations has never in any circumstance failed to discharge the duties which the Charter imposes upon Member States. My country expresses the wish that the problem of China, whose importance is obvious to all, will soon find a final solution.
15.	In the problem of Korea, we are also far from a solution. Everybody can gauge the anguish of a divided country and the advantages of unity and can therefore affirm that the Korean nation has no better way to progress peacefully and harmoniously than by reunification. The United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea in which my Government has full confidence, keeps us informed of the unfortunately very difficult stages that still have to be traveled before reunification is achieved. Everybody knows that North Korea does nothing to reply favorably to the relevant resolutions of this Organization. Thus it is still necessary to keep the United Nations forces in Korea, to encourage the United Nations Commission to persevere in its efforts and to continue the periodic consideration of this question in the United Nations. My country expresses the hope that one day the parties concerned will all show good will and facilitate the reunification of their country.
16.	But Rwanda, which was under foreign domination in the past and which today is the master of its destiny and a loyal Member of this Organization, must further pay a deserved tribute to our Organization which, at a capital turning point in the history of mankind, was able once again to assume its responsibilities by proclaiming 10 years ago the immortal resolution 1514 (XV) which recognizes to all peoples and all countries the right to self-determination.
17.	If, on the one hand, several countries have acquired their independence thanks to the implementation of this resolution, on the other, we see that this international sovereignty and this freedom which all of us are proud to enjoy and to which we are so deeply attached, are denied to thousands of human beings in the southern part of Africa.
18.	In Southern Rhodesia Ian Smith and his clique, defying the moral and political authority of this
Organization, have built a racist society where a white minority possesses all the rights of suzerainty over a majority of Africans who have nothing but the sufferings of slaves.
19.	In Angola and Mozambique Portugal constantly refines its methods of subjugation of the African populations, in flagrant contempt of the imperatives of universal morality.
20.	In South Africa the dogma of apartheid has become a State religion; it is obviously a true crime against mankind. The aspirations of the people of Namibia to self-determination are being stifled by the Pretoria authorities, who trample under foot with contempt the pertinent resolutions of our Organization. It is clear that if the sinister alliance between Lisbon, Pretoria and Salisbury is a very serious threat to peace in that part of the world, the United Nations, is in duty bound to assume its responsibilities in the face of such a situation.
21.	Oar Organization, inspired by the provisions of the Charter, has often taken decisions calling for economic sanctions against South Africa and a total embargo against Rhodesia. But, unfortunately, the deplorable fact is that the great Powers have been the first not to put those measures into effect, thus supporting the racist policy of Salisbury and Pretoria.
22.	The General Assembly knows full well that the Africans who live in those countries do not want war for war's sake; they merely claim their lawful rights in place of the concept that might makes right. All peaceloving countries which take pride in defending them against colonialist and racist oppression, in a document which will mark an important date in history, entitled 'Manifesto on Southern Africa', or 'Lusaka Manifesto,'1 solemnly proclaimed their will to seek a solution through dialog. At its previous session the Assembly endorsed the ideas expressed in this Manifesto and, by an overwhelming majority, adopted resolution. 2505 (XXIV). It is therefore essential for the United Nations to redouble its efforts, in cooperation with the Organization of African Unity, to ensure the triumph of the cause of justice and peace in southern Africa.
23.	The commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Declaration in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) must offer us an opportunity of stigmatizing, once again, colonialism and neocolonialism in all their forms and manifestations and must impel us to mobilize all the live forces of the world with renewed energy for the defense of human rights wherever they are violated.
24.	But the abolition of colonialism and racism, suppression of hotbeds of tension in the world and revision of the structures of the United Nations would not be sufficient to give to mankind a firm hope for lasting peace and security, since one quarter of the population of the globe accounts for 85 per cent of world revenue
1 Official Records of the General Assembly, twenty-fourth Session, Annexes, agenda item 106, document A/7754.
and leaves only 15 per cent to 2,300 million people out of 3,000 million inhabitants of our planet.
25.	Rwanda believes that misery and hunger in the world threaten the security of nations just as much as the clangour of weapons and we agree with the Pearson report that:
'If the developed nations wish to preserve their position in that world, they must play their full part in creating a world order within which all nations, and all men, can live in freedom, dignity and decency.
'International development is a great challenge of our age. Our response to it will show whether we understand the implication of interdependence or whether we prefer to delude ourselves that the poverty and deprivation of the great majority of mankind can be ignored without tragic consequences for all.' 
26.	After the end of the last world war, assistance of wealthy peoples to developing countries increased at a relatively satisfactory pace untU about 1960, enabling those countries to reach an average rate of growth of their gross national product of 5 per cent per year; but since that date this assistance has remained stationary, despite repeated appeals of the international Organization to the wealthy countries to devote at least 1 per cent of their national income each year to assistance.
27.	And yet the volume of expenditure for armaments in many of these rich countries is such that, if those Powers possess the material strength to destroy the world, they also possess the necessary means to free 2,300 million men from the chains of hunger, disease and ignorance. Why cannot the extraordinary progress of science and technology be used to make possible the utilization of the natural resources existing in most developing countries to improve living conditions for the populations of those countries?
28.	We are still very far from reaching the noble ideal which inspired the authors of the Charter ol this Organization when they stated that improving the economic and social conditions of man was one of the major objectives which all Member States should strive to attain.
29.	In fact it is the whole concept of man which must be considered. Quite often, political, linguistic, racial and other barriers shrink our horizons and prevent us from seeing that beyond them there is one mankind which, if it wishes to progress and attain happiness, must remain united and interdependent. Rwanda is convinced that every Government has a sacred duty to cooperate with all others in guaranteeing that all peoples have a reasonable chance of living in dignity.
30.	There is good reason for the revolt of youth in the world, for its cries of anguish against the obsolete structures of present day societies, and in a universal surge, for its proposals for a new humanism. We must draw the lesson from this general revolt and accept, while purifying it, the message of this youth which desires a new universal society. This youth, which is the society of tomorrow, is a fount of idealism and energy where all our present societies must find a way to regenerate themselves.
31.	Thus, the United Nations commemorates twenty- five years of existence. Its shortcomings, inherent in any human endeavor, must not blind us, must not prevent us from seeing its usefulness and especially the inestimable services which it has rendered and continues to render to mankind. It is up to all the Members of this Organization to see to it that it be further improved.
32.	But, more than that, we must have an ardent faith in this indispensable instrument of peace, which presages the genuine international society of tomorrow. That is what Rwanda fervently hopes to see: a world where all men, free from fear and anguish, will be better brothers and will be more united.


"
25,1970,IDN,"101.	On behalf of the Indonesian delegation, may I be permitted first of all to extend our most sincere congratulations to Ambassador Hambro on his election as President of this memorable twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.
102.	His election to this high office is not only a recognition of his personal qualities and accomplishments, but is also, I am sure, a tribute to his country and the Norwegian people. It is our conviction that his competent leadership, special knowledge of and experience in the United Nations will bring us closer to the realization of the ideals and principles embodied in the Charter.
103.	I should like to take this opportunity also to express my deep appreciation to the former President of the General Assembly, Her Excellency Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph, who guided us admirably through all the difficult proceedings during the last session.
104.	I should like further to pay tribute to our esteemed Secretary-General U Thant and express our appreciation for his patient and single-minded endeavors in the cause of peace, and to assure him of Indonesia's unwavering support towards that end.
105.	It was a great shock to me to learn upon my arrival here of the death of President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic. His death is not only a great loss to the Arab world. He has consistently championed the cause of the non-aligned and developing nations. For this we are greatly indebted to him. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend, on behalf of my delegation, my deepest sympathies and feelings of grief and sorrow to the delegation of the United Arab Republic, and through it to the bereaved family and to the Government and people of the United Arab Republic on the sudden demise of their beloved President.
106.	My delegation also joins me in expressing our deepest condolences to the delegation of Malaysia on the occasion of the passing away of Mr. Radhakrishna Ramani. May I request the delegation of Malaysia to convey our sympathies to the bereaved family and the Government and people of the Federation of Malaysia.
107.	This regular annual session of the General Assembly is marked distinctly by our program to celebrate the silver jubilee of this Organization. Speaking from a personal point of view, we find it a most happy coincidence that, as this august Assembly commemorates the twenty-fifth year of the United Nations, Indonesia too rejoices in celebrating the twenty-fifth year of its independence, the more so since this Organization played a not insignificant part in the final stages of Indonesia's struggle for independence. In this respect I should like to confirm the remarks of His Excellency Mr. Luns, Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, that the solution of the question of West Irian last year, through the good offices of the United Nations, has indeed strengthened the relations between our two countries.
108.	For both the United Nations and Indonesia it is indeed a time for sober analysis, not so much to reflect on our achievements in the past, but rather to measure whether we could improve the implements of the present to build a better future. This is the task that awaits us. The next generation has already reminded us seriously of this task when it met here during the World Youth Assembly. The theme 'Peace, justice and progress' should not merely be a commemorative trimming; it must be translated into a more tangible meaning to be fully enjoyed by the generations that will succeed us. These are their hopes and aspirations. We must not fail them.
109.	In assessing the present international situation, my delegation shares the views of many of the distinguished speakers who have spoken before me and expressed some degree of satisfaction on the detente among the major Powers.
110.	Last year we were heartened by the statements on the ending of the cold war confrontation, signaling the beginning of a new era of negotiation. We have followed closely the developments of the strategic arms limitation talks between the United States of America and the Soviet Union. The world will indeed be grateful if these talks can open the way to broader agreements on disarmament and related matters.
111.	We also welcome the German-Soviet non- aggression Treaty of 12 August 1970 as an important milestone in the history of international relations in post-war Europe, and as a concrete step towards reducing tension on that continent. Likewise we have followed also with great interest the preparations that are being made for a conference on European security.
112.	Hopeful as the foregoing may appear, we are, however, still deeply concerned about developments in other parts of the world. The Middle East crisis, which constitutes perhaps the most dangerous of our immediate concerns, not only remains unsolved but has even deteriorated.
113.	In August this year, with prospects for a settlement within our grasp, we were full of hope when the initial efforts of the United Nations mediator, Ambassador Jarring, produced a 90-day cease-fire. However, we feel obliged to express our serious misgivings about some of the latest developments, which have caused the situation in the Middle East to become more and more explosive. We have still time to arrest it. We began the cease-fire with 90 days in which to work. There are still 38 days left. Indonesia's position on this issue remains unchanged, and I can only repeat what I said last year. We feel that our vital interests are involved with the outcome of the struggle of our Arab brothers in the Middle East. We cannot condone acquisition of another's territory by military force. We believe that a just solution can be reached on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967. The withdrawal of Israeli forces to the lines they occupied before the June war, therefore, constitutes a key prerequisite for a negotiated settlement. Furthermore, no lasting solution can be attained without the full restoration of the inalienable and lawful rights of the Arab people of Palestine. My Government will continue to give full support to the further efforts of Ambassador Jarring, and it appeals at the same time particularly to the parties concerned to render him the necessary assistance and co-operation to carry out his difficult task.
114.	Turning to our area, the Viet-Nam war has been aggravated by the events of March and April this year in Cambodia. This led to the expansion of the war in Viet-Nam. Concerned about these developments, Indonesia took the initiative of convening in Djakarta in May 1970 a conference of Foreign Ministers of countries in Asia and the Pacific to discuss the situation in Cambodia. We did not presume that a solution could be achieved by simply convening a meeting. That would be tantamount to doing great injustice to the gravity of the situation. On the other hand, Indonesia was of the opinion that the countries of South-East Asia could not remain mere onlookers awaiting their fate while the exigency of the situation became more and more threatening to the peace and tranquility of South-East Asia as a whole. Something had to be done. The Djakarta conference was not designed to point the finger of judgment as to who was wrong or who was right. It was only to remind the countries and the international bodies concerned of their obligations and their responsibilities and to appeal to their conscience to initiate action of some sort which could at least alleviate the hardships and tribulations of the people of that region.
115.	Those nations that have experienced wars of independence, as we have in Indonesia, should be aware of the sufferings, the years of devastation and tragedy that the people of Viet-Nam have had to endure as a result of foreign intervention. And the latter pattern, unfortunately, has again appeared in the internal development of Cambodia. Here too, outside interference and intervention from abroad have seriously afflicted Cambodia's internal affairs. The Djakarta conference therefore demanded among other things that all foreign troops be withdrawn forthwith from Cambodia in order to facilitate the cessation of hostilities. It furthermore requested all parties to respect the sovereignty, independence, neutrality and integrity of the territory of Cambodia and to abstain completely from interfering in the internal affairs of that country. It also requested the co-Chairmen and all the participants of the Geneva Conference of 1954 to reconvene and to reactivate the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia.
116.	I may add that the summit Conference of non- aligned countries in Lusaka also expressed the hope that the Paris talks could help in finding a peaceful solution to the problems of Laos and Cambodia.
117.	Surely, those are not impossible demands. On the contrary, they merely reflect a fervent hope, a sincere appeal to the parties concerned to help to restore in that part of the world conditions that are conducive to a life of peace and tranquility.
118.	Another long-standing and burning world issue which, in spite of our untiring efforts, remains unsolved is the liquidation of colonialism. Admittedly, many of the once colonized territories now have registered membership in the United Nations as sovereign and independent nations. We must, however, not be blind to the fact that approximately more than 40 million of the world's citizens are still suffering under colonial oppression.
119.	In southern Africa, this problem has become even more aggravated by the condemnable policy of apartheid and racialism of South Africa, Portugal and the illegal minority racist regime of Southern Rhodesia. In this particular context, I should like to mention the cases of Namibia, Zimbabwe and the colonial territories of Portugal Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). If allowed to remain unchecked, such a policy may yet cause the outbreak of a racial war.
120.	Indonesia will continue to support the struggle for freedom and independence of the oppressed peoples and resolutely condemns the policy of apartheid and racialism now being perpetrated in southern Africa.
121.	Permit me to add a word on the question of hijacking as a most disturbing and dangerous means of political expression. Forcible diversion of civil aircraft in flight cannot be condoned as a means of bringing attention to a cause or giving vent to grievances, irrespective of their merits. My Government fully endorsed resolution 2551 (XXIV), and in accordance with that resolution is currently engaged in drafting a law on the relevant matter.
122.	I should like now to turn to some of the specific issues on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly.
123.	As an archipelago on the cross-road of two continents and two big oceans, Indonesia attaches great
9 Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, held at Lusaka, Zambia, from 8 to 10 September 1970.
importance to international activities with regard to questions concerning the sea in general, to the peaceful uses of the sea-bed and ocean floor and to the developments in the law of the sea in particular. We first welcomed the idea advanced last year by the United States and the USSR on a treaty on the demilitarization of the sea-bed and ocean floor, and we hope that a treaty to prohibit the emplacement of weapons of mass destruction on the sea-bed can soon be agreed upon.
124.	The question of the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction seems to be very complicated. As we had agreed last year, we had hoped to see this year a complete set of principles governing the use of the international sea-bed area which would form the basis of an international regime and the future machinery to regulate the exploitation of sea-bed resources. We note the different views of the delegations in the Committee  and the inability of the Committee to complete its task. But we also note certain areas of agreement. We hope that, as the Chairman of the Committee stated, a report can be produced by the middle of November so that we may be able to discuss it in our present session.
125.	The question of the representation of China should be considered in the context of the principle of universality of the United Nations. In this respect, my delegation would like to reiterate its position that the People's Republic of China should be given its rightful place in this world body. Based on the same principle, modalities should also be studied in order to enable countries outside the United Nations, including those which are still divided, to participate in the activities of the Organization and its agencies.
126.	My delegation is fully aware of the importance of the problems relating to disarmament. They are all aimed at strengthening international peace and security. Towards that end my delegation will continue to co-operate with other delegations when the matter comes up for discussion in the First Committee.
127.	Of pressing and utmost importance among the items on our agenda is no doubt the question of the Second United Nations Development Decade.
128.	Ten years ago the United Nations initiated a framework of programs to direct a major, concerted attack on the global issues of economic and social progress by launching the First Development Decade. Since that time, new institutions have been established and new measures taken, designed to meet specific problem areas. Despite these commendable actions, however, countless millions of people in the developing part of the world still suffer the agonies of hunger, disease, malnutrition, illiteracy and unemployment. In addition, these are compounded by the problems of race, urbanization, population pressures and the deteriorating human environment. The exigencies of these problems, both old and new, require an integrated approach to bring about their solution.
129.	A review and appraisal of the efforts of the last ten years have established that a major stumbling block to achieving the goals of the First Development Decade was the lack of determined commitment on the part of some industrialized countries. The reluctance of these nations to follow up their verbal endorsement of those aims with the political and financial commitment for their implementation is, I believe, rooted in their preoccupation with military and other considerations. This leads to an over-emphasis of the role of defense and security as compared to the other equally urgent requirements of economic and social welfare. This fact is readily evidenced by the disproportionate amounts spent by the industrialized countries on military expenditures, amounting last year alone to over $200 thousand million dwarfing the comparatively small amounts allocated as aid to the developing nations.
130.	We have come to realize and value the inherent connexion between international peace, social justice and economic progress. However, if nations continue to view international considerations in a limited perspective of restricted national interests, and if they maintain their present system of priorities, then the Second Development Decade will be doomed to suffer the same fate as its predecessor. Therefore, it is imperative that participating nations go beyond the narrow, nationalistic considerations which have, until now, governed the priorities of industrialized countries.
131.	If we are to solve the interrelated issues of world peace and global development, then we must adopt a broader concept of world order, and establish new standards and priorities by which to reallocate resources and to guide our future actions along the path of global development.
132.	Therefore, my delegation appeals to all the countries concerned, regardless of their political, economic or social systems, to assume this broader perspective of global order. Recognizing that the continuing, economic and social disparities prevalent in today's world constitute a volatile situation which threatens world peace and security, we call on the international community to resolve the problems of economic and social dichotomies between the developing and the developed nations. We urge all Governments to give their full support to the completion of the international development strategy and the launching of the Second Development Decade, in a spirit of true collective responsibility and international solidarity.
133.	Like the United Nations, Indonesia too enters this year its twenty-sixth year of existence as a member of the international community of independent nations. We have survived the sufferings caused by the normal diseases of infant years, including attempts to break up the unity and integrity of the nation, or even to change the state philosophy, the Pancha Shila. All those attempts met only with failure. The unity of the nation on the basis of the Pancha Shila has grown stronger than ever before.
134.	In the true spirit of the Pancha Shila we have intensified our efforts to accelerate the country's economic development and to strengthen our regional co-operation schemes. Special mention in this regard must be made of the the Association of South-East Asian Nations or ASEAN which has already entered its third year of existence. It is with satisfaction and deep appreciation to the other members  Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines that we should like Members of the Assembly to take further note of its progress and achievements in the economic, social and cultural fields. Our joint projects are well under way. We will continue to strengthen ASEAN, in the spirit of the principles of 'peace, justice and progress', and in the conviction that world peace is built on the foundations of peace with our neighbors. It is through the realization of peace with our neighbors that we can more positively contribute to peace for all mankind.




"
25,1970,LBN,"1.	 Mr. President, it is a particular pleasure for me to associate myself with previous speakers in expressing my own satisfaction, as well as that of the Lebanese delegation, at your election to the presidency of this historic session of our Organization. It is indeed a formidable task that we are entrusting to you on this twenty--fifth anniversary of the Charter of the United Nations, a time when, in varying degrees, we shall all be tempted to take stock of the work of the Organization. Who could assume this heavy responsibility better than you? Your brilliant career only serves to confirm all the hopes which we repose in you. You are also the worthy representative of the Scandinavian democracies which, like my own country, have always displayed their attachment to the ideals of peace, justice and liberty.
2.	I should like also to take this opportunity to pay a particular tribute to SecretaryGeneral U Thant, who has brought to his important task his qualities of heart and mind, his wisdom and his sense of equity, and whose indefatigable efforts to promote international peace and security fully merit our profound gratitude.
3.	This year we celebrate the twenty--fifth anniversary of our Organization. We should like at the beginning of our statement to dwell on the Organization's merits. Among its positive achievements which immediately occur to us we must, of course, point to the tremendous work of decolonization which, although it is incomplete, nevertheless has made it possible for many countries to become sovereign free States. Multilateral cooperation in the economic, social and cultural fields has very largely responded to the hope which the international community has placed in our Organization. We should like to hope that the United Nations Second Development Decade will open up a new era of prosperity and cooperation among all nations.
4.	Since the advent of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the adoption of the Covenants guaranteeing economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, the United Nations has forged a framework guaranteeing the flourishing of man and respect for his values.
5.	Although some modest progress in the field of disarmament and peaceful coexistence must also be accredited to our Organization, we cannot overlook its weaknesses with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security. Too many problems have remained unsolved because of the interplay of the politics of influence and the fossilization of the world into antagonist blocs where the national interests of certain great Powers have often been contrary to the legitimate interests of the small and middle-sized nations.
6.	The United Nations, born after the most murderous conflict the world had ever known, determined not only to eliminate the pernicious consequences of that World War but, above all, to spare future generations from a new scourge.
7.	twenty--five years after its creation our Organization has still not succeeded in attaining those two objectives. Indeed, the international community continues to suffer the pernicious consequences of that war, consequences which have been complicated by further conflicts. A quarter of a century ago the General Assembly and the Security Council symbolized, especially for the small countries, the supreme guarantee of a new international order based on peace and justice. Unfortunately, the Security Council has now become the stage where antagonism between the blocs is played out, thus freezing the positions of the great Powers and preventing the Council from taking the action that we expect from it. The French and Brazilian Foreign Ministers, in their brilliant addresses (1842nd and 1841st meetings), quite rightly drew our attention to the failures of the Security Council, whose resolutions have often in practice encountered a veto in terms of interpretation.
8.	The essential reason for the failure of the Security Council is principally the desire of certain Powers to settle international problems, not in the light of the legitimate interests of the peoples concerned, but more often in the light of their wish to maintain their zones of influence. Many conflicts have arisen since the creation of the United Nations, and at the head of the list we find the Palestinian tragedy.
A/PV.1844
9.	Israel, which is the source of this tragedy, is responsible for the convulsions running through the 
Arab countries today. Because of its disregard of the resolutions of the General Assembly, and particularly its refusal to implement resolution 242 (1967) of the Security Council, Israel continues to hinder peace efforts in the Middle East.
10.	The problem in that region has been prolonged distressingly for many long years. In twenty--five years everything* that could have been said on this subject has been repeated many times. Unfortunately, the aggressive policy of Israel all through these years has opposed a just settlement of the problem.
11.	If the United Nations had in good time taken the necessary measures to compel Israel to accept and implement the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council with regard to this problem, much tragedy could have been avoided and thousands of human lives saved.
12.	The heartrending events which are occurring today in Jordan and which have occurred in other countries in the region are only one of the consequences of Israel's refusal to implement the relevant resolutions of our Organization and to recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.
13.	Indeed, this continual refusal has tested beyond endurance the patience of this people that has fallen victim to repeated acts of aggression by Israel. For twenty--two years international public opinion has remained indifferent to the sufferings of the Palestinian refugees uprooted from their motherland, and yet people are surprised today to see these exiles becoming, in part or completely, fighters taking up arms in their own cause.
14.	As my Government has so often pointed out, Israel, by its threats and its acts of aggression, hopes to oblige Lebanon, under pain of undergoing more acts of aggression by Israel, to constrain indefinitely by force of arms the 300,000 Palestinian refugees to which it has given refuge on its territory and force them to resign themselves to the misfortunes of their exodus. Since 1968 the Security Council has been convened four times on the request of Lebanon. Warnings have been issued to Israel, measures have been contemplated, condemnations have been pronounced; but Lebanon today remains still vulnerable to acts of aggression by Israel, which always go unpunished.
15.	Accordingly, Israel by its refusal is seeking nothing else but to destroy Lebanon from within and without, and this by forcing Lebanon to choose between undergoing Israeli raids against its own territory and population and carrying out, with regard to its own brothers on its own territory, a continuous policy of violence and civil war. The harmonious synthesis which has been achieved by Lebanon is of a significance which goes beyond its frontiers. It represents, in the final analysis, the solution for many problems in other countries, including Israel. Internationally speaking, it amounts to the ultimate aspiration of all human beings to usher in an era of understanding and fraternal cooperation. If, because of the Palestine tragedy for which Lebanon is not at all responsible, any more than are the other Arab countries, and which involves justice and the authority of the Security Council, this human experiment which has so far been carried out successfully in Lebanon were to be compromised, it would certainly amount to a condemnation of the principles, the activities and the raison d'etre of the United Nations, and in the eyes of history it would be an actual step backward for mankind.
16.	The whole world is concerned today at the impediments which are now hindering freedom of aerial navigation. Lebanon, which profoundly shares this concern, as a country which is tourism conscious and itself possesses a large airline, has a particular interest in this subject.
17.	Moreover, of all the States in the world Lebanon is the one which has in practice suffered most in the field of air travel, by the shameful and devastating attack perpetrated against the international airport at Beirut by the regular forces of Israel, which, on 28 December 1968, destroyed three quarters of Lebanon's national civil aircraft.
18.	The same States which today hold themselves up as defenders of the security of international air travel should at that time have combined their efforts with ours in the International Civil Aviation Organization in order to take the necessary measures to prevent any interference in international air traffic. It is regrettable that our appeal remained a dead letter.
19.	During recent incidents which disturbed aerial security, slanderous and gratuitous attacks were directed against Lebanon. For humanitarian reasons my country was obliged to permit two civil airline aircraft in distress to land at the international airport at Beirut. Besides those humanitarian reasons, we did this at the express request of the airlines to which these aircraft belonged as well as that of the ambassadors of the countries where these airlines are based. Other States which possess resources far superior to ours remain even now impotent in the face of the hijackings of aircraft.
20.	We consider that all States bear a particular responsibility to safeguard the security of air travel. For its part Lebanon has now initiated the necessary legislative measures to adhere to the Tokyo Convention.  Furthermore, my country has undertaken to strengthen measures of internal security to give a better guarantee to the freedom and security of air travel.
21.	In this year of the twenty--fifth anniversary of our Organization, we remain convinced that the United Nations will be able to find an equitable and appropriate solution to the Middle East tragedy. Lebanon, a co founder of the United Nations, considers that our Organization is the primary guarantee for all peace loving and justice-loving nations, particularly the small nations, including Lebanon. In twenty--five years the principles upon which the Organization rests have lost nothing of their vitality and their power of attraction. Those principles remain the hope of peoples and nations. May so much reaffirmed hope not disappoint the nations which aspire only to achieve understanding in peace, justice and progress.



"
25,1970,IRN,"31.	Mr. President, it is only fitting that on this twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, a man of your stature, who has contributed so much to a better understanding of the United Nations Charter, should preside over our proceedings.
32.	You bring to this Assembly a distinguished career, not only as the representative of your country, but also as a scholar. Your works on the Charter have, from the very beginning, enriched the minds of the students of the United Nations.
33.	It therefore gives me great pleasure to extend to you our warmest and most heartfelt congratulations on your election as the President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.
34.	Our principal cause for satisfaction on this twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations is the fact that the Organization- has survived. These past 25 years have been the most trying and difficult period in world history. During this period, man has lived under constant threat of total annihilation.
35.	Conflicts have always existed in the relations among nations. However, conflicts in our age have assumed a more dangerous character. Under the shadow of the cold war and the nuclear age, conflicts facing the United Nations imposed a much heavier and a much graver responsibility than did those which plagued the League of Nations. But the United Nations, unlike the League, still remains a reality and the world's only hope for peace and security.
'36. We believe that the imminence of total disaster has further sharpened man's instinct for survival, making him recognize the imperative urgency for peace through international co-operation and conciliation. Thus, whereas the Versailles Peace Treaty of 1919 was torn to pieces within 20 years, we have now witnessed how the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union have succeeded in signing a Treaty which holds a promise of peace and security in Europe. It is encouraging that, in keeping with the fundamental principles of the Charter, this Treaty is based on the renunciation of force as an instrument of change in the existing conditions in Europe. We regard this Treaty as a clear expression of the recognition of the need for peace through international co-operation and conciliation.
37.	The recent initiative in the Middle East, which has led to a halt in the fighting and the reactivation of the Jarring mission, is indicative of another move in this direction. Despite the emotions, the complexity of the problem and the almost uncontrollable forces operating in different directions, a basis for negotiations was found.
38.	It is, however, a matter of great concern that after much painstaking preparation the talks are now at a standstill. The recent peace initiative offered a ray of hope. We felt it opened the door to a peaceful settlement of the dispute. It continues to remain our earnest hope that efforts to resume the talks will succeed. While the need for seeking peace and tranquility through pacific means should remain a cardinal consideration, due regard must also be paid to well- established principles of conduct.
39.	In the case of the Arab-Israeli conflict, those principles are spelled out in the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967/242 (1967)], which provides the basis for a durable peace with justice in the area. In this context, Iran was the first country to declare that acquisition of territory by force is no longer admissible. This principle was later embodied in the above- mentioned Security Council resolution which, inter alia, called upon Israel to withdraw its armed forces from occupied Arab territories.
40.	It is my delegation's sincere hope that Ambassador Jarring's efforts in this direction will lead to the realization in this area of the motto 'Peace, justice and progress' which we have adopted for this anniversary session.
41.	In the field of decolonization, the United Nations can rightfully boast of a great record of accomplishment on this tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.
42.	Largely through the power of persuasion and concerted action of this Assembly, millions of people who languished under the colonial yoke have attained freedom and independence. They have taken their rightful place in the community of nations.
43.	While we must rejoice in this phenomenal development, we must at the same time express our concern for the freedom of the remaining colonial peoples, and vigilance should continue to be our guide until all territories under colonial rule are free again.
44.	Much still remains to be achieved in the field of disarmament. But we must acknowledge that some progress has been made. The signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] was a landmark in the long, barren and difficult negotiations.
45.	To facilitate matters further in the implementation of this Treaty to which we soon become a party, as my beloved Sovereign, His Imperial Majesty the Shahinshah Aryamehr, has mentioned on a number of occasions, Iran is ready to declare the Middle East a nuclear-free zone, should other countries of the area agree to do so. The strategic arms limitation talks constitute another important step forward. While we welcome these measures, we would also like to express the hope that, in accordance with our Charter, the United Nations will be kept in the picture at all times during all phases of negotiations on disarmament.
46.	I have especially outlined some of the positive aspects of developments in international affairs to show that prospects for peace and security during the next 25 years are far brighter than they were at the inception of the United Nations. This is so despite the set-backs, frustrations and failures of which we are all well aware and which have greatly damaged the effectiveness of our Organization.
47.	There is much that is urgent on our agenda, and much that is not on our agenda is even more urgent. I hope that at the present moment of crisis nothing will be said or done here to aggravate the perils which threaten the world in the Middle East and Far East.
48.	While, my Government will be expressing its views on the various items of the agenda in the Committees, I should like here to refer to certain items that are of particular interest to us.
49.	As usual, development heads the list. I am sorry to say that the First United Nations Development Decade has been a failure. We had hoped that the developed nations, which had originally committed themselves to the basic objectives of that Development Decade, would play their full part in the realization of its objectives. While we recognize the difficulties which may have confronted them, we nevertheless firmly believe that a contribution of 1 per cent of national income would not impose a heavy burden on them.
50.	On the eve of the Second Development Decade the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen at a rapid rate. Unless that trend is checked in time it will be impossible to bridge the gap without serious consequences. The Second Development Decade offers a challenge, and it is our earnest hope that developed nations will assume their full responsibility in meeting that challenge. Here I must point out that the developed countries cannot absolve themselves of their responsibility for the dangerous implications that might result should the Second Development Decade fail.
51.	Much has been said, and will be said, of the work of the United Nations Development program, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and other^, to which we attach great importance. Our views on the work of these organizations are well known. I therefore do not wish to tax your patience by repeating them. However, I do wish to say a few words on how we are to exploit the resources of the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.
52.	We firmly believe that the fruits of exploitation must be devoted to the common interest and allocated in the first place to the needs of development. In theory, the sea and atmosphere can be divided into marginal waters and international waters, air space and outer space. But the environment cannot be divided by national frontiers; abuses in one part are bound to have an effect on the other parts.
53.	i should now like to turn to the question of security in our immediate region. In describing what is required for peace in the world I mentioned earlier that peace is possible only through international co-operation and conciliation. I venture to say th it in our case these are no high-sounding words devoid of real meaning. They constitute the corner-stone of our independent national policy . In essence this policy is based on peaceful coexistence and non-interference in the internal affairs of others.
54.	We follow that policy with regard to all countries in every region, irrespective of their social or political -systems. In the Middle East, our own region, we naturally take a keener interest in the application of that policy. In this area* an important step was recently taken, and the way was paved for a better understanding with the Government of the United Arab Republic. It gives me pleasure to report that relations with the United Arab Republic have been resumed. That opens the way for greater co-operation and for the consolidation of the deep-rooted ties between our two peoples.
55.	The best example of our sincere and genuine desire for peace with justice through international conciliation, co-operation and understanding is the recent settlement of the question of Bahrain. In this day and age, when force still appears to be the main recourse of nations in the defense of national interests, we chose peaceful settlement as the means of resolving our differences with the United Kingdom on the question of Bahrain, to which we attached the greatest importance. That question had remained unresolved for a century and a half. The imminent departure of the United Kingdom forces from the Persian Gulf area provided a favorable atmosphere for a further effort to be made towards the solution of the problem.
56.	Although the question of Bahrain was closely linked to our national interests we nevertheless felt that it was only just and fair that after a century and a half of separation from us the wishes of the people should be determined. Accordingly, we decided to seek the good offices of the Secretary-General, to whom I must pay a high tribute in this regard. To facilitate matters further, and as a sign of our good intentions, we took the unusual step of accepting in advance the findings of the Secretary-General's personal representative provided they were endorsed by the Security Council. On 11 May 1970[1536th meeting]the, Security Council endorsed the report submitted by the Secretary-General's personal representative.  Subsequently, Iran declared its acceptance.
57.	Seldom have Governments shown readiness to submit questions of national interest to the judgment and action of bodies outside their own control. In this instance, consideration for the common good, in conformity with the basic principles of the Charter, prevailed over self-oriented policies. By having recourse to the machinery of the United Nations we have shown how effective the United Nations system can be in the peaceful settlement of international disputes, provided Member States abide by the purposes and principles of the Charter.
58.	In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General states: 'The Bahrain settlement is a striking example of how the good offices of the Secretary-General can be used for the peaceful settlement of international disputes'. [A18001 /Add.l and Corr.l, para. 14]. Moreover, the settlement of the Bahrain issue has opened up a noble and new vista in which peace, progress and concerted efforts for the common good would characterize relations not only between Iran and our Bahraini brothers but all States and emirates in the Persian Gulf area.
59.	With the entire northern coastline of the Persian Gulf belonging to Iran, my Government naturally attaches particular importance to peace and stability in that area. To that end we have spared no effort to co-operate with other littoral States and emirates.
60.	The declaration of. the British Government to withdraw from the Persian Gulf region which, of course, we welcomed whole-heartedly, cleared the way for such regional co-operation for the maintenance of peace and stability in this area.
61.	I would have preferred to remain silent on our differences with Iraq, which happen to be the only sore spot in the relations with our neighbor. But His Excellency the Foreign Minister of Iraq yesterday [1854th meeting] chose to rehash the same old story, which he recounted to this Assembly last year. He himself concedes that he has nothing new to say this year on this subject.
> 62. Most of what I have to say, in order to disabuse this Assembly about baseless charges, is in fact also found in the records of the General Assembly. I wish only to declare once again that the 1937 Treaty  is nothing but a dead letter now.
63.	The 1937 Treaty is dead, not because of Iran, but through the action, or inaction, of Iraq. For 32 years all our efforts to persuade Iraq to live up to its obligations under the Treaty were of no avail. By its persistent refusal to honor a substantial part of the 1937 Treaty, namely, articles 4 and 5, and article 2 of the Protocol annexed to the Treaty, the Government of Iraq in effect rendered the whole Treaty null and void.
64.	We cannot tolerate the legacy of imperialism in any form, nor will we accept Iraq as an heir to colonialism. The era of colonialism is over. Shatt-el-Arab, as a border river, is as much ours as it is Iraq's. We do not demand exclusive domain over it. We seek no more than is accorded to us by the practice of nations under well-established rules of international law, as shown in the case of the Danube, the Rhine and the Scheldt rivers.
65.	Let me recount how the crisis between our two countries started. A few hours after midnight, on 15 April 1969, the Ambassador of Iran in Baghdad was awakened, to be officially notified by the Deputy
Foreign Minister of Iraq that Iraq would use force against vessels sailing to Iranian ports flying the Iranian national flag. Iraq went so far as to threaten to lower the Iranian flag if Iranian merchant vessels were to refuse Iraqi demands. To make its threat appear real, the Iraqi Government concentrated the bulk of its military forces along Shatt-el-Arab, facing Iran.
66.	Under the circumstances, Iran was left no choice but to take firm measures to defend its sovereign rights by sending troop contingents to the border, which took place eight to nine weeks after Iraq sent its troops to the border. Subsequently, a number of countries, including Kuwait, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Jordan, offered to mediate between Iran and Iraq. We responded positively to those overtures and we made it clear that as soon as Iraq sent its troops back to their barracks, we would do the same. Unfortunately, the Iraqi Government failed to respond. What could have been the reason for Iraq's refusal? I believe the answer has now become clear. Was it not because it wanted to have its forces on secure and safe frontiers?
67.	To sum up my remarks on this subject, as I have stated in this Assembly, and as the Permanent Representative of Iran has informed the President of the Security Council several times, we are ready at any time, at any hour, at any moment, anywhere, to start negotiations with the Government of Iraq, for the purpose of reaching a peaceful settlement of the Shatt- el-Arab dispute, on the basis of the boundary to be set at mid-channel on thalweg and freedom of navigation for all countries throughout the entire river, in accordance with the accepted principles of international law.
68.	We remain faithful to the pledge made several years ago by His Imperial Majesty Shahinshah Aryamehr to contribute to the peace-keeping resources of the United Nations.
69.	The crises of our times give new proof each year of the importance of putting the peace-keeping function of the United Nations on a solid and permanent footing. We hope other nations will join those of us who have already done so, in earmarking troop contingents for this purpose. Realization of the end in view now depends mainly on decisive action by the superPowers.
70.	The Charter places on us the responsibility of helping to build a world in which those who come after us will feel safe and happy, materially and spiritually. That means enlisting youth activities in the cause of the United Nations. My august Sovereign saw this need early, and was the first to press the United Nations to act upon it. It is to his foresight and initiative that we owe the recommendation now before us from the Economic and Social Council [resolution 1539 (XLIX)] to establish a United Nations volunteer corps. We regard this as only a beginning of what will eventually be an important part of the United Nations structure.
71.	Our goal must be a world of enduring peace, and universal prosperity and opportunity, with ambition for diversity. That appears to be our children's ideal. Let us make it our own.




"
25,1970,IRQ,"
133.	I should like, on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Iraq, to extend our sincere congratulations to Ambassador Hambro on his election to preside over the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.
134.	His election to this high office on this very historic occasion is an acknowledgment by the international community of his excellent qualities and high ability, which will no doubt be of great service to this Organization and will contribute to the success of this important session. It is also an appreciation of the qualities of his country, Norway.
135.	I would have liked to begin my statement at this historic session, in which we are evaluating the achievements of the United Nations through a quarter of a century of its life, with a tone of optimism that could refresh the hopes which the various nations pinned on the Organization when it was set up. But the atmosphere of anxiety and danger, and the tragedy suffered by oar part of the world in particular as a result of the imperialistZionist aggression, do not leave us with such an opportunity, unless we choose to speak at the expense of ignoring the actual state of affairs.
136.	During the past few days our part of the world has witnessed tragic events, the consequences and echo of which transcended its boundaries and thus became the focus of world attention and concern. Despite the dangerous implications and the heartrending aspects of these events, they are no more than another link in the chain of tragedies which the people of Palestine is going through.
137.	We are at a great historical turning-point which will determine for coming decades the extent of the ability of international society and the world Organization to restore usurped rights and permanent and just peace instead of allowing war and destruction to go on. It is imperative to put the Middle East problem into its correct perspective if we are to achieve a complete understanding of the dangerous crisis and seek a just solution.
138.	There are two aspects to this crisis, the differences between which can clearly be distinguished if one is objective, despite attempts to confuse them.
139.	The first aspect is the Zionist aggression on the rights of the Palestinian people, which originated under British colonial rule more than sixty years ago, and which, thanks to the forces of imperialism led by the United States, was crowned with the establishment of the Zionist imperialist enclave on the land of Palestine, whose people were consequently evicted from their lands, and thereby deprived of their right to self determination.
140.	The second aspect is the Israeli aggression on 5 June 1967, which resulted in the occupation of Arab territories, of three United Nations Member States, namely, Egypt, Syria and Jordan   an occupation which has continued up to the present day. This Israeli aggression, which is an inevitable consequence of the expansionist nature of the Zionist enclave, is a flagrant and grave violation of the United Nations Charter, which deplores and condemns aggression and does not recognize any gain resulting from the threat or use of force. Thus, the condemnation of Israel, and the ordering of its complete and unconditional withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, is the sole action which the United Nations and the Security Council should have taken to protect international peace and security and ensure compliance with international law and the Charter of the world Organization. But such has not been the case, although more than three years have elapsed since Israel occupied Arab lands and began to establish new settlements therein. This lawless action led to the displacement of more Arab populations in addition to the hundreds of thousands of people of Palestine who have already been living in wretched conditions for over twenty- years. The failure of the world Organization and the Security Council to adopt a resolution in accordance with Article 24 of the Charter stems from the deplorable fact that a superPower, a permanent member of the Security Council, firmly supports aggression and impedes its liquidation.
141.	When the United States continuously declares through its highly responsible officials that it intends to preserve the present ceasefire lines between Israel and the Arab States, that means that it will protect Israeli aggression lines and Israel's aggressive gains.
142.	When the United States declares that it will preserve the present balance of power between the Arab States and Israel, this means it will preserve the Israeli military superiority which protects Israel's expansionist designs in the occupied Arab territories. By the same token the United States is responsible for the eviction of more of the people of Palestine and participates in preventing their return to their homeland.
143.	When the United States supplies Israel with fifty Phantom jet planes and promises to give more, and when, as it did recently, it grants Israel a loan for military equipment of 450 million dollars, it means that the United States is directly and effectively responsible for the massacre of Arab workers in their factories and Egyptian children in their schools.
144.	Thus the Arab nation, in defense of its rights, not only is dealing with Israel but has to confront the colossal war machine of the United States.
145.	The United States and Israel intend to use the acquisitions of the 1967 aggression to force the Arab nation to accept and submit to the crime of 1948, when the people of Palestine were evicted from their homeland and prevented from exercising their right to self determination and sovereignty.
146.	Standing strongly and decidedly by the side of sister Arab States in their effort to liberate their territories, Iraq reaffirms once again that the continuation of the so-called 'Middle East crisis', and the dangers to international peace and security resulting therefrom, are a direct consequence of the debarring of the Palestinian people from the exercise of their natural rights in their homelands. Iraq is firmly determined to support unreservedly the struggle of the Palestinians for their legitimate rights.
147.	The Iraqi Republic, being fully conscious of the importance of the present situation in the Middle East to international peace and security, believes that a just peace   which is aspired to not only by the Arab nation but by all nations of the world   is unattainable without the full recognition of the rights of the people of Palestine, and their participation as a direct party in the solution of a problem which they alone have the inalienable right to decide upon. Plans that seek to impose the consequences of aggression upon our nation and ignore the right of the people of Palestine to a natural existence will only bring further tragedies and will end in total failure.
148.	The recent massacres which Amman and the rest of Jordan have witnessed, in which thousands of innocent lives were sacrificed, bear tragic witness to the consequences and fate of such plans. The suspicious role of the United States in this massacre was fully and clearly shown when it alerted its troops and navy and began to issue threatening announcements of its intention to intervene. These events abundantly vindicated our belief that a fundamental price of the so-called American peace initiative is the complete liquidation of the people of Palestine and their heroic resistance.
149.	The Palestinian problem has been an item on the United Nations agenda for the last twenty- years. Numerous resolutions, varying in the depth of their understanding of the problem, have been adopted. However the twenty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly took an important and fundamental step in understanding the reality of the Middle East crisis by adopting resolution 2535 B (XXIV), which reaffirms the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine. Despite the fact that a year has elapsed since the adoption of that important resolution, no positive measures have been taken to implement it, as is the case with all the resolutions concerning the rights of the Palestinians. But the mere adoption of this resolution represents a turning point in the understanding of the Palestine question by the world community. It has put the Palestine question in its proper perspective because it has dealt with both cause and effect instead of merely concentrating upon the consequences. The affirmation of the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine was an eloquent and humane expression of the appreciation and recognition by the international community of the long process of struggle and sacrifice endured by the Palestinian people and their valiant resistance.
150.	Needless to say, the Republic of Iraq considers the Palestine issue a cornerstone of its foreign policy. It is, in fact, participating fully and effectively in the exorbitant price which the Arab nation is paying for Zionist-imperialist aggression. Therefore, Iraq declares its firm determination to continue to render every possible assistance and support to the brave and valiant Palestine resistance. Moreover, the resistance movement proved under all circumstances its ability to grow, to perpetuate its struggle and to deepen its roots in the conscience of the Palestine people. In the view of the Iraqi Government, this movement is the sole legitimate representative of the aspirations of the people of Palestine, and the only party which has the right to speak on their behalf. The delegation of Iraq to the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly appeals from this rostrum to all States and nations valuing freedom and striving for peace and justice to foster the legitimate aspirations of the people of Palestine to self-determination and sovereignty in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.
151.	I intimated to the General Assembly during its last session [1777th meeting] the positive dangers arising from the crisis created by neighboring Iran in its attempt to abrogate the IraqiIranian Boundary Treaty of 1937. This Treaty decided once and for all the status of the riparian and land boundaries between Iraq and Iran in order to put an end to any controversy or dispute in this respect.
152.	Needless to say, such a treaty cannot be unilaterally abrogated on any of the grounds authoritatively established in international law. I informed the Assembly of the Iranian military buildup along our boundaries and the violations of Iraqi territorial sovereignty. Moreover, I demonstrated that such acts constitute a grave breach of the principle of respect for the sanctity of treaties, international obligations and the United Nations Charter. Good neighborliness between Iraq and Iran requires that our neighbor should disclaim its illegal acts and demonstrate respect for its international obligations. I also stated last year that the Iraqi Government, which firmly believes in the peaceful settlement of international disputes, is ready to accept a decision from the International Court of Justice in connexion with any controversy that might arise from the application of the 1937 Boundary Treaty. But, instead of responding to this reasonable logic and responsible attitude, Iran persisted in its illegal acts and violations of Iraq's sovereignty. What is more, our eastern frontier witnessed last year a dangerous and explosive situation due to the increasing Iranian military buildup aid the flagrant and dangerous violations of Iraq's sovereignty.
153.	Iraq, nevertheless, has adhered to the policy of self-restraint in the face of these continuous provocations, in the hope that Iran would take a responsible attitude commensurate with its international obligations and State practice. Accordingly, Iraq approached the United Nations SecretaryGeneral and requested him to send a special representative to see the provocative character of the Iranian military and other measures, and to assess directly the unfounded nature of Iranian allegations of a similar Iraqi military buildup on our side. But Iran, which had the opportunity to prove its respect for the office of the SecretaryGeneral and the role of the United Nations in preserving international peace and security, rejected our offer on various pretexts.
154.	The Middle East suffers from more than its share of the consequences of provocation and aggression. It is incumbent upon neighboring Iran to realize that territorial aggrandizement, by means of threats to use force or by violating the rules of international law, is neither acceptable nor destined to meet with success.
155.	Once again I call upon neighboring Iran, as I did before, to adhere to the provisions of the permanent and valid Boundary Treaty, and to have recourse to the International Court of Justice in connexion with any dispute which may arise regarding the interpretation of its provisions. Such attitudes would restore good neighborly relations between our countries and enhance the opportunity for cooperation in the best interest of our two nations.
156.	The foreign policy of Iraq emanates from the progressive and humanitarian principles of the Baath Arab Socialist Party. Consequently, the liquidation of colonialism in all its forms, the support of the rights of peoples to liberation and national sovereignty and the elimination of all forms of racial prejudice and discrimination are firm directives in the foreign policy of the Iraqi Republic.
157.	The Arab Gulf area, which suffers from colonial presence and the domination of foreign monopolies, engages our special and continuous attention. In his statement during the celebrations of Iraq's national day last July, the President of the Republic outlined Iraq's policy towards that very important part of the Arab world, and emphasized the importance of its future for our national interests. President Ahmed Hassan AlBakr urged the prompt evacuation of all British forces in the area, and the liquidation of all imperialist bases. He also emphasized that Iraq absolutely rejects all allegations of a 'political vacuum' in the area as a pretext for continuing the imperialist presence or as a justification for foreign intervention and exploitation. Allegations of 'political vacuum' are but the Trojan horse of foreign imperialist interests, which has brought nothing but exploitation, restlessness and dangers to the people of the area. Securing peace and stability in the area, in the words of President AlBakr, is'' subject to the will of its Arab people in cooperation with brotherly Arab countries of the Gulf'. The Arab Gulf belongs to its rightful people and not to intruders and colonial settlers. Iraq rejects the substitution of one foreign presence in the Arab Gulf with another.
158.	Iraq reiterates its demands that the British forces be withdrawn and that all colonial bases, not only in the northern part of the Gulf but also in its southern part, including Oman and Muscat, be liquidated. Moreover, Iraq draws the attention of the United Kingdom Government to the negative and dangerous consequences which may result from any delay, hesitation and indecision regarding its withdrawal from the area. The indigenous Arab population of the Gulf demand its complete independence from the foreign imperialist presence and the domination of foreign monopolies, and rejects all allegations of interest or influence, from whatever source they emanate. Palace plots, such as those recently staged in Muscat and Oman in order to neutralize increasing popular discontent and thwart the revolution declared by the people of Oman for independence, progress, and the liquidation of foreign bases and monopolies, will never deceive the people of the Arab South.
159.	The struggle of the Arab nation for independence, freedom, and unity makes it a natural ally of all peoples struggling for freedom and progress. Our nation, which offers martyrs and sacrifices to confront the ZionistAmerican aggression, finds itself naturally allied and sympathetically bound to the people of VietNam in their just struggle against the United States military aggression and the stooges of Saigon. The sacrifice of the people of VietNam for independence and unity has gained them the admiration of all the peoples of the world and has become a source of inspiration to all peoples aspiring to freedom.
160.	The Republic of Iraq, which has extended complete diplomatic recognition to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South VietNam, supports fully the just struggle of the VietNamese people. We believe that the unconditional and complete withdrawal of all American forces from South VietNam, enabling the people of VietNam freely to exercise their right to self-determination, is the only guarantee of permanent peace in SouthEast Asia.
161.	American designs have not been confined to VietNam and the Middle East, where Israel carries them out on behalf of the United States, but have also extended to the peaceful people of Cambodia, which has preserved its unity, neutrality and independence under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk. But American intelligence, which has mastered the techniques of plotting in order to install its clients in power, engineered a coup d'etat against the legitimate Government as a preliminary step for the United States military intervention in Cambodia. The armed American aggression against Cambodia is another act that the United States has added to its miserable record of antagonizing nations and threatening their peace and security. The Government of the Republic of Iraq considers the Government of Prince Sihanouk as the sole legitimate Government of Cambodia, and calls upon all freedom loving Governments of the world to take a similar step as an expression of opposition to the policy of the United States and in support of the struggle of the Cambodian people.
162.	Despite the fact that ten years have passed since the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, many areas are still suffering from colonial domination and oppression. The people of Iraq strongly support the liberation movements in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) and the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe and Namibia.
163.	The Government of the Republic of Iraq calls upon the United Nations to exert all possible efforts in support of the struggle of peoples under the colonial yoke and the liberation movements. It also calls upon all Member States and the United Nations specialized agencies to implement the resolutions of the world Organization supporting the struggle against colonialism and racial discrimination.
164.	The celebration by the United Nations of its twenty-fifth anniversary particularly reveals the outrageous gap in the application of a most fundamental principle upon which the Organization is based, and that is the principle of universality. To deny the People's Republic of China its legitimate seat in the United N? ions, although it represents a quarter of the world's population, demonstrates positively one of the reasons for the failure of the Organization to promote international peace and security, which is a prime duty of the United Nations.
165.	American maneuvers, which are responsible for the creation of this abnormal situation, do a great disservice to the reputation of the international Organization and constitute an important factor in its failure to achieve its lofty aims.
166.	While referring to the United Nations reputation and prestige, it is worth remembering that the continuation of American occupation of South Korea under the United Nations flag greatly contributes to their decline. My Government feels that it is high time for the United Nations to rid itself of a situation that makes it an impediment to the aspirations of the Korean people to unity 'and independence, and which serves to cover up the illegal American occupation of South Korea.
167.	The importance of this session bestows a special importance upon the items on its agenda. Foremost among these items is the consideration of measures for strengthening international security. The Republic of Iraq, which shares with the international community a desire to strengthen international security, deems it necessary for the General Assembly to adopt a declaration relating to the strengthening of international peace and security on the basis of respect for the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law, emphasizing repudiation of the threat or use of force against the political independence and territorial integrity of the States of the world, placing due emphasis on respect for recognized boundaries between States, the nonintervention by States in the internal affairs of others, the inadmissibility of territorial expansion or occupation of the territory of a State through aggression and respect for the equal sovereign rights of States.
168.	The agenda of this session contains many important items, particularly those relating to disarmament and the reservation exclusively for peaceful uses of the seabed and the ocean floor outside the limits of national jurisdiction, and the exploitation of their resources for the benefit of mankind, and also the question of the breadth of the territorial sea and related subjects.
169.	The Iraqi delegation attaches considerable importance to the development of the principles of the Charter relating to friendly relations and cooperation among States.
170.	Since the Special Committee on friendly relations  has reached agreement on a number of important principles it is necessary for the General Assembly to adopt at this historical session a declaration on friendly relations among States.
171.	Among the important topics to be dealt with in the present session of the General Assembly is the launching of the Second Development Decade. Despite our great disappointment that the First Development Decade has failed to achieve its modest goals, there are hopeful signs that the Second Development Decade will achieve better results, the most important amongst which is the declared intention of the socialist countries to participate in the Second Development Decade. The delegation of Iraq welcomes this step, which will have far-reaching consequences on the future economic development of the developing countries. Moreover, although it is very important to plan a world strategy for the Second Development Decade, this alone will not be sufficient unless all States act in full cooperation and in a spirit of self-denial to achieve that strategy. The developed States are asked to render all assistance to developing countries, and particularly to transfer 1 per cent of their gross national product to the latter.
172.	In addition, the developing countries must realize that they bear prime responsibility for developing their national economy and increasing their production. Perhaps the most important aspect of this policy is that the developing countries should control their natural resources and exploit them nationally, as emphasized in numerous United Nations resolutions.
173.	Iraq realizes full well that it is its primary responsibility to develop its economy and raise the standard of living of its people. Thus it has embarked upon the exploitation of its natural resources through direct national means, in an effort to defend its legitimate national rights and interests vis-a-vis foreign monopolies. This is in addition to the strenuous efforts exerted to develop industry and agriculture. During the First Development Decade Iraq has achieved a rate of growth in gross national income which greatly exceeds the rate anticipated for developing countries.
174.	In addition, the national development plan for the years 19701974 has set a target for increasing the gross national income by a rate of 7.1 per cent annually. This equals twice the increase in population, and will, in turn, double the gross national income in ten years.
175.	In concluding my statement, I should like to point out that I have not embarked upon evaluating what the United Nations has done and achieved during the last quarter of a century, setting this aside for the commemorative session which is due to begin in a few days.
176.	I consider it important to affirm that Iraq, as one of the founders of the United Nations, has always been faithful to the letter and spirit of its Charter and dedicated to cooperation with all freedom  and peace loving nations in making the principles of the Charter the foundation stone of international relations, so that the hopes pinned by the peoples of the world upon our international Organization can be realized.


"
25,1970,BRA,"1.	Mr. President, I should like, first of all, to congratulate you on your unanimous election as President.of the twenty-fifth regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your excelled experience in international affairs, your proven competence in all matters pertaining to the theory and practice of the Organization, your outstanding contributions as professor, statesman and diplomat, and the fact that you are a national of a country which loves peace and is dedicated to the great causes of mankind are a pledge of the kind of action and leadership which will guide us in the debates that we are now starting. Allow me also to express our gratitude to Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph for the tact, impartiality and keen political sense with which she presided over our work during the twenty-fourth session.
2.	At the same time, it behooves me, on behalf of the Government I represent, to express to all representatives here assembled our gratification upon the election of Brazil to one of the Vice-Presidencies of the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth anniversary session. Brazil accepts this honor and this trust as a mandate for the active defense of the ideals, the rights and the aspirations which the Latin American nations share with other developing countries.
3.	If you will allow me now a remark of a personal nature, I should like to say that I am now reliving in spirit the experience of twenty-five years ago, when, in the early years of my diplomatic career, I was assigned as a Junior Adviser to the delegation of Brazil to the San Francisco Conference. Like many others in this hall, I had a small share in the creation of this Organization, and it would be less than human of me to fail to contrast the dreams and illusions of 1945 with the disturbing realities of the year 1970.
4.	I do not wish to begin my statement without a special, albeit brief, mention of three highly significant recent events in the domain of international relations.
5.	In the first place, I would cite the re-establishment of the cease-fire in the Middle East and the concurrent creation of better prospects for a peaceful solution to the crisis. The developments of the last few days are showing, however, how fragile and precarious is the present cease-fire regime, which will be meaningful and effective only if accepted as a first step towards the political settlement of the problem on the basis of resolution 242 (1967) of the Security Council and the purposes and principles of the Charter. Time and again Brazil has stressed in the organs of the United Nations the need for an open and frank debate on the fundamental causes of the conflict. For historical reasons, very special responsibilities devolve upon the United Nations in connexion with the question of the Middle East. It is imperative, therefore, that the Organization, with the support of all its members, fulfill the obligations it has assumed.
6.	Secondly, we have the conclusion of the German- Soviet treaty of 12 August 1970, an important milestone in the history of international relations and a concrete step towards at long last breaking the bonds which hold us to 1945, thus superseding the post-war concept. It cannot be denied that the significance of this agreement transcends the scope of bilateral relations involving the two signatories. It affects European politics as a whole, and even the over-all pattern of international relations. Its impact upon the United Nations is equally significant; it would not be far-fetched to point out that it is tantamount to a suppression of Articles 53 and 107 of the Charter. Here is additional evidence that the world has not stood still during the last twenty- five years, and that the structure of international life does not cease to evolve.
A/PV.1841
7.	Finally, I could not fail to mention the convening of the first special session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States, putting into effect the changes in the structure of the OAS provided for in the Buenos Aires Protocol of 1967. In bringing the machinery for co-operation up to date, the nations of the western hemisphere reaffirm their decision to broaden the scope of their common endeavors for development and justice. They take this positive stand at a time when very small minority groups, in obedience to an outside guidance which they blindly follow, try in vain to use the weapons of terrorism to undermine the progress of their own peoples. Insane acts such as the hijacking of aircraft, armed assaults and robberies, the seizure and holding of innocent hostages, 
particularly diplomatic representatives, dastardly, brutal assassinations these are crimes at which world public opinion recoils, vehemently condemning the perpetrators. The Organization of American States has classified these as common crimes, and even as crimes against humanity. Echoing this line of thought, at the first special session of its General Assembly, the Organization of American States reaffirmed its emphatic repugnance for such methods of violence and terror.
8.	Brazil is particularly sensitive to this situation. For over a month and a half, we have been suffering the agonizing drama of having a member of our diplomatic corps held by despicable kidnappers, the defenseless victim of heinous brutality.
9.	Moreover, the serious incidents of the last few days are demonstrating that the problem of aircraft hijacking and the imprisonment of hostages demands clear and effective measures on the part of this Organization, as an instrument of the collective will of the community of nations.
10.	By instinct man attempts to evade eternity, and in doing so resorts to artificial divisions and demarcations of time, to the expedients of clepsydras, clocks and calendars. Man himself continues to be the measure of all things, and he feels the need to impose upon the measuring rod of his existence certain marks and points of reference, way stations, stop-overs, from which he can look back at the road he has already traveled and prepare himself for the rest of the journey. In this moment for pause and reflection it is important not to allow ourselves to be lulled into the unrealistic attitude of imagining the past and remembering the future.
11.	The Assembly of the twenty-fifth anniversary is indeed one of these way stations at which we can stop for a brief moment before proceeding along the road which will hopefully lead us to peace, justice and progress.
12.	This year we are also commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The adoption of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) was one of the most important decisions ever taken by this Organization. It embodies the formal reaffirmation of the inalienable right of all peoples to self- determination. My country here and now reiterates its full support for this principle, just as it cannot fail to reiterate its concern over the persistence of policies of apartheid and racial discrimination, objects of the most formal repudiation and strongest condemnation by the Government and people of Brazil.
13.	Peace is no longer a simple ideal, a dream or a Utopian scheme. It has become the most pressing, the most elementary, of all needs. It has ceased to be an objective and has become a premise. Either we have a peaceful future before us or we run the risk of having no future at all. It is no longer a matter of evoking ideals of self-denial and altruism. It is no longer a matter of emphasizing the necessity for moral and political advances to match the prodigious scientific and technological progress of our day. It is a matter of appealing to the fundamental interest of man, to his instinct for self-preservation, for what is really at stake is the survival of man.
14.	No institution is more important than the men who set it up or the purpose it was designed to serve, and no political institutions are to be more revered than the people whose interest they are intended to protect. For that very reason, as far as the United Nations is concerned, we should first of all ask ourselves if our world Organization measures up to the ideals and desires vested in its creation at San Francisco and, then, what we can do today to improve it in the light of the experience we have acquired during the last twenty-five years.
15.	As for our first question, there is no doubt that the United Nations has not played the full role it was intended for in a world of crises, open conflicts, war communiques, shocks and counter-shocks. Without solving and at times without even discussing in depth the problems of peace, collective security and economic development, the United Nations has managed to give the impression that we have found it possible to content ourselves with the so-called new tasks  matters of science and technology, the preservation of the environment, population growth and others. Of course no one underestimates the importance of all these problems and, in some cases, the need for their adequate treatment through effective international cooperation with all due deference to the principles of the Charter which guarantee the national sovereignty and juridical equality of Member States. It is obvious that we have no objection to dealing with these matters in this forum, although it might seem more logical and practical to turn them over to the specialized agencies, ratione materiae. However, we must be careful to avoid turning the scale of priorities upside down. We cannot afford to reduce this Organization to the meager proportions of an international institute of technology. We must not forget that the United Nations represents the only specialized agency we have for peace, development and collective security. Should the Organization fail to carry out the fundamental tasks entrusted to it by the Charter it would be so debilitated that it would not even be able to cope with the ancillary assignments.
16.	One has the impression that there has been a retreat from the ideals and principles of San Francisco. If this were allowed to happen world peace would shrink to a mere process of detente or relaxation of tensions; the concept of general and complete disarmament, which strictly speaking should be inscribed among the purposes and principles of the Charter, would be superseded by the concept of 'limitation of armaments' or 'arms control'; the concept of collective security would dissolve into mere 'security assurances' more limited in scope than those already provided for in the Charter. In the process dubious concepts would gain ground: 'political realism', 'spheres of influence', 'balances of power' and above all the uncouth doctrine of 'limited sovereignty', which stands for the very negation of international law and the freedom of nations.
17.	An attempt is being made to present the objective of general and complete disarmament as chimerical or Utopian while in reality it is no more Utopian or chimerical than the purposes and principles of the Charter which preclude the use of force in international relations. To relegate disarmament to the roll of unattainable objectives would be tantamount to denying as a premise the validity of the principles of the Charter in the world of today. In this context abandoning disarmament as the end objective of our efforts would be equivalent to rejecting the norm of peaceful settlement for international litigation. If force cannot be used, why do States persist in accumulating arms?
18.	It is up to us to forgo any tendency to consider some of the purposes and principles of the Charter as outmoded or bypassed by events. Supranationalism and interdependence may well constitute desirable goals, but they presuppose a stage, still to be reached, of political and economic independence and of effective juridical equality of all nations. Before declaring that the purposes and principles listed in Article 2 of the Charter are obsolete or outmoded, we should make a common effort to implement and observe them. Legitimate and lasting interdependence can only be attained through full sovereignty and equality.
19.	It is often said that although the United Nations has had little success in the specific field of peace and international security, it should not be forgotten that significant results have been achieved in the area of economic and social development. Unhappily, we are not in a position to share this optimistic view. The First United Nations Development Decade presented an unmistakable balance-sheet of failures and the Second Development Decade may well follow in its footsteps if we do not succeed in defining the strategy for it in stronger, more definite terms. In the final analysis, it must be determined whether or not the nations that make up the Organization are ready to accept, both in theory and in practice, a concept of collective security in the economic field, paralleling those for peace and security among nations.
20.	The failure of the First Development Decade lies as much in the field of planning and co-ordination as in the field of implementation and, above all, in the political field. The measures adopted were inadequate when compared to the needs of the developing countries. But beyond that, in the crucial moments of taking decisions, as for example during the second session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,  the conceptual framework of the United Nations system suffered from the lack of a global theory of development and, primarily, from the absence of the indispensable political will.
21.	Now, as we approach the end of the task of elaborating the strategy for the Second Development Decade, the United Nations has before it a clear new option that will determine the future of the system of international economic co-operation for development. It must choose between a strategy of stability, designed only to maintain the induces of poverty at their present levels, or a dynamic strategy for development.
22.	The strategy of stability, though for obvious reasons never couched in explicit terms, seems to contain three main elements: a demographic policy that fails to take into account the dynamic implications of the process of population growth; an agricultural policy directed towards a quantitative increase in the production of foodstuffs, as an end in itself and not as part of a global policy of industrialization for development; and, finally, an employment policy which, if necessary, is ready to sacrifice the greater objective of development to the attainment of sectorial employment goals.
23.	The dynamic strategy, on the other hand, is designed to go beyond a mere freezing of the present international economic imbalance. This has always been the guiding principle followed by Brazil in all the bodies in which there was any discussion of the prospects for the Second Development Decade: the strategy for the seventies should be, in our view, a program for action with converging and additional measures. Essentially, it should consist of three elements: firstly, global and sectoral objectives that, by the end of the Decade, will make it possible for the developing countries to increase their gross national products so significantly as to narrow the income gap between the north and the south; in the second place, a combination of measures mutually agreed upon in the fields of trade, financing and technology; and, finally, target dates for the implementation of these measures, of which the most important is the goal of 1 per cent of financial transfers.
24.	It should be emphasized that the amount of information and research already available within the United Nations system makes it perfectly feasible to adopt such a dynamic strategy, if -and this is the main point the Governments of the developed countries, both those with a market economy and the centrally planned ones, gird themselves with the indispensable political will to accept their commitments and to see that they are carried out. The alternative would be a sad realization that the scheme of international cooperation for development can only result in failure, a failure that it is impossible to cover up with half-way measures and declarations of good intentions.
25.	Such a failure would not imply that economic and social development would become unattainable, though, for many, the road would certainly be rendered more painful and more difficult. We all know that some Member States achieved notable growth indexes by internally mobilizing their own resources may I be allowed to say that my own country, Brazil, for instance, in 1969 had a 9 per cent increase in its gross national product. I do, however, have some doubt as to the possibility of developing countries as a whole finding viable formula for economic and social progress if we have a continuation of present tendencies towards stagnation in the flow of trade and of economic co-operation. We are not pleading for a solution to our national model. We are fully aware that the development of Brazil is our own responsibility, and we do not shrink from it. What we are attempting to do is to pose the problem on a world-wide basis.
26.	Brazil has repeatedly declared itself in favor of a revision of the Charter of the United Nations so as to adapt it to present-day conditions and relate it to the problems of the contemporary world. We do, however, recognize the political realities and difficulties standing in the way of an immediate revision. We see the revision as an essential step forward. But there is a danger that the prevailing conditions in the world, where power is used every day political power, economic power, military power, scientific and technological power may force us a step backwards, and a new Charter under these conditions may take the form of just one more element for freezing world power, as one of the factors for the maintenance of the status quo. Anyhow, it would be impossible to undertake a sober stock-taking of the achievements and short-comings of the Organization in these last twenty-five years without a full and thorough analysis of the international instrument which gives life to and governs the working of our Organization.
27.	That is why the problem of the revision of the Charter should be posed, and that is why we consider it highly significant that the General Committee should have decided yesterday to recommend the inclusion on our agenda of item 88 relating to the 'Need to consider suggestions regarding the review of the Charter of the United Nations'.
28.	As of now it is imperative to bring back to the forum of the United Nations certain problems which clearly fall within its competence and are now being discussed behind closed doors in dwindling circles. As a concession to the realities of power, the United Nations Charter conferred special prerogatives upon the permanent members of the Security Council. The permanence of their powers in the field of peace and international security is already in itself one of these prerogatives. But the Security Council as an institution cannot abdicate from its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security by acknowledging a new world order based upon a co- chairmanship in the hands of a very reduced number of Powers, in direct opposition to the spirit of the Charter. Powerless before the conflicts and dissensions that threaten and disrupt world peace, the Security Council seems little by little to be taking on the shape of a public registry office for the filing of complaints and counter-complaints, claims and counter-claims. It is well known that the methods of work of the Council have changed substantially during recent years with the result that now decisions are reached after a series of informal consultations rather than in open debates at formal meetings of the collective organ. Despite this development, which has been accompanied by a trend towards unanimity, the Council has been unable to ensure the enforcement of its decisions. This is largely due to the fact that the consultations carried on by the members of the Council are, as a rule, directed at collateral aspects of the problems and not towards the search for a political solution capable of eliminating the causes of the conflicts. Moreover, it so happens that consensus and unanimity are almost always reached at the expense of the relevancy of the texts adopted, language so vague and ambiguous being employed that the decisions are open to varied interpretations by the Council members. We are thus threatened with the emergence of a 'veto by interpretation'.
29.	In a memorandum dated 3 April 1970[see AI7922], in reply to a consultation by the Secretary-General of the United Nations under the terms of resolution 2606 (XXIV), the Brazilian Government took the opportunity to declare that any effort to reactivate the security system of the United Nations should lead the Security Council to a substantive examination of the differences underlying every specific situation that presents a threat to peace and security. The substantive consideration and study of the questions would be greatly facilitated by the active participation of the litigants in the informal process of consultations which is now prevalent. For that very reason and with the objective of institutionalizing these consultations, the Brazilian Government advanced the suggestion which I now reiterate that the Council, utilizing the faculties with which it is endowed by Chapter VI of the Charter, should in each case consider the advisability of the establishment of ad hoc committees for the pacific settlement of disputes, such committees to be made up of the parties to a conflict together with other delegations chosen by the Council at the suggestion of the litigants. These committees would have the broadest and most flexible mandates and would function, unhampered by records or a predetermined agenda, under the authority of the Security Council with the objective of harmonizing and reconciling the positions of the parties to the dispute.
30.	All of us are aware of the difficulties that arise whenever, once the means provided for in Chapter VI have been exhausted, an attempt is made to choose among the range of coercive measures set forth in Chapter VII. This is only natural considering that we can almost always count on a lack of unanimity among the permanent members and that if coercive measures were to be applied certain consequences would arise. What we should ask ourselves in a good number of cases is if the potentialities of Chapter VI have really been explored to the fullest. It is our earnest conviction that the United Nations and, more specifically, the Security Council should make greater use of the large variety of means and resources authorized by Chapter VI of the Charter.
31.	In short, what Brazil proposes now is a diplomatic reactivation of the United Nations. The adoption of procedures similar to the one suggested would afford the Organization much greater efficiency and authority as well as a more active role in the major problems of the world.
32.	Why should this suggestion strike anyone as unrealistic or impractical, and why should the eternal argument of 'political realism' be leveled against it?
33.	Let us not forget that this so-called political real-ism has pushed us to the brink of war and destruction and is the chief cause for the $200,000 million spent every year in the arms race. Apart from possible catastrophic consequences, the arms race has already done irreparable damage to mankind by draining off enormous means and resources which could have been used to further peace, justice and progress.
34.	Our problems and difficulties are not outside the reach of human intelligence and its creative power. With all its short-comings and frustrations the United Nations is the only forum in which we can still opt for life, peace and development.
35.	At this stage, my country does no more than advance the most modest and the least original of proposals: let us use our Organization and let us apply the Charter; no more, no less. The acceptance of this proposal, which is a commonplace in the statements delivered in the general debate of every Assembly, could none the less have a dramatic impact upon the shape of our future.
36.	Brazil will never forsake this great hope: the hope for peace, justice and progress.

"
25,1970,AUS,"100.	  It is a pleasure for me to extend to you, Mr. President, the warmest congratulations of the Australia Government and its delegation to this General Assembly on your election to the Presidency. The distinguished part you have played in the service of your country and in the development of this Organization, notably through your authoritative study of the Charter, makes you a fitting and admirable choice to preside over this session.
101.	In congratulating you I also want to express through you the thanks and appreciation of the Australian delegation for the efficient and dedicated manner in which your predecessor, Mrs. Angie Brooks Randolph of Liberia, discharged her responsibilities as President of the twenty-fourth session.
102.	As so many of my colleagues have said, this twenty-fifth anniversary session is an appropriate occasion to examine the workings of our Organization its successes and failures, its merits and shortcomings.
103.	looking back to 1945 we should keep in mind the a;',' nations of the founder Members of the United Nations in San Francisco and the problems they had to solve.
104.	Today, under the compulsion of circumstances and events, we must ask ourselves *o what extent the United Nations has succeeded. I 2 paramount and immediate importance, we must ask whether we can make any contribution to improving its performance. This, I emphasize, is the greatest test of statesmanship and sincerity of our times.
105.	Let us recall the conditions that existed when the Charter was signed. It was an unhappy and disturbed world in which the most destructive war of all times was still being fought; a war in which my country and many others, large and small, were still heavily involved; a war wnidi had directly or indirectly dominated people's daily lives everywhere throughout six years of struggle against violent and tyrannical oppression. It was a more disturbed world than that which had given birth a generation earlier to the League of Nations. It was a world in which there was a passionate yearning for peace and order, for a system of rules for the orderly conduct of relations between nations, for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for the improvement of the quality of life for all mankind.
106.	In this mood of hope and determination our Governments met in San Francisco. There was never much disagreement about the name to be given to the new Organization; the worldwide alliance of Powers, then within sight of final victory , had already become known as the United Nations.
107.	The forging of its Charter, on the other hand, was necessarily a more difficult process. After the traumatic experience of the Second World War the nations united in war were ready enough to recognize the need for a more broadly based and more effective institution than the League of Nations, a new institution which would have to accommodate the aspirations and interests of more than fifty nations. The major Powers had differences to reconcile amongst themselves and the rights of the smaller nations were vigorously pressed, not least of all by the Australian delegation. Thus the Charter that emerged was inevitably the product of compromise, implicit as well as explicit. This should be recognized in any evaluation of the past.
108.	The Charter was founded on the proposition that the major allied Powers, those which carried the heaviest burden of the war, would share the main responsibility for preserving the peace. If this concept was to be successful it had to be postulated on the continued existence among the major allies of the same unity of purpose that had carried them to the point of victory and on a common interest in maintaining world peace in 'he future. It was with that expectation, indeed on t! edition, that the major allies were given a special position under the Charter, with rights and obligations exceeding those of all other Members.
109.	Even before the Charter was signed, suspicion and discord had arisen amongst them. Succeeding years have seen an intensified conflict of ideologies and worldwide clashes of national interests. At times it even seemed that the objective was conflict and turmoil and not peace and security, and the promotion, rather than the suppression, of armed conflict in areas of competitive interest. Those differences of outlook, interests and ideology among the permanent members of the Security Council have prevented the Council from performing the role intended for it by the Charter.
110.	We cm speculate about what might have happened if the Military Staff Committee, so hopefully envisaged under Chapter VII of the Charter, had been allowed to take shape and to assume the functions planned for it.
111.	We might also deplore our failure to settle the question of how the costs of peacekeeping operations are to be shared equitably.
112.	Having said that, we should acknowledge that we have been spared the horrors of a third world war. Undoubtedly, the basic explanation up to the present has been the rapid development of weapon technology. Another world war has been too horrible for any nation to contemplate. No one could win. The world as a whole would be certain to suffer disastrous consequences.
113.	The United Nations may perhaps claim some small credit for providing a safety valve for public debate and a forum in which the great Powers have been forced to explain and justify their attitudes and actions. In its twenty-five years the United Nations has not been able to prevent a number of limited wars of the conventional type; nor has it found the answer to insidious threats to national integrity and security through the newly developed techniques of infiltration, subversion and insurgency.
114.	The peacekeeping record has not, however, been wholly bleak. Korea is an illustration, even without agreement among the major Powers. In the Middle East, Kashmir, the Congo and Cyprus, United Nations forces and truce supervisory teams have in the past played a significant role in critical situations which could have grown considerably worse without their presence.
115.	Despite strains, divisions and its limited record of achievement in its primary role, th^ United Nations has survived for twenty-five years. That indicates that many Members recognize that there is a residual or net value in the Organization and that they still hope for a future in which it will perform functions which measure up to their expectations.
116.	As we look to the future, it is surely no exaggeration to say that the reputation of the United Nations and the degree of respect it enjoys among people everywhere will hinge on its performance in helping to settle disputes among nations and in keeping the peace.
117.	Undoubtedly, there is room for improvement in the peacekeeping procedures of the Organization and the machinery provided for the settlement of disputes. But practical success in this peacekeeping role must depend ultimately on subjective factors the attitudes, intentions and honesty of purpose of the great Powers and of the individual nations concerned in particular disputes.
118.	Australia has consistently supported the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations with both men and money. As early as 1947 we were one of the three members of one of the first mediation and peacekeeping missions set up by the United Nations  the United Nations Commission for Indonesia. We contributed substantial forces to the United Nations action in Korea.
119.	At the present time we are making a significant contribution to peace observation and supervision in Kashmir, the Middle East and Cyprus. We will continue, as a member of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, to support efforts to formulate procedures designed to increase the effectiveness of future operations and to ensure that they are properly financed. We will continue to maintain our firm belief in the United Nations Charter and are convinced that in the faithful and devoted support of its principles lies the best hope for the future peace and progress of mankind.
120.	From peacekeeping and the peaceful settlement of disputes, let me turn to the painful and difficult problem of arms control and the reduction of armaments. The constant and frightening improvement in military technology and the complexity of the problems involved in effecting balanced armament reductions make the subject of disarmament a difficult one for most to understand. This difficulty of understanding is. no excuse for thinking it is an academic exercise divorced from the realities of daily living.
121.	All of us know that the continuing discussions and negotiations on the control and reduction of armaments, protracted, complex and technical as they are, can vitally affect the security of all countries. Security may be indivisible, but dangers to security vary in nature and degree from region to region and from country to country.
122.	The advent of the nuclear balance of terror and the knowledge of other equally horrifying weapons of mass destruction have brought home to us forcibly how vulnerable we are to the whims of scientific progress in the notoriously accident-prone hands of mankind. Surely it is right that our efforts to control armaments should concentrate in the first instance on limiting and controlling weapons of mass destruction.
123.	That said, it should be added that a worldwide balance of force, if it is to be effective in containing aggression and preserving security, must include the balance of conventional as well as nuclear armaments. It is with conventional weapons that the many acts of aggression have been committed in the years since the Charter came into force, and we must unhappily expect that there will be more. To pay less attention to the threat that is familiar and traditional than to the threat that is almost unimaginable but controllable is contrary to our mutual interests and welfare.
124.	I believe we can be a little encouraged by the progress that has been made in arms control and disarmament. First, Australia has signed the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] subject to certain understandings and interpretations. We hope it will in time become a fully effective barrier against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Secondly, indications of progress in the strategic arms limitation talks between the United States and the Soviet Union also offer some hope. Thirdly, the prospect of agreement to prevent the placing of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed is also welcome. The Australian Government hopes that the text of the draft treaty now before the Assembly  will gain widespread support. Fourthly, there are also grounds for hope that, as a result of discussion at the conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva this year, we may be at or near the threshold of substantive progress towards supplementing and strengthening the prohibitions on chemical and biological weapons of war that already exist in the Geneva Protocol of 1925.
125.	I have spoken at length about the influences that affect the balance between peace and war because the paramount purpose of the United Nations must still be to preserve peace and outlaw war and because this paramount purpose has not always been well served.
126.	Let me turn now to another purpose of the Charter which can be measured by the increase in membership of the United Nations in twenty-five years. I refer to the progress from dependent status to full sovereignty and statehood of more than half of the present Members of the Organization.
127.	The circumstances in which those sections of the Charter relating to dependent Territories came to be drafted in San Francisco are worth remembering. The Covenant of the League of Nations broke new ground. It introduced and put into effect in the Mandate system the novel concept that the international community held a degree of responsibility for the guidance of colonial peoples towards self-government and independence. By 1945 that concept had been strengthened and developed by the experiences of the Second World War. self-determination for dependent Territories became the accepted goal, and was given wider and more precise expression in Chapters XI, XII and XIII of the Charter.
128.	I note here that the Australian delegation at San Francisco took a particularly active part in the drafting of those Chapters, especially those sections dealing with the rights of the peoples of dependent Territories and the obligations of the administering Powers and of the United Nations towards them.
129.	Since that time there have been profound and rapid changes, which are continuing. The Charter set the targets and the standards. It only remained for the metropolitan Powers to accept responsibility for the changes that inevitably had to be made. In most cases they were accepted willingly and generously.
130.	There was also a complementary responsibility for the dependent peoples themselves first to understand their opportunities and responsibilities and then work towards achieving them. In some cases freedom and national sovereignty came only after a lengthy and sometimes bitter struggle; in most cases they came more happily as a result of a rational acceptance of the situation by both sides and a peaceful and mutually satisfactory transfer of political power.
131.	In this process of the development of dependent peoples to nationhood the United Nations, reflecting the liberal and humanitarian instincts of mankind, and sometimes its impatience, has played a significant part.
132.	To be specific, I want to speak briefly about one dependent area of great concern to Australia, in which this process of developing is taking place rapidly. This is the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.
133.	Let me describe the position there. It is the largest of the remaining dependent Territories outside the continent of Africa; it lies immediately to the north of Australia; its area is approximately 180,000 square miles, and its population totals two and a quarter million. It is a larger unit than many Members of the United Nations. Because of its exceptionally rugged terrain and the successive waves of migration that occurred over the centuries, these two and a quarter million people are divided amongst themselves by ethnic and tribal differences and also by something like 700 different languages not different dialects, but different languages. It is this fragmented society that is now drawing together into an identifiable nation.
134.	My delegation reports each year to this Assembly about the progress made and the difficulties encountered during the preceding twelve months. The proclaimed policy is to ensure the exercise by the people of the Territory of their inalienable right to self determination. We are now doing, and will continue to do, all we can to prepare the people of the Territory for the termination of dependent status and their accession to full self-government and independence.
135.	Next year another United Nations Visiting Mission, the seventh, will go to the Territory and will be able to see for itself the striking progress that has been made since the visit of the last Mission in 1968.
136.	Earlier this year I had the honor to lead the Australian delegation to the meeting of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, which recommended that the Territory of Papua and New Guinea be admitted as one of its associate members, a recommendation which has since been unanimously approved by the Economic and Social Council at its forty-ninth session [resolution 1523 (XLIX)].
137.	The Australian Government thinks that this approval and other activities, such as participation in the South Pacific Conference, are recognition of the growing national identity of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and further steps along the road towards self-determination.
138.	I should like now to range northward and westward from New Guinea into Asia. Let me say that I presume to speak about the general situation throughout Asia because of the great importance to this Organization of events there and their particular importance to Australia.
139.	In our view, to judge from the agenda of this twenty-fifth session, Asia receives less attention than it is entitled to from the General Assembly. I would like to think that this was a good sign; that a peaceful and well-ordered Asia offered few serious problems to the international community. Up to a point this may be true. In the view of my Government it is fair to say that apart from the few serious and easily identifiable major problems, there is evidence throughout eastern, southeastern and southern Asia of a measure of stability, vitality and economic progress that we would not have dared to hope for twenty- years ago.
140.	Of these major problems China is critical. We shall again be considering the question of the representation of China in the United Nations. Australia, situated at the edge of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to SouthEast Asia, is more concerned with its longterm relations with mainland China than most Members of this Organization. We see plenty of evidence to our north of how much the enormous size, power, and influence of mainland China intrude into and affect the interests and the calculations of smaller nations. My predecessors in office, when speaking to the Assembly, have emphasized that the problem of China's relations with its immediate neighbors and with the rest of the world outside Asia is much greater and more complex than the question of Communist China's admission to this Assembly.
141.	We see as clearly as anyone the need for an accommodation with the Peking regime, and we are as anxious as anyone that an accommodation be achieved. But we constantly run up against the mirror image, in its conduct of its external relations, of the ruthlessness and harshness which have been a feature of the present regime's treatment of its own people. Above all, we are conscious of the need for a settlement of the future of the people of Taiwan that takes full account of the wishes of 14 million people, more than the population of Australia and oft the majority of Member countries of the United Nations. The interests and welfare of 14 million people are not to be treated as an incidental consideration in some package deal. The Assembly has a grave responsibility to ensure that the status and the rights of these people are protected and guaranteed.
142.	It is sometimes claimed that the admission of Communist China to the United Nations will act as a catalyst in opening the way to better relations between China and that part of the international community from which Peking seems to have chosen to isolate itself. We do not at present share this optimistic view. On the other hand, we suppose that the adoption by Communist China of a more reasonable attitude towards international society as a whole, and towards the purposes and principles of the Charter, would facilitate its entry into this Organization.
143.	I turn next to the gravest problem now facing us in Asia. It is an unhappy reflection of the failure of the United Nations in its primary role of keeper of the peace that the VietNam situation has never been properly debated here, let alone considered as to possible action. Everywhere else, of course, the VietNam war has been for five years and more one of the great divisive issues of our time. It is understandable that the world's conscience should have revolted against the fearful losses and hardships that the people of VietNam have suffered almost without interruption since well before the United Nations came into being. It is less understandable, in the view of the Australian Government, that the people of South VietNam who are manifestly the victims of aggression in its most naked and ruthless form and the elected Government of South VietNam which has demonstrated beyond doubt that it reflects the wishes of the great majority of the people should have had to undergo so much biased and totally unfair criticism.
144.	The outrages they have been compelled to endure from their internal and external aggressors, acting in complete defiance of the Geneva Agreements of 1954, need to be precisely stated. Intimidation, kidnapping, extortion and assassinations have the same meaning in anyone's language, whatever devices are employed to present them under the guise of 'liberation'.
145.	The day may come we all hope it will when the people of North and South VietNam can be reunited. In the meantime there is a well-marked boundary between the north and the south. Both halves of VietNam could begin to achieve the economic stability and wellbeing of some of their neighbors if only the regime in Hanoi could be persuaded to give up its hopeless struggle and withdraw behind the demilitarized zone.
146.	The spillover of the VietNam conflict into neighboring Laos and Cambodia is well enough known to this Assembly, at least in general terms. The representatives of those countries will, I am sure, describe it in detail.
147.	Australia has been active throughout the past decade in helping the Government of Laos to maintain a stable economy and thereby to resist the familiar pressures and encroachments of an alien and unwanted ideology.
148.	More recently the same kinds of pressure have been brought to bear on Cambodia. There the North VietNamese aggression was a blatant violation of the country's neutrality and independence. In May of this year the Australian Government took part in a regional conference of Foreign Ministers held in Djakarta to consider this enlarged threat.
149.	That meeting of Foreign Ministers was a constructive initiative by the Asian countries most directly concerned to try to ensure respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and neutrality of Cambodia. The collective view of that meeting was subsequently communicated accurately and forcefully to the Secretary General, to the Governments of the major Powers and in a number of other capitals by three selected envoys from the group.
150.	I sincerely hope that the General Assembly will recognize this as a valuable regional initiative that is not only provided for but encouraged under Chapter VIII of the Charter.
151.	A great deal has been said, and more is bound to be said in the course of this Assembly, about the situation in the Middle East. Emotions are running high as a result of difficulties that have impeded the United States effort to restart peace talks and because of the recent series of criminal acts against civil aircraft and their passengers. The present situation is extremely delicate. In these circumstances I do not believe that any more detailed comments by me at this stage would be helpful.
152.	Let me turn to one other topic. In the last twenty- five years the world has seen tremendous progress in the physical sciences and in industrial technology. These advances in science and technology will bring great benefits to mankind. They can also produce major side effects, often of a harmful kind,
153.	An international organization like this, concerned with the maintenance of peace and security and the promotion of international economic cooperation and the raising of living standards, must concern itself continuously with these developments. In our view, the United Nations has a significant and urgent responsibility to assist in the application of science and technology to national development in the most constructive and beneficial way. Conversely, we must do all in our power to minimize the harmful effects of technological change.
154.	The United Nations has a related responsibility, equally important, to devise an acceptable framework of international law in which the development of science and technology can proceed in those spheres beyond the conventional limits of national jurisdiction. At present the pace of such development is threatening to outstrip the capacity of international lawyers to devise such a framework.
155.	It is a matter of regret that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has not been able to negotiate a convention on liability for damage caused by space objects. Australia, with most other countries, has argued strongly in favor of a convention that would provide certain, prompt and equitable compensation for the victims of space damage. This remains an area in which technology is moving dangerously far ahead of the law.
156.	Advances in science and technology have also created a need for international legal action in regard to the seas and the seabed. The problems involved are urgent, comprising both the review of old concepts and the development of new ones. The substantive decisions that must be made will be important for
Governments and their peoples and for the international community at large.
157.	Those who are responsible for taking these decisions must bear in,mind that the system or systems they devise will have to deal equitably with differing and often competing national and international interests if they are to gain widespread acceptance. The alternative to coherent multilateral action with respect to the problems of the seas and the seabed could well be an unmanageable situation.
158.	Of all the consequences of the introduction and intensive application of new developments to science and technology none has given rise to wider concern than their effects upon the human environment. Our natural surroundings are being increasingly recognized as an irreplaceable part of our heritage. The problems of pollution have arisen in their starkest form in the highly industrialized countries, and it is to be hoped that those countries where pollution of the environment has not yet reached the same crisis point will be able to profit from the lessons learned elsewhere.
159.	Australia's own situation, where the noxious byproducts of industrial development are as much a subject for debate and action as the need to develop our natural resources, puts us in a particularly good position to share with all regions of the world the fruits of cur experience in coping with man's environment. As a basis on which a contribution can be made to help solve this problem the Australian Senate recently appointed a Select Committee to report on water pollution. The report has been completed and consideration is now being given to the most appropriate method of preventing further pollution.
160.	We do not need to be reminded that this year is not only the twenty-fifth anniversary of this Organization but also the first year of the Second United Nations Development Decade. We in Australia understand how fervently the developing countries want the Second Development Decade to succeed. It is in this spirit that our representatives have participated in the various United Nations and other forums which have been discussing the preparations for the Second Development Decade over the past two years, and particularly the aid programs.
161.	Three weeks ago I made an extensive review before the Australian Parliament of our policies of assistance for the developing countries. I reaffirmed our position at last week's ministerial meeting in Tokyo of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
162.	We have long thought that the only valid test of a country's approach to development assistance is its performance and its deeply felt desire to be helpful. We believe that Australia's record of performance compares well with that of others. Our aid to developing countries increased substantially during the 1960s, and I have recently been able to inform the Australian Parliament that it will again increase significantly in the first year of the Second Development Decade. 

163.	The budget for 19701971 provides for $US 200 million of official development assistance that is, assistance under the direction or control of Government. It does not include private capital flows, which are outside our jurisdiction and competence. Mostly, this assistance will be in the form of grants carrying no burden of interest or repayment. This will be an increase of 11 per cent over the previous financial year. Of this amount, $60 million is appropriated to Asian countries an increase of 14 per cent over the previous year.
164.	I have also recently announced important new plans regarding Australia's intentions to assist, in particular, Indonesia, Cambodia and South VietMam.
165.	There is one other aspect of our aid program that I want to mention. We want to ensure flexibility in any statement of aims for the Second Development Decade that may be adopted this year by the Assembly. The reasons are clear. Conditions in the various developing countries are different and require different treatment. Donor countries also face a variety of conditions, and these must influence the commitments they can make.
166.	In the view of my Government there has been a tendency, especially here at the United Nations, to concentrate on the gross amount of aid rather than the quantity of official aid and the quality and effectiveness of economic aid. Thus there has been too much preoccupation with percentage targets and dates for reaching them. I have reaffirmed Australia's support for an aid target for donor countries of 1 per cent of gross national product, as defined by resolution 27 (II) of the second session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,  which specifically acknowledges the position of capital importing countries like Australia. It is essential, however, not to let debate about the timing and level of targets distract attention from the overall need for donors to increase the amount of their total aid and particularly their official development assistance.
167.	I conclude by returning to the present condition of the United Nations and to the faults and merits most of us see in it. Like most large institutions, it threatens to become a prey to bureaucratization. There is a growing danger of rigidity in its proceedings; it threatens to be submerged under an accumulation of paper; committees and subcommittees continue to proliferate and duplication of effort seems to increase.
168.	It is a far cry from the day when the late David Owen set up the Secretariat with a desk, a chair and no telephone. Mere survival of the hectic pressures of the three months of a General Assembly session is an achievement in itself. There is a tendency to regard every United Nations resolution as an end in itself and not as a means to an end. In all this there is much room for improvement.
169.	It is not basically the Charter that is at fault, though we in Australia would be receptive to change in the Charter if it was thought necessary. We must look elsewhere. Our distinguished SecretaryGeneral, speaking in San Francisco on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the signing ceremony, called eloquently on all Member States to 'give the Charter a chance', to give it a go and let it succeed.
170.	The Foreign Minister of Brazil, in his thoughtful address which opened this debate [1841st meeting], reminded us that, with all its shortcomings and frustrations, the United Nations is the only forum in which we can still opt for life, peace and development. As he said, let us use the Organization and let us apply the Charter. We should take this advice to heart.
171. Finally, and above all, we must not lose hope in the United Nations. We must not let ourselves drift into cynicism. We should remember at all times the late Dag Hammarskjold's statement:
'It is not the Soviet Union nor indeed any ether big Powers who need the United Nations for their protection; it is ail the others. In this sense the Organization is first of all their Organization.'
"
25,1970,SOM,"107.	 It is with great pleasure that my delegation adds its voice to those of previous speakers in extending to Ambassador Hambro our sincere congratulations on his election to the high office of President of this particularly significant session of the General Assembly. His election is sufficient proof of those high qualifications which will enable him to guide our proceedings with wisdom and competence. We are confident that, under his guidance, the work of this session of the General Assembly will be brought to a successful conclusion.
108.	I also wish to extend my delegation's appreciation to his distinguished predecessor, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph, for the praiseworthy way in which she discharged her duties during her tenure of office. She has brought honor to her country, Liberia, and to Africa; indeed, Mrs. BrooksRandolph's performance as President of the General Assembly was also an honor to women all over the world.
109.	The opening of a new session of the General Assembly is always a time for taking stock of the achievements and failures of the United Nations. This traditional assessment is of course particularly appropriate as we begin the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly and approach the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. The failures of this Organization in its attempts to fulfill mankind's hope for peace are obvious enough, and the people of the Somali Democratic Republic share the disappointment felt by so many at the apparent inability of the United Nations to come to grips with the vital international problems of our time.
110.	The achie vements of the Organization, while not as spectacular as its failures, are none the less important; they are the kind of day-to-day achievements that are not featured in headlines, but they lay the groundwork for economic progress and for international goodwill. I am thinking particularly of the work of the specialized agencies in developing countries like my own where problems that affect the daily lives of our people are being tackled successfully with the help of the United Nations specialized agencies.
111.	However, progress in economic and social matters has little meaning unless there is peace in which to enjoy it. If the United Nations should become simply a development organization its failure in the political sphere would surely destroy its other achievements.
112.	Where does the cause for the failures of the United Nations lie? My delegation believes that it lies not in the Charter, but in the unwillingness of some Members to abide by the Articles of the Charter, by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and by United Nations resolutions when these seem to run counter to their interests. In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Charter we have a code of international morality and a system of international law which must be accepted as the basis of world civilization as it exists today, if we are to survive.
113.	Unfortunately, it has to be said that while we wait for general acceptance of the new international' morality based on the recognition of human rights, on the recognition of national aspirations towards independence and sovereignty, and on the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes while we wait for a change of heart, transgressions against human rights continue on a large scale; people who desire self-determination and independence are denied them and nations resort to violence and war, even when the machinery for the peaceful settlement of their disputes exists. The frustration of the wish for self determination and the denial of human rights lie at the heart of the dangerous situations which exist in VietNam, Cambodia, the Middle East, Korea and southern Africa. There must be a new attempt by Members of the United Nations to respond with sensitivity and honesty to the needs of the times.
114.	In our country we have also been faced with the need for a change of attitude. We also were in a situation where the insensitivity of the past Government to the needs of all the people was creating grave injustices, characterized by corruption, maladministration and lack of concern for the welfare of our people. The bloodless revolution which took place in Somalia last October represents a renewed effort at nation building and a revival of our national ideals which, despite the colonialists' vain attempts to destroy them, have been sustained with vigor and determination throughout our history.
115.	In keeping with our traditions and culture and in fulfillment of the aspirations of our people, we have chosen a system of democracy based primarily on African socialism. African socialism for us is not apolitical theory of relatively recent coinage; it is the traditional way of life of the Somali people. It is our hope and belief that the principle of justice for all, on which our popular democracy is based, is reflected in the positions taken by my Government on international problems confronting the world and the United Nations.
116.	In this regard I should like to say first of all that in its international relations the Somali Democratic Republic pursues a policy of positive nonalignment. This means that we have taken an independent stand on international issues according to their merits. It certainly does not mean a policy of non-involvement.
117.	Fulfillment of the obligations imposed upon all Member States by the Charter and by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights demands collective action by the Members of the United Nations in certain situations to bring about international Jaw and order and respect for human rights. The Somali people will cooperate to the fullest in such actions.
118.	President Kaunda of Zambia will be coming soon to the United Nations to present a series of proposals on the fundamental issues of our times. He will do that on behalf of those countries which participated in the Lusaka Conference of NonAligned States and on behalf of the Organization of African Unity. For that reason my delegation will not describe here the salient features of those proposals, which the Somali Democratic Republic wholeheartedly endorses. When the proposals are taken up individually in the various Committees of the General Assembly my delegation will take advantage of the opportunity to expound on and to speak in support of them. As the Conference of NonAligned States made clear, the nonaligned nations will exert moral pressure to the fullest extent in their attempt to bring about just solutions to the international situations that endanger peace.
119.	I intimated earlier the belief of my delegation that the frustration of the wish for self-determination and denial of human rights are factors common to all the dangerous situations that threaten international peace.
120.	There is a basic similarity between the problems of the Middle EafVietNam, Korea and the problems of southern Africa where the denial of human rights of the indigenous people is a philosophy of government and where, in the last strongholds of colonialism and imperialism, armed forces suppress the desire of the people for self-determination and independence. As the Government of an independent African nation and one which tries to pay more than lip service to the principles of the Charter, we are deeply concerned over the oppression of the people of southern Africa and the indifference of many members of the international community to that oppression.
121.	In South Africa we have the phenomenon of apartheid which Is the system of slavery in modern dress. The question of apartheid has been before this Assembly almost since its inception, and the development of the problem shows the typical syndrome of a United Nations failure, namely, a deterioration in the situation in direct proportion to the unwillingness of some Member States to act according to the consensus of the General Assembly or even according to the dictates of the Security Council. In the ten years since Sharpeville, and since the outburst of international indignation which followed that incident, the South African Government has increased the severity and the inhumanity of the application of its apartheid policy. It has been able to do so with impunity because of the material and moral support of South Africa's main trading partners.
122.	Without the cooperation of these nations, the economic and political isolation of South Africa called for by the General Assembly, and the total arms embargo called for and recently reaffirmed by the Security Council, have no chance of succeeding. In the past decade, as we all know, South Africa's main trading partners have increased their trade with and investments in South Africa. Some of them have either openly supplied it with armaments or used a completely unreal distinction between arms for internal oppression and arms for external defense in order to carry on this iniquitous trade.
123.	By their dealings with South Africa, its main trading partners have not only failed to give moral leadership but are helping to undermine the authority of the United Nations at a time when it is sorely needed to deal with the interrelated problems of southern Africa. South Africa continues to occupy Namibia and to extend apartheid to that Territory in defiance of the United Nations termination of its Mandate [resolution 2145 (XXI)] and in spite of the fact that the. United Nations has assumed responsibility for leading that Territory to independence. Its economic and military alliance with the rebel regime in Zimbabwe is in defiance of the economic sanctions imposed on that Territory by the Security Council [resolution 253 (1968)] and helps in the suppression of the liberation struggle of its oppressed people.
124.	Finally, South Africa's military and economic alliance with the Portuguese authorities helps in the suppression of the nationalist aspirations and the legitimate armed struggle of the people of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea (Bissau). These are all acts of defiance against the authority of the United Niations and they are clearly condoned and supported by those nations which have extensive economic and diplomatic relations with South Africa.
125.	As an African nation deeply concerned over the sufferings of our brothers in southern Africa, deeply concerned over the moral implications of the continued imposition of the racist philosophy of apartheid on millions of Africans, and deeply concerned over the threat to peace in Africa and beyond presented by the whole question of southern Africa. Somalia would like to see the Security Council resume its consideration of this question as a matter of urgency, for it has not been discussed by that body since 1964. No one pretends that sacrifices of varying degrees would not have to be made. But I suggest that such sacrifices would prove beneficial in the long run in terms of the goodwill and cooperation of the peoples of Africa and in terms of the possible prevention of a racial conflict with widespread implications.
126.	The role so far played in South Africa by countries such as France and the United Kingdom is inexcusable We would have thought that their centuries-old association with the peoples of Africa would have produced a greater sensitivity to African aspirations ar d prevented them from taking positions on the south ;m African questions which are contrary to the rights and interests of African peoples.
127.	But in the dark picture of the southern African scene there are some rays of hope. My Government, along with other African Governments, was particularly encouraged by the stand taken by Canada in opposition to the United Kingdom's decision to reopen the arms flow to South Africa. We received with satisfaction, too, the decision of Italy and Sweden to withdraw from participation in the construction of the CaboraBassa dam.
128.	We are grateful to the peoples and Governments of Scandinavia for the enlightened and forceful stand they have taken against the racist policies of South Africa and of their generous contributions in support of the common struggle against the evil policies of that Government.
129.	That great progress has been made since the founding of the United Nations towards ending colonialism and fostering the aspirations of peoples for self-determination and independence is evidenced by the number of new nations which have taken their places as Members of the United Nations. This is certainly one of the major achievements of the Organization. However, this progress must not make us complacent about the millions who are still denied the right to self-determination.
130.	I have already mentioned the oppressed people of the Portuguese held Territories whose liberation struggle, together with that of the peoples of South Africa, Namibia and Rhodesia, has ,been declared legitimate by the United Nations. These liberation movements are quite rightly in the forefront of international concern, forming as they do a part of the complex problem of southern Africa. My Government hopes, however, that the United Nations will continue to show concern for other Territories which are still to attain independence, such as French Somaliland, the Comoro Islands and Spanish Sahara.
131.	In this connexion we are pleased to note that an atmosphere of understanding exists between the French authorities and the people of French Somali land. The welfare and future of French Somaliland is of special concern to the Somali Democratic Republic.
132.	Apart from our desire as a Member of this Organization to support the principle of self determination, our concern for their welfare is a particular one arising from the strong ties of kinship and the common culture that bind the Somali people irrevocably to the people of French Somaliland. It is not the wish of my delegation to recount those unhappy circumstances which the people of French Somaliland experienced in the years 1966 and 1967, when they attempted to express their political aspirations. The lessons learn from those experiences have demonstrated that when the hopes and aspirations of a people are frustrated, violence is inevitably the consequence.
133.	The Government and people of the Somali Democratic Republic are anxious that peace be maintained in the Horn of Africa and they believe that with goodwill and a scrupulous regard for the principles enshrined in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, French Somaliland will be able to determine its destiny in a peaceful manner free from duress. Now that a better understanding prevails between the people of French Somaliland and the French authorities, we trust that France will demonstrate the same regard for political emancipation that it has shown to those other African nations which it formerly administered, and which today play such an important role in this Organization and in Africa.
134.	It is the duty not only of France but also of the United Nations to ensure that the people of French Somaliland are given the opportunity to take their rightful place among the community of nations. My delegation is convinced that by enabling the people of French Somaliland to become free and independent France would lay the basis and create conditions for an improved form of relationship which would make for better and stronger ties of friendship and which would be no less rewarding than that which France so happily enjoys with the former African members of the French community.
135.	The Middle East situation, which is like a festering sore that has been allowed to go for too long without treatment, endangers the peace and security of the whole world. It is a tragic example of the result of the lack of a commitment on the part of Member States to take effective action to enforce United Nations decisions arrived at by majority vote. The imposition of an exclusive Zionist State on Arab lands was an historic wrong which laid the basis for the troubles of the Middle East. That injustice was compounded by the failure of the United Nations to set right, at least in part, the injustice done to the dispossessed people of Palestine.
136.	Since 1948 the United Nations has had on its books General Assembly resolution 194 (III), calling for the repatriation or compensation of the Palestinian refugees. Although it has been clear for over 20 years that this issue, more than any other, has led to continuing conflict, one opportunity after another for resolving it has been allowed to go by. When the United Nations, by a narrow majority, gave its approval to the creation of Israel, even those States that supported an exclusive Zionist State in Palestine approved resolution 194 (III) as an attempt to redress wrongs that were clearly recognized. But in seizing the opportunity to give Arab lands to the Jewish people who were being called in from all over the world the Zionist leadership deliberately sabotaged other opportunities to move towards a peaceful settlement. It then became clear that only strong pressure from the major Powers, and in particular from the United States of America, would persuade Israel to conform to the United Nations resolution. Each time a new crisis threatened the peace of the Middle East, and indeed of the world, it was recognized anew by the major Powers that they had been remiss in not acting strongly to bring about a just solution to the Palestine refugee problem. But as the crisis waned and other interests intervened old attitudes of indifference or open hostility towards the implementation of resolution 194 (III) would be resumed. This ambivalent attitude, and the consequent loss of opportunities, was vividly illustrated in the Suez crisis, in 1956, the war of June 1967 and in the intervening periods. The people of Palestine have now taken matters into their own hands and an already difficult situation has grown more complex.
137.	The tragedy that is now taking place in Jordan is a dangerous consequence of our failure to solve the problem. The recent hijackings are another consequence. But the world must at least understand the longstanding frustrations that have led to such desperate actions. The world must understand, too, that the Palestinian people will no longer rely on unenforced resolutions in order to regain their birthright. If that is not recognized, then there is no hope for peace in the Middle East. The Security Council resolution of November 1967 [242 (1967)] contains all the elements for a peaceful settlement, and every effort should be made towards its implementation.
138.	We must not allow this situation to drift unresolved. In the three years that have followed the adoption of that resolution, the Zionist regime has conducted a vicious and continued series of aggressions against neighboring Arab States and has treated the people of the occupied territories with a complete disregard for human rights. Thirty years ago the Nazi regime of Germany was condemned by world opinion for the brutal treatment of the Jewish population under its control and for its expansionist policy at the expense of neighboring States. The Zionists have not yet reached the stage of adopting towards the Arab peoples they have conquered Hitler's 'final solution' to what hi considered to be the Jewish problem. But a pattern reminiscent of nazism is emerging, composed of mass arrests, the expulsion of the population, the brutal treatment of detainees and the expropriation of land and property for the enrichment of the ruling community. How ironic that today some of the victims of the Nazi era should themselves be architects of a campaign of terror and an expansionist policy against the Arab people.
139.	The two prerequisites for a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian problem are, first, the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories and, secondly, full compliance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 194 (III).
140.	The aggression of the United States against the VietNamese people, its invasion of Cambodia and its incursions into Laos are in flagrant violation of international law and constitute a major threat to peace in Asia and the world. The Somali Government is fully sympathetic to the struggle of the VietCong and believes that the presence of United States and other foreign forces in VietNam is the main cause of the terrible suffering the people of that country have had to endure for the last twenty- years. The callous indifference of United States soldiers to the humanity of the VietNamese people lends ugly racist overtones to an already ugly war.
141.	As long as foreign interference continues, the ordeal of the VietNamese people will be prolonged. The war in VietNam is a civil war, and only the people of that territory have the right to determine their future. Foreign interference is also the cause of the recent upheavals in Cambodia and Laos. The invasion of Cambodia by United States armed forces is characteristic of the malaise that has seized IndoChina in the form of the belief that it is possible to bolster up indefinitely Governments which do not have the support of the majority of the people. My Government appeals to the Government of the United States to listen to the voice of the people of the United States, and to the people of the world, who so obviously wish to see an immediate end to this terrible war.
142.	In Korea, as in VietNam, the realities of the situation demand that all forces be withdrawn from the country. My Government believes that the question of the reunification of Korea is a domestic matter that must be solved through direct negotiations between the temporarily divided people of North and South Korea. My delegation reiterates the view it expressed last year, that the true role of the United Nations in Korea is solely to create the conditions and afford the parties concerned the facilities that would enable them to solve their problems in an atmosphere free from outside interference and separate from the political and military consideration of foreign Governments. As a preliminary step, my Government supports the proposal that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should be invited, without conditions, to give the General Assembly its views on the question of the reunification of Korea.
143.	I have concerned myself a great deal so far with the failures of the United Nations which relate directly to human problems, to people denied political and social justice. I should like for a moment to deal with the question of a nation denied justice. I refer to the exclusion of the People's Republic of China from the United Nations. My Government strongly opposes this exclusion on two grounds. First, we support the principle of the universality of the membership of the United Nations, and, secondly, it is perfectly obvious to us, as it is to all who have scrupulous regard for the Charter, that the representatives of the de jure and de facto Government of the People's Republic of China should be able, as by right, to take their place in the Security Council and in the General Assembly.
144.	It is incredibly unrealistic and illogical that a State and nuclear Power with nearly 800 million inhabitants is denied its legitimate seat in the United Nations when we allow in our midst the representatives of Fascist South Africa, who flout all that we stand for in our Charter in their daily atrocities against the indigenous African people. This fact is all the more painful for the Somali delegation because South Africa is our neighbor in the seating arrangements of the United Nations, and we cannot possibly apply the notion 'love thy neighbor', revealed in the Koran and the Bible, and also mentioned by Buddha, as long as the present leaders of that country believe in the hateful and felonious policy of apartheid.
145.	As in previous years, the SecretaryGeneral has pointed out in his introduction to his annual report on the work of the United Nations that:
'	in order to achieve agreement on far
reaching measures of disarmament, it is indispensable that all militarily significant Powers, and in particular all nuclear Powers, including France and the People's Republic of China, should participate in the negotiations' [A180011Add. 1 and Corr.l, para, 27).
It would be a fitting achievement of this anniversary session if agreement could be reached on inviting the People's Republic of China to take its rightful place in the United Nations.
146.	It has been said many times in the past that the United Nations was 'at the crossroads', and this is no doubt being said at the present time when we celebrate the completion of a quarter of a century of existence and embark hopefully on a disarmament decade. It would certainly seem that the signpost which points towards the goal of 'peace, justice and progress' should be labeled 'disarmament'. Progress towards disarmament has been steady, but we have a long way to go along this road. There is a great deal of irony in the fact that while we have been able to prohibit the use of nuclear weapons in outer space and are well on the way towards prohibing their use on the sea-bed we have not been able to prohibit their use on terra firma where such a prohibition is essential for the survival of mankind.	
147.	The arms race in conventional but increasingly deadly weapons affects, in the words of the Secretary General, 'all nations, nuclear and , nonnuclear, developed and developing' [ibid.,para. 20]. While the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)], to which my Government is a party, prohibits the spread of nuclear weapons to nonnuclear Powers, the nuclear Powers continue to carry on underground nuclear tests and to develop new offensive and defensive strategic nuclear weapons systems. The recent dumping of nerve gas into the sea off the United States serves to illustrate the reason why many States have not signed the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and illustrates also the need for a ban on the production of the obscene weapons of bacteriological and chemical warfare.
148.	It is always a matter of satisfaction when we are told that relations between two previously unfriendly countries have been put on a harmonious keel. In this regard, my Government was particularly pleased to learn that the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany had concluded an agreement which marks an important milestone in their relations.
149.	My Government has also noted with interest the improved relations that have developed between the two German States. The existence of these two States, in our view, is part of the political realities of the world today that cannot be ignored.
150.	And now permit me to say a few words about a problem which is of direct concern to my country. It might be recalled that until recently Somalia's dispute with its neighbors v/as often the subject of heated exchanges between our respective delegations in this Assembly hall and at other international conferences. Although these disputes remain unsolved I am glad to say that the tension and acrimony that characterized the situation then has lessened and that there has been a marked improvement in relations as a result of direct talks.
151.	The significance in this shift of approach is to demonstrate our belief that resort to the United Nations should be had only after all other procedures for peaceful settlement have failed. Talks are continuing at a bilateral level and the good offices of the Organization of African Unity are available to us should they become necessary. Our desire for peace and harmony in our region was underlined by the President of the Supreme Revolutionary Council, General Mohamed Syed Barre, when he said recently:
'We do not intend to kindle the fire of destruction in the Horn of Africa. We have heard and some of us have seen the effects and repercussions of war which has twice struck this world and left behind untold sorrow and suffering to mankind. What we intend to do, however, is to press for a peaceful and amicable settlement of all disputes with our neighbors which, if left unresolved, will sow the seeds of suspicion and hatred between the peoples and Governments of our part of the world.'
152.	The motto we have adopted to mark this twenty- fifth anniversary is 'Peace, justice and progress'. The United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights contain the formulas for achieving these ends. But they will never be achieved if Member States continue to regard the Organization as a debating club whose conclusions they are not obliged to support or to translate into effective action. The extent to which we are prepared to act according to the moral and legal codes which we ourselves have fashioned and accepted will determine whether the United Nations will survive and whether its goals will be attained.
"
25,1970,GTM,"196.	: Before starting my statement may I, by your leave, express the condolences of Guatemala to the people and Government of the United Arab Republic on the death of its illustrious President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, which is a manifest loss to the world.
197.	I also wish to express our condolences to the Government of Malaysia o.. the deeply felt death of that great jurist, Ambassador Ramani.
198.	May I express to you, sir, on behalf of my Government, and on my own behalf as your friend for many years, our sincere and cordial congratulations on your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly?
199.	This year in which we commemorate the first quarter-century of the life of our Organization, I should like to give some views on its functioning.
200.	The Organization was created, among other important purposes, to 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war', and, in general, to protect mankind in the economic, social and human rights fields.
201.	As regards the first of these great and noble purposes, to preserve peace, I shall make some comments.
202.	In the field of international law, great efforts have been made and numerous solutions have been attempted to put an end to the tremendous problem of wars. Perhaps the greatest achievement is the very creation of the United Nations.
203.	It has been said that the Organization has not been able fully to discharge one of its primary functions, namely, the maintenance of peace throughout the world. The VietNam war and the latest war in the Middle East have, once again, given a basis for these criticisms. Yet one cannot therefore affirm that the United Nations has not fulfilled any function in the maintenance of peace. The Organization has succeeded in diminishing and resolving some tense situations which have threatened peace and has made it easier for Member States to have access to the mediation required to overcome critical moments and to arrive at peaceful solutions. It has been possible to maintain peace in Cyprus for example. The Emergency Force of the Organization succeeded in maintaining peace, not without great difficulties, in the Middle East. In that same area, recourse was had to United Nations machinery in order to lay down principles for the settlement of the conflict. Earlier, to mention another case, a group of military observers from the United Nations in India and Pakistan managed to contain the tug of war in Kashmir.
204.	In connexion with this work of pacification, it is necessary to mention that the results do not depend exclusively on the Organization. As has been said here, the United Nations is not a superState, it does not possess supranational powers. The maintenance of peace largely depends on the decision and goodwill of States Members in the observance of the purposes and principles of the Charter.
205.	In a sector of activities related to the preservation of peace, some progress has been made. I would mention as examples the 1959 resolution on general and complete disarmament [1378 (XIV)], two treaties of vital importance: or,: on the abolition of nuclear tests and the other on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons; the idea of designating the seabed as a zone reserved exclusively for peaceful purposes; the study by the Disarmament Commission of the question of chemical and bacteriological weapons; the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space; the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations and the item entitled 'Economic and social consequences of the armaments race and its extremely harmful effect on world peace and security'.
206.	Here we should like to mention a regional Latin American effort for peace, the treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons in Latin America, the Tlatelolco Treaty, which has created the first inhabited area in which nuclear weapons are forbidden. My country is a party to this important Treaty and a member of OPANAL, the organization which was established under this international instrument. Guatemala hopes that, like the United Kingdom, other countries outside Latin America, especially the nuclear Powers, will ratify the additional protocols to the Treaty.
207.	There is a relationship between the functions of preserving peace and the right of the veto in the Security Council. It is true that the exercise of the veto by the great powers has created dissatisfaction among some States Members of our Organization, because generally it has been used when an immediate solution of a grave crisis which threatens the peace of the world is being sought in that lofty organ, a solution which is difficult to find because of the absence
, of the concurring votes of the great Powers. This has brought a constant criticism, which has led some to maintain that the preponderance of the great Powers in the Security Council is in open contradiction with the legal equality of States, a fundamental right which is already enshrined in international law and which is derived from the sovereign personality of States.
208.	Such a contradiction is only apparent, in my opinion, because a calm and considered review would lead us to differentiate between two totally different situations: on the one hand a legal category, namely the sovereign equality of States, which has never been questioned and has always been exercised in the General Assembly, the highest body, and in the other United Nations organs. In these forums, States, large and small, participate in the discussion and the adoption of resolutions which in some cases are binding on Member States. The second is the direct function of maintaining peace and the adoption of collective measures to avoid, prevent and put an end to war and aggression, a function which was entrusted in the first instance to the Security Council. Collective action is to a greater degree the responsibility of the great Powers which have to support it militarily and economically, and it is because of this circumstance, which is purely de facto, real and evident, even for the maintenance of world balance, that it is necessary to take action with the consent of the world Powers. Adopting a collective measure against the will of a great Power might mean total war.
209.	Hitherto, the discrepancies in the interests of the great Powers have rendered difficult the adoption of collective measures in the Security Council and have weakened its function to maintain peace in the world. But I sense and feel that these great Powers are beginning to come closer together, as is proved by the bilateral SALT talks, and that they will come to agree that the maintenance of peace in the world is the basis for a better development of their own interests and, therefore, of those of all mankind.
210.	Still on the subject of the maintenance of peace, Guatemala recalls with satisfaction that exactly ten years ago the General Assembly declared that the subjection of peoples to foreign control, domination and exploitation constituted a negation of fundamental human rights and that it jeopardized peace and world cooperation.
211.	My country is in the ranks of those who fought for the cause of the liberation of subject peoples, so as to put an end to colonialism in all its forms and manifestations; it gave its warmest support to resolution 1514 (XV), in the drafting of which it participated, and it will support all measures which in conformity with the Charter are adopted to achieve the independence and freedom of millions of human beings who still suffer in the twentieth century from the opprobrious colonial system.
212.	The liberation of peoples leads me to analyze economic and social problems. We note with some disillusionment that the first United Nations Development Decade fell far short of achieving the aspirations we had for it. It is our most sincere hope that the same will not occur with the Second Development Decade.
213.	In this connexion, we agree that it is the responsibility of all nations to adopt such measures as may be necessary to promote economic activity and social progress. Nevertheless, we are likewise convinced that, without the will and cooperation of the developed countries and unless there prevails a genuine spirit of justice in relations among States, the efforts made by the countries of low per capita income cannot go very far.
214.	Unfortunately, we are fighting against time, and if in this decade that we are now beginning we do not manage to diminish substantially the extreme differences in wealth and the social injustices, the consequences may be irreversible.
215.	For the success of the Second United Nations Development Decade it is necessary to agree on a strategy. In this connexion, we are happy to observe the excellent work done by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and that done by the Preparatory Committee for the Second Development Decade. It is our keenest wish that soon, during the present session of the General Assembly, the Members of this Organization will be united on criteria and establish a strategy which will forestall a new failure.
216.	Guatemala shares the concern of other countries regarding the possibility of a protectionist policy in the more highly industrialized countries, which would render null and void the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade & d Development in regard to universal preferences.
217.	Furthermore, we are concerned about the arms race and the consequent diversion of resources, which could otherwise have been used to increase food production, improve the human environment and alleviate poverty. It is our hope that during the present decade a formula will be found that will lead to general and complete disarmament and that the necessary instruments will be established to utilize the resulting savings for the benefit of the great majority of the world population still suffering from hunger.
218.	Here it is appropriate for me to mention a very important matter. I am referring to the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the SeaBed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction in which a sister republic of Central America, El Salvador, actively participates.
219.	My country is awaiting the results of the work of that Committee to make a careful evaluation and then take a position on this problem, which is so important for the future of mankind.
220.	However, we wish to state in advance our conviction that it would be appropriate to work together on the problems involved in the new law of the sea, so as to find appropriate solutions to the problems of the continental shelf and territorial waters as well as the use of the seabed, the exploitation of natural resources and the preservation of marine species. The latter aspect is of vital importance for many countries, such as mine, which seek a guarantee of the development of the resources of the sea for the benefit of the coastal populations. At the last Conference, recently held in Lima, on this subject, the delegation of Guatemala stated: 'What we wish to know is whether the sea, at least that adjoining our coast, will serve to feed our people or will continue to be the business of the large fishing fleets' of the super developed countries.
221.	At the outset of my statement I spoke about certain fundamental purposes of the Organization, such as the preservation of peace and in general the protection of mankind in the economic and social fields and in the field of human rights. In contrast to those noble purposes of the United Nations, in various parts of the world and here I must include my own country subversive acts are committed which, in some cases, in a rampant torrent of violence and in absolute negation of human rights, are reprehensible crimes, committed with the ultimate aim of invalidating fundamental State institutions.
222.	Also within the context of violence, I wish to mention specifically two matters of the utmost gravity.
One is the hijacking of aircraft, which is manifestly a collective threat to the security and lives of persons, and which, in certain circumstances, may create situations that jeopardize peace; the other is the kidnapping of important persons, such as diplomatic agents, which may have the effect of disturbing international coexistence. In the opinion of my country, in connexion with these two subjects the hijacking of aircraft and the kidnapping of important persons we should adopt adequate solutions at the regional level and here at the United Nations, within the framework of international law and of penal laws. Until specific international standards on these subjects are established we consider that it is the duty of States to apply existing penal standards and extradition provisions.
223.	In conclusion, I should like to mention the Central American question. Guatemala is very happy to see the positive steps being taken to bring the sister republics of El Salvador and Honduras closer to one another which, we are sure, will lead to a definitive solution of the conflict that has arisen between those two countries. In making this statement, we express our confidence in the process of Central American integration which is already leading to the creation of an area of progress and wellbeing for our peoples.
224.	On this matter, as on previous occasions when representatives of Guatemala spoke from this rostrum, I wish to remind the General Assembly of the existence of an old dispute with the United Kingdom concerning Belize. We now reiterate our faith in the peaceful means of settling international disputes as provided for in the United Nations Charter. Furthermore, we are convinced that the people of Belize will find the most just expression of its destiny within the Central American context.
225.	Guatemala, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, once again expresses its faith in the Organization. It is our profound conviction that on balance its record of achievement is a positive one. We offer our most determined cooperation so that it may achieve a yet loftier stature because, in the last analysis, it is mankind's best effort until now for its own survival.




"
25,1970,KWT,"1.	   Mr. President, your election to the august position of President of the General Assembly during the present session is tantamount to consecrating the principles which should prevail in our agitated world. My Government would like to offer its felicitations on this happy election as it believes that it will immensely facilitate the work of the present session, owing to your long experience in United Nations affairs, your outstanding reputation in international relations and your exceptional ability and talent.
2.	We celebrate during the present session the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, which was founded to save coming generations from the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and to establish conditions under which justice can be maintained at a time when the world is convulsed by turmoil, division and violation of the rights of people to live and survive, and while weapons of mass destruction are being stockpiled.
3.	This unhappy situation is basically due to a disrespect for the purposes and principles of the United Nations and a disregard for United Nations resolutions. It has deprived the United Nations of efficacy and turned it into an impotent organ, passively watching the sad events in the world without being able to play the role assigned to it in the maintenance of international peace and security.
4.	Kuwait has consistently expressed its deep faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter. While reaffirming its faith in these principles during the present session, it calls upon the international community to discuss the most effective means of strengthening and developing the United Nations machinery.
5.	Having made these general observations about the United Nations, I now proceed to consider briefly the role which the Organization has played, as well as the role it is called upon to play, with respect to the intricate crises in our region, which have been gaining in complexity every day.
6.	An objective look at the development of history in the Middle East over the last quarter of a century leads to the inescapable conclusion that the United Nations bears the principal responsibility for the rise of those conditions which formed the root cause of the successive explosions in the region, and that it was responsible also for the aggravation of those conditions as well as for the failure to arrive at just solutions.
7.	This responsibility springs from the actions as well as the inaction of the United Nations.
8.	At the outset, it was the actions taken by the United Nations, in disregard of both the principles of the Charter and the constitutional limitations of its own powers, that gave rise to conditions which soon became, in turn, the cause of continuous tensions and escalating conflicts. For it cannot be gainsaid that the recommendation made by the General Assembly twenty-three years ago to partition Palestine [resolution 181 (II)], in spite of the opposition of its indigenous and rightful inhabitants, and to establish in Palestine a political entity reserved for aliens and based on racial segregation and exclusionism, was the initial cause of persistent trouble in our region.
9.	This initial action was followed by United Nations inaction. The United Nations failed to adopt necessary corrective measures, even when such measures were called for by its Charter and would have fallen within its competence. Such inaction gave rise to continuing tension and escalating conflicts. Thus, the United Nations refrained from taking decisive action when the alien, racist body planted in Palestine proceeded to displace the indigenous population and take possession of their private and public property. The United Nations refrained from intervening to implement its successive resolutions calling for the return of the displaced Palestinians to their homeland. It also refrained from intervening when the alien body abrogated the armistice agreements it had signed with neighboring Arab States. And it refrained from intervening when that alien body expanded by war, doubling and redoubling the area of the territories it had originally seized.
A/PV. 1849
10.	Had the United Nations taken the opposite course, had it refrained from taking those initial measures which it was not within its rights to take 
and had it actually taken decisive action of a preventive or corrective nature when such action was both right and mandatory, the Middle East would not have been burdened by the turmoil and anguish from which it suffers today. Indeed, the whole world would have been spared the anguish of those periodic convulsions which have brought it several times in the past quarter century and bring it again today to the very brink of danger. And, above all, an entire generation of an innocent Arab people would have been spared its tragedy: of coming into being, growing and reaching maturity in the shadow of injustice and deprivation; of the resultant embitterment, desperation and rebelliousness; and of the compulsion to travel the path of ascending violence towards regaining lost rights.
11.	That then is the first lesson to be derived from a fair-minded review of the interplay of the actions and inaction of the United Nations with the rise and exacerbation of problems in the Middle East. The first lesson pertains to the past; the second, to the future.
12.	The United Nations and all its Members have a special responsibility to put an end to the suffering of which the Organization was the original cause, to achieve a just settlement of the resultant conflicts and to pave the way for a secure and happy future in the region.
13.	If the determination to discharge this responsibility faithfully and adequately obtains, the following four fundamentals will jointly constitute the appropriate starting-point.
14.	First, violations of international law and the principles of the Charter must no longer be permitted, and past perpetrators of such violations must not be permitted to continue to reap the benefits derived therefrom.
15.	Secondly, no acceptable, secure and durable system can be erected on the basis of those very wrongs which have so far produced nothing save injustice, hate and turmoil.
16.	Thirdly, no solution can be found for the present crises through continued disregard of the primary victim, which has had thus far to pay the highest price for the wrongs committed by others. I refer to the Palestinian people its majority displaced, its homeland occupied, its national wealth despoiled and its dignity desecrated.
17.	Fourthly, this people may not be expected to acquiesce in the fait accompli forcibly achieved on its own land at the expense of its own rights and aspirations. Nor may it be asked to accept and give its blessing to that fait accompli nor to any solution of the current problems which is predicated on the continued displacement of that people and its continued deprivation of its natural rights. The General Assembly, which rightly decided at its past session to reaffirm 'the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine' [resolution 2535 B (XXIV)] must not permit that declaration to remain as countless other resolutions relating to the
Palestinian people have remained purely verbal and therefore hollow.
18.	From those four fundamentals there emerges a procedural principle which should guide the United Nations in its efforts to resolve the crises of the Middle East.
19.	Progress towards that end cannot be achieved through the attempt to formulate one comprehensive and integrated solution to all facets of the problem at once, or a 'package deal', which would be put into effect at one and the same time. Progress can only be achieved through identifying the root cause and the most important ramifications of the whole problem, applying the principles of the Charter regarding them, and thereby creating a climate conducive to further progress in resolving the remaining issues.
20.	Two elements of the problem stand out as having absolute priority, namely, continued Israeli occupation of territories of Arab States Members of the United Nations and continued dispersion of displaced Palestinians who have been barred from return to their homeland and homes.
21.	The United Nations does not possess the right to adopt towards either of these issues any position other than that which is prescribed by the Charter and repeatedly enunciated by competent organs of the United Nations informal resolutions. The only solution to military occupation is withdrawal. The only solution to displacement is repatriation, that is to say, the return of the displaced to their homes, their resumption of normal life in dignity in their homeland and the exercise of their natural right to self-determination on their soil.
22.	When the determination to apply faithfully the principles of the Charter with regard to these two issues comes to obtain at the United Nations, and when this has been accomplished, it will be possible to look forward to steady progress towards removing the remaining obstacles impeding the achievement of ajust peace.
23.	I have spoken thus far of the responsibilities of the United Nations as a whole and all its Members. I must add a word about the big Powers in particular. The big Powers, which initially stood behind the 'original sin' in the Middle East and therefore bear special responsibility for the consequences thereof, have aimed in fact at more than just that in pursuit of their interests and ambitions in the region. They may have imagined, and still imagine, that the liquidation of the Palestine problem in a manner which would entrench the fait accompli without redressing wrongs and restoring rights would usher in chaos and turmoil throughout the Arab world, which would in turn serve as a golden opportunity for safeguarding existing big Power interests or achieving outstanding ambitions in the region.
24.	The big Powers hope to exploit the crisis of the Arab world in Palestine through fomenting other crises for the Arab nation as a result of which those Powers would be able to subdue the Arab will and exploit the resources of the Arab world without fear of effective resistance.
25.	Such planning will founder on the rock of reality. There is sufficient alertness in the Arab world to such designs, coupled with commensurate determination to safeguard Arab sovereignty and dignity, to frustrate and defeat these designs whatever may be the current manifestations of the possibility of chaos and turmoil emerging as a reaction to the attempts to bring about an unjust settlement to the problem of Palestine.
26.	The big Powers will discover that this road to the Arab world is in fact a blind alley. They should know that legitimate, mutual interests may be better and more fully and securely safeguarded through stability resting on satisfaction and consent aiv.d that they cannot be served by the ushering in of chaos and turmoil. As for illegitimate ambitions, which elicit no Arab responsiveness or consent, they can be neither attained nor safeguarded whether by the exploitation or fomentation of crises or by resort to force in the aftermath thereof.
27.	The area of the seabed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction is full of promise, as its vast virgin resources should be used to bridge the gap between the developing and developed countries. This, however, can only be done under an international legal regime based on the concept that the area and its resources are the common heritage of mankind, and should be established by a basic international treaty of a universal character.
28.	Such a regime will remain a mere abstract idea unless international machinery is established as an integral part of it and its executive arm. The Kuwait Government has consistently advocated that the international machinery should have jurisdiction over the area and its resources, and be endowed with comprehensive powers which will enable it to exercise both regulatory and operational functions. The machinery should play an effective role in preventing severe fluctuation of prices of mineral resources in world markets. This is a vital issue for those developing countries that depend entirely on the production of nonrenewable raw materials.	<
29.	It is a matter of urgent importance that a declaration of principles for the regime governing the area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction should be proclaimed as early as possible.
30.	In upholding the provisions of resolution 2574 D (XXIV), my Government is opposed to the establishment of any interim regime which will allow technologically advanced countries to have a free hand in the area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.
31.	I should also like to affirm that my Government objects to the concept of an international trusteeship to be exercised by coastal States on any part of the area lying beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. This is a trusteeship in name only as its real purpose is to make the highly developed countries the major beneficiaries of the exploitation of the area which belongs to mankind as a whole.
32.	My country, which takes pride in the role which has enabled it to assist effectively in promoting the economic and social development of sister and friendly developing countries, attaches special importance to the Second United Nations Development Decade. Though there are encouraging signs that the strategy will soon be launched, yet we have serious apprehensions about the reluctance of most of the developed countries to accept firm commitments. It is not sufficient to lay down broad objectives. We must also define policy measures and programs of action. Commitments, therefore, must be very precise and of a binding character. A timetable should be set for the implementation of the targets. The strategy should emphasize the interdependence of the world economy and the necessity of making opportunities equally available to all nations, especially the developing countries.
33.	The ultimate aim of the strategy should be to enable the developing countries to become self sufficient through the increase in their export earnings and the diversification of their domestic economies. I would like to express the fervent hope that the new strategy will prove to be a landmark in heralding a new era of cooperation among all nations regardless of their economic and social systems.
34.	The main problem which confronts us during the present session is to strive to find some means for rescuing the United Nations from its present apathy and stagnation as we cannot imagine a world without such an international body. The other alternative can only be anarchy and abuse of power which would threaten the future of mankind.
35.	The use of force, invasion, occupation, territorial aggrandizement and apartheid have become dangerous practices in the world today. Those who perpetrate these vile deeds now believe that they have acquired a right to invade and occupy the territories of other States and face the world with a fait accompli, and that they are free to dictate terms for relinquishing part of the territories under their occupation which they had seized by force. Unless we all collaborate to strengthen the machinery of the United Nations by giving it the power to take action for the discharge of its responsibilities, humanity will be faced with a dismal future indeed.
36.	It is essential that all States should be allowed to join the United Nations according to the principle of universality and as a means of strengthening the world Organization so that it may become an effective instrument in maintaining international peace and security and meting out justice in the world. It will be incumbent upon the new Members to accept the obligations embodied in the Charter and contribute to solving world problems in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Charter. Hence we call for seating the People's Republic of China in the United Nations so that it may play an effective role in our Organization.
37.	We call for the withdrawal of all American and other foreign troops from IndoChina so that the countries of that region may exercise freely their right to self-determination without foreign interference. We also call on all United Nations Members to comply with United Nations resolutions imposing an embargo on Portugal and South Africa, in order to put an end to apartheid in Africa. Kuwait thus acts in accordance with the resolutions of the nonaligned summit conference recently held in Zambia  which delegated to President Kaunda the task of communicating its resolutions to the United Nations.
38.	The world is fervently yearning for peace peace based on justice, peace based on right, peace based on the right of peoples to live in freedom and dignity. As one month exactly from today we shall celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, it may be pertinent to proclaim as a theme 'peace based on justice' and to adhere strictly to this theme, which is the best tribute we can pay to this great anniversary.



"
25,1970,ALB,"33: May I first convey to our President the congratulations of the Albanian delegation on his election to the Presidency of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly?
34.	In taking up the work on the agenda of the twenty- fifth session of the General Assembly, which is being held on the eve of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the coming into force of the Charter of the United Nations, the peace-loving Member States would have wished to be in a position to present on this occasion some picture of positive and satisfactory activity on the part of the United Nations. The Albanian delegation, for its part, would have taken great pleasure in drawing up such a balance sheet of activities covering a quarter of a century, which is certainly no short period in the life of an international organization. Unfortunately, this is not the situation. Created on the day after victory had been achieved over the Powers of the Rome BerlinTokyo Axis and conceived in the spirit of the principles which predominated in the war of the antiFascist coalition, the Organization awakened in the whole of progressive humanity the hope that it would serve as an important factor in creating better international conditions in order to favor the cause of freedom, peace and world security. But its activities and a number of events which occurred in the world arena during that period disappointed the hopes of peoples. The United Nations, far from having contributed, as required by the fundamental provisions of the Charter, to the consolidation of international peace and security and the liberation struggle of peoples, has on the contrary, under the diktat of the imperialist powers, the United States of America foremost among them, embarked on a path diametrically opposed to those principles, and has served as an instrument favoring their policy of pillage, oppression and aggression against peace-loving peoples and countries.
35.	The utilization of the United Nations to serve this policy has resulted in the Organization not only not having been able to stay the hand of those committing aggression in many parts of the world, but having frequently helped the aggressors, its activity in this direction going so far, moreover, that under the flag of the United Nations there have been perpetrated some of the most barbarous aggressions experienced since the end of the Second World War, such as, among others, the armed aggressions in Korea and in the Congo.
36.	The whole of progressive mankind recalls with admiration the heroic struggle which, under the direction of the great Stalin, the Soviet Union waged, in cooperation with the AngloAmerican coalition, to defend the peaceful peoples and countries against Hitlerite Germany. The historic and decisive victories of the Red Army over the Nazi hordes and the great role played by the Soviet Union during the Second World War aroused great enthusiasm among peoples and awakened in them the hope for a better future. They followed with great interest and with particular joy the unflinching struggle which was waged by the Leninist Soviet Union in the world arena, as well as by its authentic representatives here in this Organization, in order to defend their vital interests and to sustain their legitimate struggle for liberation from the imperialist, colonialist and racist yoke. But following the usurpation of power in that country by the Khrushchev clique, the situation changed completely, and the struggle of the Soviet Union against American imperialism and its allies was replaced by the holy alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States against the peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples and countries. It is thus that, so far as the United Nations is concerned, it has become a center of bargaining, maneuvering and underhand manipulations on the part of the American imperialists and the Soviet social-imperialists, designed to lull the vigilance of peoples and to disguise as best they can their policy of world hegemony.
37.	All this has had well known consequences for the United Nations, which have been particularly damaging to its authority and its ability to play the part which is incumbent upon it under the Charter. But, at the same time, this negative activity has helped peoples to realize better the nature of the two imperialist Powers and what can be expected from the United Nations in the present circumstances where it is being manipulated by those two Powers. It has, in particular, become obvious to them that all the initiatives and proposals of American governing circles and of Moscow revisionists in connexion with disarmament and all the agreements which they seek to impose on other States in this field, with respect to both conventional armaments and nuclear armaments, are designed solely to disarm peace-loving countries and to ensure for themselves the nuclear monopoly and the largest possible quantity of armaments of all sorts in order to subjugate peoples and to enslave the world which they wish to divide between them. Peoples are becoming more aware than ever that the only way for them to break free from every imperialist, colonialist and racist yoke is through armed struggle and trust in their own strength, while at the same time enjoying the solidarity and the support of all other freedom-loving peoples and countries.
38.	One of the undeniable proofs that the United Nations has embarked on the road of violating the principles and spirit of the Charter is the withholding for 21 years of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in this Organization, a circumstance which not only has brought about an abnormal situation without precedent in this Organization and constituted a severe blow to its prestige, but also has at the same time affected its capacity regarding the contribution which it should make to the settlement of the important problems of our time, none of which, as we well know, can be given a real solution without the participation of the great socialist China of 700 million people.
39.	Undoubtedly, such a state of affairs in this Organization does not discourage the Member States who espouse the fundamental principles of the Charter. On the contrary, trusting in their own strength and their own possibilities and encouraged by the development and the victories of the liberation struggle waged by peoples in all continents, they will redouble their efforts and cooperate more closely in order to wage a more effective battle against the policy of diktat and force which has been practiced by the two great imperialist Powers here in the United Nations or elsewhere in the world.
40.	The liberation movement at the world level against the imperialist and colonialist Powers is at present making new strides. The peoples have reacted to the policy of oppression and domination practiced by the imperialist Powers and their aggressions and plots, by strengthening their just struggle for independence and freedom and joining the ranks of the armed struggle against the aggressors. This is shown by the struggle of the heroic peoples of VietNam, Laos, Cambodia and other countries of Indo-China, the straggle of the people of Korea and other peoples of the Far East against the United States imperialists, their allies and their tools, the struggle of the valiant Palestinians and other Arab peoples against imperialistZionist aggression, the struggle of the peoples of Oman and Dhofar and the peoples of the Arabian Gulf to free themselves from the colonial yoke, the resistance of the peoples of Eastern Europe against the domination of the new imperialists of the Kremlin, the struggle of the African peoples of Mozambique, Angola, Guinea (Bissau), Namibia, Southern Rhodesia and South Africa against the colonial Powers, the settlers and their racist tools, the struggle of the people of Puerto Rico to free themselves from the imperialist yoke of the United States, as well as all those struggles that are being waged by peoples in various parts of the world, including that of the American people in the very citadel of imperialism. The imperialist Powers and their allies are suffering defeat after defeat. Powerful blows have been struck against them everywhere by the peoples that are struggling for their national independence, for their freedom and for their sacred and inalienable right to be masters of their own destiny.
41.	Panic-stricken at the impetuous growth of the revolutionary struggle for the liberation of peoples and assailed by multiple internal and external difficulties, the two so-called superPowers, American imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism, which are at the head of all reactionary forces, are striving by all means in their power to face up to this desperate situation and to accelerate the implementation of their aggressive and warlike plans against peace-loving peoples and countries. These two Powers have during this period intensified their collusion and their criminal activities, using deceit and demagogy as well as various forms of pressure, force and armed aggression.
42.	Although split by numerous contradictions deriving from their imperialist nature, each trying to undermine the other and to evict the other from its political, economic and strategic positions, these two superPowers have a common hatred for the freedom of peoples and the socialist revolution. It is on that basis that rest their cooperation and their aggressive activities, their plans and their plots, which extend to all continents in conformity with their global counterrevolutionary strategy, which is designed to divide and dominate the world. The Glasborough policy is pursued uninterruptedly, and AmericanSoviet collusion has taken fresh steps forward. Under the guise of peaceful slogans for the 'peaceful settlement' of conflicts which have been brought about precisely by the aggressions which they themselves have perpetrated or directed, for European, Asian or international 'security' which is in fact nothing but the security of the imperialist order for disarmament, for 'internationalism' which presupposes 'limited sovereignty', or more exactly the subjugation of peoples and nations, as well as other slogans, they plot and they coordinate their positions and their activities regarding various problems which affect the interests of mankind as a whole. Using such slogans, they are hatching plans and trying to impose so-called peaceful settlements by means of which they are trying to repress the liberation struggle waged by peoples; they are concluding treaties which are both fraudulent and enslaving and they are trying to conclude new aggressive pacts which will be added to the pacts, blocs and military bases that are now in existence; they are exerting pressure of all sorts on the freedom-loving peoples and countries that dare to resist them; they are carrying on the arms race and the preparations for a new war; they indulge in nuclear blackmail and fresh acts of aggression.
43.	In that connexion we can cite, simultaneously with the secret negotiations of the two Powers through diplomatic channels, the long meetings of their representatives in Helsinki and later in Vienna, meetings which certainly are not limited to the question of the 'limitation of strategic arms', the socalled Rogers plan for a 'peaceful settlement' of the Middle East problem, a plan which is the result of the American Soviet plot designed to stifle the legitimate liberation struggle of the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples, which is at the origin of the bloody events which have taken place recently in Jordan. Of a similar nature are the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on Indo-China and the meetings organized in Moscow and elsewhere with representatives of the reactionary regimes in Asia to bring about a 'peaceful settlement' of that problem a settlement which they believe will lead to the capitulation of the peoples of VietNam, Laos and Cambodia the travels of high emissaries of those two Powers in Asia and their efforts to create there new aggressive pacts in accordance with the Brezhnev plan for the 'collective security of Asia' and the Nixon plan to pit Asiatics against Asiatics, plans which have been concerted between those two Powers and are designed first and foremost to create a circle of fire around the People's Republic of China. In the same category we should mention the enslaving SovietCzechoslovak treaty as well as the MoscowBonn treaty, which among other things tramples under foot the sovereign rights of the German people of the Democratic Republic of Germany and which, together with the SovietAmerican project on so-called European security, relates to the spheres of influence of the two Powers in Europe and their rearguard activities on that continent in order to implement their counterrevolutionary plans in Asia, Africa and elsewhere.
44.	In order to bring about this great anti-popular conspiracy, the American and Soviet imperialists are applying a series of political, economic and military measures, such as intensifying the imperialist American aggression in Laos and the new aggression against Cambodia, plots and wiles designed to divide the Arab peoples and countries and plunge them into bloody and fratricidal conflict and to repress by all means possible, including armed force, the legitimate struggle of the heroic people of Palestine. Of a similar nature also are the threats and the measures taken by the Soviet revisionists against the peoples of Eastern European countries, including the military maneuvers of Soviet occupation forces in Czechoslovakia, carried out last August to intimidate the people on the eve of the second anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.
45.	Thus the two Powers stop at nothing to realize their imperialist plans to stifle the revolutionary struggle of peace-loving peoples and countries, to establish their domination of the world and to arrogate to themselves the role of international police in order to decide in their own good time the fate of humanity.
46.	However, those are castles in the air. The wheel of history cannot be turned backwards. The era when the fate of peoples and of small countries was decided by the great imperialist Powers has gone for ever. The more the imperialists intensify their aggressive activities, the more the peoples strengthen their own struggle and the more the peoples strengthen their own struggle and the more closely they become united in the vast front of the armed struggle against the common enemy. Never will the peoples renounce their legitimate struggle to win back their vital rights. Despite temporary vicissitudes, their struggle is on the whole increasing and being strengthened and it appears now more than 'ever before that a storm of liberation is breaking throughout Asia, Africa and elsewhere, a storm which will completely annihilate, in spite of underhanded maneuvers and repressions, imperialist and colonialist domination in whatever form it may exist.
47.	A recent example which is the best illustration of what awaits the American imperialists and their policy of intervention and war is the armed aggression they perpetrated against Cambodia last March, immediately after the coup d'etat which they plotted in that country. Faced with an impasse because of the blows meted out in the struggle of the VietNamese people, the American aggressors sent their troops to Cambodia in order to implement there the 'Nixon doctrine', which is designed to pit IndoChinese against IndoChinese. But this aggression, far from leading to the expected results, immediately met with the armed resistance of the people of Cambodia and the military solidarity of their VietNamese and Laotian brothers, powerfully supported by the great Chinese people as well as by the other peoples of Asia. It aroused energetic opposition on the part of peoples throughout the world, including the American people. Instead of stifling the liberation struggle of the VietNamese people, the aggression against Cambodia has spread throughout Indo-China the fire of the liberation and revolutionary struggle and has opened an even wider and deeper abyss, where American imperialism will finally be engulfed without any hope of being rescued.
48.	The success gained by the Cambodian people, under the leadership of the United Front of Cambodia, presided over by the Head of State, Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, in liberating a large part of the national territory from the aggressors and their lackeys, and the solidarity and new consolidation of the unity of the peoples of Cambodia, VietNam, Laos, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as of other revolutionary peoples in Asia, constitute a harsh blow to American imperialism, its collaborators and its lackeys.
49.	The American aggression against Cambodia is at the same time further proof of the collusion, at the expense of the people, of American imperialism with the revisionists of Moscow, the latter having adopted for this occasion an attitude similar to that of the American Government towards their aggression in Czechoslovakia. In particular, their refusal to recognize the Government of the United Front of Cambodia and the fact that they maintain normal diplomatic relations with the Lon Nol clique, an instrument of American imperialism supported by the puppets in Saigon and Seoul and even by the riffraff of Chiang Kaishek, as well as by international reaction as a whole, have once again revealed to world public opinion the true
way with the camp of imperialism and reaction.
50.	The events of the current year in Cambodia and throughout Indo-China are of great importance for the IndoChinese peoples, which not only now have fresh proof of the obstinacy of American imperialism in carrying out acts of aggression and extending the war, but also now are in a better position to decide who is sincerely against the Yankee invader and who is with him, what the Soviet social-imperialists are and what great socialist China represents for them. Thus they realize once again that armed struggle is the only way to become free of the American aggressors.
51.	Despite the intensification of the efforts of the American imperialists, backed up by the Soviet revisionists, the valiant people of VietNam has thwarted all the plans and dangerous subterfuges designed to bring about its capitulation. Throughout South VietNam the people and its popular liberation army have taken up arms and struck crushing blows against the American aggressors, without giving them a moment of respite even in their military camps and bases, such as Da Nang, Ben Tre, Hue, the outskirts of Saigon and other parts of the country. The VietNamese people and its armed forces have, through their brilliant victories, tied down the American imperialists and their Saigon tools on the battlefield. These victories have shown undeniably that the efforts of the Yankee aggressors to escape inevitable defeat by extending the war have brought them only further irreparable reversals. The long revolutionary struggle has tempered the VietNamese people and has made it invincible, and by its determined and heroic struggle it will undoubtedly deal ever more crushing blows at American imperialism until it is completely defeated.
52.	The armed struggle for the national wellbeing of the peoples^ of VietNam, Laos and Cambodia is constantly developing and being reinforced; it is now in a new stage. All the criminal plots which the American and Soviet imperialists have hatched in order to bring about a so-called peaceful settlement in Indo-China are doomed to complete failure. American imperialism is surrounded and defeated on all fronts. It is bound to be beaten.
53.	A typical case which shows the ferocity of the great AmericanSoviet conspiracy and the method of combining the most diverse means of action on the part of these imperialist Powers in order to carry out their policy of aggression and hegemony is the tragic and serious situation which prevails at the present time in the Near East. Concerned with implementing at all costs their common plan of sad repute baptized the Rogers plan designed to liquidate the Palestinian question and to divide the Arab peoples, to legalize and to reward the imperialistIsraeli aggression and to assure their imperialist interests in that area, the United States and the revisionist Soviet Union have plotted and put into effect the criminal collusion designed to stifle the Palestinian liberation movement through the reactionary regime of Jordan, thus trying to implement in the Near East the Nixon doctrine aimed at pitting Asians against Asians. Thus Jordanian reaction, serving American imperialism and Zionism, has used fire and sword, cannons, tanks and aviation against the heroic Palestinian fighters. Barbarous mass massacres have been perpetrated against the Palestinian population in Amman and elsewhere. At the same time, American imperialism, by statements from Nixon, Laird and other leaders, threatens to intervene in the internal affairs of the Arab countries and also threatens intervention by its Sixth Fleet, thus trying, as always, to play the role of international policeman to oppress peoples and suppress liberation struggles, to defend those cliques which are in their pockets, to defend their rapacious interests and to enslave peoples.
54.	American imperialism and world reaction consider as unfair the fraternal assistance given by Syria and Iraq to their Arab brothers who are struggling for a just cause, for their common cause. According to their logic they have the right and the freedom to intervene in all countries, everywhere; they can utilize tanks, cannons, and their war fleets to oppress and exploit the peoples of other countries, whereas Syria and Iraq are not entitled to come to the aid of their brothers.
55.	A wave of indignation and resentment has been unleashed throughout the progressive world. Quite rightly, the conscience of the Arab peoples has revolted against the treachery of the ruling clique in Jordan. And the world wonders: Why are tanks and bullets being used against the Palestinians? Is it because they are struggling for their liberty, for independence and for their sacred land?
56.	The peoples of all continents, profoundly indignant, are raising their voices in protest against the American imperialists and the Soviet socio imperialists; they are crying: 'Hands off the Palestinian people, Jordan, Syria and the other Arab countries.'
57.	It is quite clear that the Palestinians are not obeying the 'Rogers plan'. They know full well that the American plan which is based on the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967 [242 (1967)] which, as we know, is itself the result of bargaining in the corridors between the Americans and the Soviets is designed, inter alia, to impose the elimination of the Palestinian question and the recognition of Israel's right to annex part of the territories which it invaded following its aggression of 5 June 1967. This plan is also designed to reward the Zionist aggression by guaranteeing the existence of the State of Israel, which has taken over Arab territories which were also conquered by aggression, and also by recognizing other rights. Still worse, the two 'superPowers' want to use the new ceasefire to continue the maneuvers and machinations which they have engaged in for the past three years in order once again to apply the tactics used by the imperialist powers after the Israeli aggression of 1948, with the aim of putting off for ever the fulfillment of the sacred cause of the Arabs and thus making a fait accompli out of Israel's new occupation of their territories.
58.	No, the Arab people will never accept the United StatesSoviet diktat, which is designed to bring about their recapitulation. The Palestinian people and the other Arab peoples have rejected this plot. The efforts of the United States imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are in vain. The Arab peoples have a long experience, and they well know the Israeli aggressors and their masters. Never will they allow the two foreign Powers to decide their fate, whatever be their machinations and their sharing of roles, one presenting itself as the author of the criminal plan and the other giving that plan its support.
59.	The Arab peoples know full well that any proposal by the United States of America, which incited and assisted Israel to unleash aggression three years ago and which continues to provide Israel with armaments and encourages it to pursue its aggression and provocation, is designed simply to serve the imperialist interests of that Power in the area of the Near East, which is of great strategic importance and is rich in petroleum deposits, as well as the interests of Israel, its instrument. It is obvious and no one could deny it that without the assistance and support of the United States Israel would never have been in a position to initiate the aggression of June 1967, and even less to continue to occupy the Arab territories.
60.	With regard to the Soviet revisionists, whatever mask they may put on, the Arab peoples know their faces, especially since the AmericanIsraeli aggression, and they are convinced that what they are interested in is penetrating into the Near East and the Mediterranean Basin and creating conditions favorable for their expansion in that area.
61.	The leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, referring to this problem in his statement of 18 September to the electors of Tirana, said, among other things:
'In the final analysis, the glorious revolutionary Arab peoples will not have the wool pulled over their eyes by the false friendship of Soviet social imperialism, which has taken advantage of their temporary difficulties to occupy their ports and their seas and to stifle their just liberation struggle against the Fascist Zionists and the United States imperialists. The two aggressive imperialist Powers are interested in planting their roots deep in the Near East and in ensuring that they have economic, political and military bases in the countries of the area; they want to oppress the peoples of those countries, lulling them with words, demoralizing them and corrupting them in order, finally, by the use of those bases, to go even further and invade Africa, Asia and other regions, starting colonial wars and plundering various continents.
'The Albanian people love the Arab peoples, because they are their brothers and their friends in good times and in bad. At this time of revolutionary and liberation struggles, we are at their side constantly; we have supported them and will continue to support them with all the means at our disposal. We have confidence in the triumph of the just cause for which they are fighting. But, in order to win an early victory over the common enemy, a unity that is hard as steel must be forged among all the Arab peoples in the armed struggle. The Zionists, the United States imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are seeking to divide the Arab peoples, to disarm them, to impose on them a peace that will be not theirs but their enemies'. The arms that have been supplied to them are controlled by the Soviets. They have not been made available for the sacred Arab cause, but they are being used precisely to deceive the Arabs, to tie their hands and send them to the slaughterhouse. The 'Rogers plan' of ill repute could more accurately be called the 'RogersGromyko plan'. The Arab peoples will certainly never fall into the terrible trap of that plan. The SovietUnited States armies can, by recourse to various insidious means, succeed in establishing themselves on both sides of the Suez Canal, in which case one may wonder what purpose the hardware supplied to the Arabs by the Soviets would serve. They have not heroically driven one imperialist from the Canal only to see it occupied now by two others.
'The clamoring of Day an are in harmony with the secret maneuvers of the Soviet revisionists, but the crackling of the heroic guns of the Arab Palestinian brothers is the most glorious reply, which will put down this great conspiracy of their enemies. Therefore, by all possible means, we must resolutely assist the partisan struggle of the Palestinians, a struggle that is now in the forefront of the more general battle which must be waged by Arab peoples on all fronts. Our Arab brothers will succeed in raising high the banner of the liberation struggle against the imperialists and Zionists. They will reduce to nothing the plans of the Soviet revisionists and all the provocations organized by the agencies of the CIA which are conspiring against the liberation struggle of the people of Palestine and all the Arab peoples.'
62.	The Arab peoples have great revolutionary traditions and are known for their bravery and their liberation struggles. They know that they are not fighting against the Israeli aggressors only, but also against the two imperialist Powers which are mainly responsible for the situation in the Near East and, therefore, they will not allow themselves to fall into the traps of those Powers.
63.	The events of recent days in Jordan have confirmed that, as the leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, indicated in his statement of 18 September, Soviet social-imperialism is pursuing aims that have nothing in common with the interests of the Arab peoples. As on other occasions, they are not at all concerned with the fate of the Arab peoples; their sole aim is to consolidate their imperialist positions. In this particular case, the Soviet revisionist leaders, replying to Nixon's appeal to bring in Moscow's fire brigade to snuff out the revolutionary struggle of the Palestinians and other Arab peoples, to subjugate and enslave them, hastened to assume the role of firemen. Through their official declarations and propaganda organs, they came to the defense of the clique in power in Jordan, threatening the Palestinians with the slogan 'Violence leads to violence', and addressing appeals to them and other Arab peoples asking them to give up their struggle. All those facts have served to make even more obvious to the Arab peoples the perfidious role being played by the social imperialists of Moscow and the real aims of the United StatesSoviet plan for the Near East.
64.	The Palestinians consider Jordan as their second homeland. They are not the cause of disruption in Jordan; rather, the fault lies with the reactionary regime in Jordan and King Hussein, who is in the service of United States imperialism and the 'Rogers plan'. On the contrary, the Palestinians in Jordan are the healthiest element in the common struggle to annihilate the common enemy.
65.	The Albanian people is profoundly indignant, strongly condemns those criminal acts and supports the heroic struggle of the Palestinians who are fighting for their sacred rights. We are convinced that, thanks to their resolute struggle and the strengthening of their unity in combat, and enjoying the support of their true friends, of all freedom-loving peoples, they will expose the plots of their enemies and gain final victory over the aggressors.
66.	In the dealings between the United States and the Soviet Union, an important place is held also by the so-called question of the European security conference, proposed last year by the Kremlin leaders through their instrument of aggression, the Warsaw Treaty. There have been signs of intense activity this year, at the instigation of the two Powers. In accordance with their strategy to consolidate and subsequently extend their domination in Europe and carrying out their aggressive plans in other areas, United States and Soviet imperialists are particularly concerned with ensuring the success of that project. The Soviet revisionists in particular are showing special haste, which can be explained by their internal difficulties, the ever growing resistance of the countries of Eastern Europe to their policy of intervention and domination, by their plans and preparations for aggression directed towards Asia against the People's Republic of China. Of course the United States and its West em allies, particularly the Federal Republic of Germany, have not failed to do everything in their power to exploit this haste displayed by the Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to obtain the largest possible number of concessions on the German problem and that of West Berlin, as well as to ensure their economic, political and cultural penetration into the countries of Eastern Europe.
67.	Confronted by the insurmountable difficulties relating to the contradictions existing on many problems between the United States imperialists and the Soviet social imperialists as well as between them and the other European States, the two so called superPowers, in order to find a way out and mislead public opinion, have hit on the following formula to serve as a guiding principle for any agreement to be concluded in this framework: 'renunciation of the use of force in relations among the States of Europe'. That misleading formula is designed in fact to give them something to cling to as they conclude these agreements. It was on the basis of that formula that the negotiations took place between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and Poland, as well as the long negotiations, of paramount importance, between the Soviet Union and West Germany.
68.	In all those activities the step which has had the greatest impact is the SovietWest German Treaty signed on 12 August last in Moscow. Intense propaganda attended the signing of that Treaty which was designed to present it as a historic event that would so they said bring peace to Europe and the integrity of its borders. Of course, such a campaign, regardless of the means used, could deceive only the naive. The peoples of Europe, who have had great experience, cannot be taken in by empty rhetoric. In particular, the propaganda statements of the Soviet and American leaders, and their supporters, cannot fail to recall the vast deceitful campaigns which accompanied the various stages of the plotting and compromises of the Western Powers with Hitlerian militarism, especially as regards the Munich Agreement of September 1938.
69.	The Moscow Treaty is in fact no solution to the German problem. Indeed it is an open violation of the decisions on that problem adopted by the Allied Powers during the war, and of the oft renewed promises of the Soviet revisionist leadership to conclude a peace treaty with the two German States, or simply with the German Democratic Republic, and to defend the interests and sovereign rights of the latter. The Soviet revisionists have trampled under foot their commitments and their obligations, and thus committed a serious crime against the German people, against the German Democratic Republic, against peace and security in Europe and in the entire world. They have therefore assumed a heavy responsibility.
70.	The Moscow Treaty is in fact formal recognition of the entry of conquered Germany into the community of States, without their having signed a peace treaty. In the SovietGerman Treaty, apart from a few equivocal and questionable terms, there is no reference to recognition of borders between the two German States and the OderNeisse line dividing Poland and the German Democratic Republic as final and unchangeable borders; nor is there recognition by the Federal Republic of Germany of the German Democratic Republic as an independent, sovereign State fully enjoying all international rights. Even more important, the Chancellor of West Germany and the other leaders in Bonn have stated on more than one occasion, both before and after the signing of the Treaty, that they will never give up the idea of the reunification of the German nation, which to them means annexation of the German Democratic Republic. That position is again confirmed in the documents annexed to the Treaty. The Bonn Government thus is endeavoring to make the most out of this situation and to gain time in order to prepare to attain its; expansionist objectives in the most favorable circumstances. Thus, the Soviet revisionists have considered and used the German Democratic Republic as a bargaining counter in their dealings with the revengeseekers in Bonn, who still claim they have the right to speak and act on behalf of all of Germany, and there they are supported by the great Western Powers.
71.	As for the provisions of the Treaty concerning the renunciation of the use of force or the inviolability of borders, not only does this not mean that the borders are in fact unchangeable, but the people of Europe know full well the value of such commitments on the part of the German revenge-seekers, for the memory of Hitler's nonaggression pacts with European States is still very fresh in their minds.
72.	Therefore, from all points of view, the Moscow Treaty undeniably provides Bonn's leaders with something to fall back on. It encourages their expansionist and revenge-seeking plans and is at the same time a serious blow to the German Democratic Republic and all progressive peace-loving forces in Germany.
73.	No one can deny that 'He creation of the German Democratic Republic was a great victory not only for the German people but for all the peoples of Europe, or that it is closely connected with peace and security in Europe. The strengthening of the German Democratic Republic and its recognition by all the States of Europe, on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality, are in the interest of their security, and are an essential condition for the settlement of the German problem and a sound basis for any sincere attempt to place the German people on the road to peace and democracy, cooperation, and friendship with all other European peoples. The agreement between the Soviet Union and West Germany is a dangerous step in the opposite direction. It cannot fail to be condemned ,by all peace and freedom-loving countries and peoples in Europe.
74.	It is obvious that the Moscow Treaty is first and foremost the result of bargaining between United States and Soviet imperialists, within the framework of the plans for their global strategy in Europe and other continents. But that Treaty is at the same time an agreement between two new imperialist Powers, Soviet social imperialism and West German militarism, and, as such, it is a serious threat not only to the European continent but also to other areas of the world which are the object of United StatesSoviet plans of aggression. Thus the leaders in Moscow have joined successive Governments in Washington in raising West Germany to the level of a main shock force, a principal partner of the two Powers in putting into effect their counterrevolutionary plans and their plans to subjugate all freedom-loving peoples and countries. How can we fail on this occasion to remind the Assembly that similar plans were part of the policy of the Western Powers toward Hitler's Germany; but that proved very costly to them, for Hitler's Germany eventually turned on them.
75.	The MoscowBonn Treaty is undeniably a new link in the series of plots between the Soviets and the Americans against the world's peoples, and the serious threat entailed in this cannot escape the attention of any Government which is sincerely concerned with the vital interests of its people, national security and independence and world peace.
76.	The Albanian Government has always been in sympathy with the justified concern of the European States which are sincerely interested in security and peace in Europe and in the search for appropriate ways and means to normalize the situation in that continent, to deliver it from the hegemony of the two major imperialist Powers and to reject the idea of spheres of influence, to eliminate the two aggressive blocs dominated by them, and to create favorable circumstances for the development of European cooperation on the basis of respect for independence and national sovereignty, sovereign equality and mutual benefit.
That is fully in line with the principles underlying our foreign policy. But, as all these States know full well, such noble objectives have nothing in common with the criminal plans of the United States and Soviet imperialists and their supporters. In all their activities, in all the pacts which they propose to conclude, in all their initiatives or proposals, including those on 'European security', 'collective security in Asia', or 'international security' presented once again, on the initiative of the Soviet revisionists, to the present session of the General Assembly the two Powers are constantly motivated by their insatiable greed to dominate and exploit the peoples of the world, by their desire to maintain and consolidate their spheres of influence in Europe and elsewhere and to have a free hand in those areas, to ensure tranquility to their rear the better to carry out all their various expansionist plans in Asia, Africa and elsewhere, using whatever means are necessary, even to the extent of threatening or using armed force.
77.	There is really no need to prove that this is the true state of affairs. It is amply borne out by all international realities and by the hotbeds of imperialist war in many areas of the world aggression in Indo-China, the Middle East, the Far East, Europe and elsewhere; the military bases of the United States and Soviet imperialists in Europe and other continents; their occupation of foreign territories; nuclear blackmail; the arms race; their fleets of warships v/hich cruise in the Mediterranean, the Pacific and other seas and oceans and threaten peace-loving peoples and countries in those areas. It is all borne out, inter alia, by their criminal plans in Europe, where a particular role is assigned by them to revenge-seeking Germany, their plans for Asia aimed particularly at the encirclement of the People's Republic of China and at preparation for war against that country with the cooperation of other aggressive Powers, in particular Japanese militarism. How can one claim to guarantee peace in Europe in such conditions under the aegis and protection of the two imperialist Powers, American and Soviet?
78.	One wonders against whom peace has to be guaranteed. Who is threatening the peace and security of the peoples of Europe? Can it be those of us from small, peace-loving countries? In our opinion, to be caught in such SovietAmerican traps as 'European security' or 'collective security in Asia' is tantamount to serving their aggressive plans or, rather, to throwing oneself to the wolves. Today more than ever before peace is indivisible, and we cannot have peace in Europe and war in Asia and elsewhere.
79.	Comrade Enver Hoxha, in his statement on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the liberation of Albania, stated in this connexion:
'First, the question is who should be assured and by whom. The 'European security' which is sought by the Soviet revisionists and supported by the United States imperialists means security for their spheres of influence in Europe, security for their military bases and the right for their squadrons to patrol European coasts. This means that the peoples of Europe must legally and officially recognize the right of Moscow and Washington to conserve the special privileges of an imperialist and colonialist nature which they have in various countries of Europe. Such security boils down to the permanent maintenance in Europe of the status quo of Soviet American domination, to having calm ensured on that continent so that the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists have some freedom of movement and act freely in Asia, Africa and everywhere else in order to subjugate and enslave peoples, to reinforce their capitalistic system of exploitation, both at home and in their empires.'
80.	We believe that international peace and security can be assured only by a resolute opposition and struggle against the two imperialist Powers, against their policy of diktat, aggression and war. Any other way would only be grist to the mill of those two Powers, which envisage the enslavement of Europe and the world.
81.	We are convinced that no matter what efforts are made by the American and Soviet imperialists and their collaborators, they will never have the tranquility they seek in Europe. They will run more and more into their own contradictions, and the peoples of Europe will not accept their hegemony in any guise. They will never allow them to pit Europe against Asia, and they will never allow themselves to be cannon fodder for the realization of the criminal plans of the two Powers.
82.	We are well aware that peace-loving Member States condemn the aggressive policies of the two imperialist Powers, their collusion at the expense of the cause of peace-loving peoples and countries, their monstrous plans to redivide and dominate the world. We have constantly admired the courageous and just struggle being waged by many countries, here in the United Nations and outside it, against this grand conspiracy of the two Powers. But the present international situation requires of all Member States faithful to the principles of the independence and equality of States great and small and respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity that they intensify their struggle still further and unite their efforts against AmericanSoviet imperialism and collusion and their desire to impose their diktat here. That is in the higher interests of international peace and security, which are seriously threatened by the aggressive policy of the American Soviet coalition. That is what is required for the lofty interests of the peoples who are fighting against imperialism, colonialism and reaction.
83.	Many States have fought unceasingly to do away with the unprecedented anomaly which exists in this Organization as a result of the violation of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China and the usurpation of its place here by a clique of renegades in the service of American imperialism. Nevertheless, that scandalous and intolerable situation continues today because of the hostile and aggressive policy of the United States against great socialist China and its manipulation of the United Nations.
84.	At this session Albania and fourteen other countries have once again place on the Assembly's agenda the question of restoring the lawful rights of the Peoples's Republic of China in the United Nations [A/8043 and Add.I and 2]. We have done so not only because there is a flagrant and gross violation of the Charter, which affects the sovereign rights of a founding Member State of the United Nations and permanent member of the Security Council, but also because the elimination of this abnormal, unprecedented situation is an urgent necessity for the United Nations if it is desired to take steps towards its recovery and to put it in a position to accomplish its tasks under the Charter. It is quite clear that without the People's Republic of China, given its authority, its great international role and its tremendous potential, this Organization cannot be in a position to make an effective contribution to the settlement of the important problems of our time.
85.	The People's Republic of China is a great and powerful socialist State that has had tremendous success in all areas and enjoys incomparable international prestige and authority. The dazzling victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution which thwarted the plots of the imperialists and revisionists and took control inside the Chinese citadel is a living testimony of the invincible force of the great Chinese people and guaranteed the great role which powerful socialist China now undeniably plays in the destinies of the peoples of the world.
86.	The People's Republic of China has become today a great and impregnable fortress in the liberation struggle of the peoples against imperialism, colonialism and reaction. It is the unshakable rampart of all progressive mankind.
87.	We consider that the position taken by the General Assembly on this question will prove its determination both to reject the diktat which the two great imperialist Powers seek lo exercise in the United Nations and to embark on a course in conformity with the aspirations of the peoples and the fundamental provisions of the Charter. We express the hope that the Governments of peace-loving States which constitute the xnajority here, aware of the serious situation in the United Nations, will have the courage to adopt the attitudes dictated by their convictions and the true interests of their countries and of the Organization itself.
88.	The People's Republic of Albania has constantly pursued an independent revolutionary foreign policy in accordance with the higher interests of the building and defense of our socialist homeland as well as those of the great cause of the peoples who are fighting for their freedom, their independence and their sacred right freely to determine their own future,
89.	The Albanian people have been able to defend their socialist homeland in every circumstance against all plots, threats and provocations of imperialists and revisionists. It is ever watchful and prepared at any moment to respond to anyone who dares to raise a hand against it.
16
90.	The Albanian people, its party and its Government, have supported and will continue strongly to support the legitimate struggle of peace-loving peoples and countries against the aggressive policy of the two imperialist Powers, their colonialist collaborators and their lackeys of all kinds. We have always stood by and shall always stand by the brother peoples of VietNam, Laos, Cambodia and the other peoples of Indo-China and Asia in their heroic struggle against the American aggressors and their allies of all kinds. We have supported and we shall continue unreservedly to support the legitimate fight of the fraternal Arab peoples against the Zionist aggressors and American and Soviet imperialists, who are mainly responsible for the present situation in the Middle East. We have vigorously supported the struggle of the peoples of European countries the peoples of Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic and the other peoples of that continent as well as the peoples of other continents against the policy of domination, oppression and exploitation of the two imperialist Powers and against their counterrevolutionary 'holy alliance'.
91.	We are firmly convinced that the peoples of the entire world, who are fighting for a just cause on the vast anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist front, in ever more resolute combat solidarity, will put down all plots, aggressive plans and aggressions, no matter who may be responsible for them, and will win their final victory over their common enemies.
92.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Albania, at this session of the General Assembly, guided by the MarxistLeninist principles of our Socialist State, will continue, as in the past, together with other freedom-loving peoples to make its modest contribution to the cause of freedom, independence and genuine cooperation in friendship among all the people of th* world.




"
25,1970,BEL,"176. No doubt each of us, before coming up to this rostrum, wonders about the usefulness or futility of the speech. Must we still speak when our voices are drowned out by the mournful cries of so many victims of the world's disorders? Our reply is yes, provided that, in listening to each other, we become more deeply convinced of our responsibilities. For our part, we shall not extol the successes of the United Nations, nor shall we allow ourselves to be discouraged by its failures. A world-wide order of peace and justice cannot be built in 25 years.
177.	Is it not important in itself that our Organization, conceived in a very different moment of history, has withstood the changes wrought by a single quarter- century?
178.	In 1970, no one doubts that the United Nations is necessary. On the contrary, people want it to be effective.
179.	It seems to us that one thing should encourage us all. It is the fact that in our countries, in mine as in may others, the great principles 'of the Charter are impressing themselves more and more on consciences and especially on the consciences of the young. On the one hand we see that in most of our countries many convictions are crumbling, but on the other hand we find stronger support than existed 25 years ago for the five choices made by our States in 1945. Indeed there is, and particularly among the younger members of our population, an immediate response to the duty to organize collective security; the duty to disarm; the duty to ensure the equitable distribution of goods among all peoples; respect for human rights; and the settlement by arbitration or judicial process of legal disputes between States.
180.	All these aims, in our country and in many others, are becoming more and more sacred, imperative and urgent: the failure to observe these principles grows more shocking, and we are therefore urged to hasten the time when these principles and duties will be fulfilled throughout the world.
181.	Our response to this expectation is two-fold; as we see it, the aims of the United Nations must be tackled on all fronts and, whenever possible, at several levels not only by the central institutions of the United Nations, but also by numerous regional actions.
182.	We do not propose the establishment of new institutions, but rather the adaptation and enhancement of those we already have.
183.	First of ail we wish and I am saying first of all to strengthen the central institutions of the United Nations, especially for the purpose of achieving two of their main purposes: security and development.
184.	Whatever contributes towards making the Security Council more effective will have our support. My country was one of the sponsors of the draft resolution on international security, submitted in the First
Committee, which, inter alia, contains specific proposals for strengthening the authority of the Council. But I fully realize that these proposals will not achieve their purpose unless, beforehand, all States Members of our Organization reaffirm their political will to accept and implement the decisions of the Council, in accordance with Article 25 of the Charter.
185.	Furthermore, in specific, limited fields, the Charter delegates to the Security Council real powers, and this, as we see it, foreshadows a world executive in a way. But here, should not the General Assembly support the Council? To that end, we would be in favor of the General Assembly, within the context of Article 12 of the Charter, pronouncing itself on the action of the Security Council, and hence of its closely studying the annual report of the Council.
186.	We also wish to emphasize the importance of the meeting of the Security Council provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 28 of the Charter, which should be held in the course of the work of the present session of the General Assembly. We have strongly supported that action in previous years and now reaffirm our support.
187.	So much for the field of security. The same holds true with regard to development. We believe that the time is coming when a certain power of decision will have to be vested in a world executive. It is no longer sufficient for the Economic and Social Council or the General Assembly simply to set development targets; some poverty will not be avoided unless, in specific cases, some authority can enforce the necessary action in time. For the purpose of restoring peace, does not the Charter confer such powers on the Security Council? And sometimes the Council exercises them. The same need exists where hunger or underdevelopment are involved.
188.	Accordingly, we believe that we are faced with the problem of the exercise of the central authority of the United Nations and of strengthening this Organization.
189.	Of course, the question of strengthening the authority of the United Nations also embraces the ques-tion of its universality. We welcome the fact that in a quarter of a century the sovereignty of so many formerly dependent territories has been recognized and their admission to membership in the United Nations guarantees it. Such is the irreversible trend of decolonization. But the problem of universality presents itself in another way. Some peoples are represented here only in part or not at all. Their absence is not conducive to peace or to peaceful relations between States. The time is not very far off, we believe, when we will be able to adopt an attitude more consistent with our principles. To achieve this, we must overcome the difficulties which still persist, especially with regard to China.
190.	In this particular case, my country has consistently urged, for five years, a solution that would enable the representatives of the Government of the People's
Republic of China a State which we recognize to occupy the seat which belongs to China in the General Assembly and in the Security Council. This solution cannot jeopardize the right of the representatives of the Government of the Republic of Taiwan to continue to enjoy the protection of our Charter, and therefore to participate in the work of the United Nations. This is, we believe, the only possibility, until a peaceful settlement enables the dispute between these two Chinese Governments to be composed. We also believe that the peaceful settlement of that dispute would thereby be facilitated.
191.	My country regrets that a large number of States have informed us that they do not yet share our view, and we therefore did not wish to express it this year in the form of a draft resolution. But, on the other hand, so far, no one has convinced us that any other attitude would be both more just and more consistent with the Charter. We shall continue our consultations with other Governments in seeking the urgent solution which this important problem demands.
192.	We therefore attach the greatest importance to strengthening the central power of the United Nations and to its universality; but we hold it to be equally true that the purposes of the Charter can be successfully achieved, although in part, by means of regional arrangements or organizations, deriving from the spontaneous action of countries grouped together in a given area one action does not exclude the other, one action adding to the other, the one aiding the other.
193.	The idea is hardly revolutionary. It is suggested in many parts of the Charter and it has already been put into effect in part but in our opinion, at this time in history, it deserves further reflection and a new impetus. The reasons for this effort can, we think, be formulated in a few proposals.
194.	Let us make use of this need, which has become evident and is relatively recent: which compels most States to have recourse to inter-State 'organizations in order to solve their economic, social, communications, supply, market, cultural, scientific and defense problems, which today separate nations can as a rule no longer master by themselves.
195.	This necessity for interdependence which is relatively recent, I repeat has created the need today for new regional links of solidarity. These are natural; they are becoming more and more closely knit; each is formed differently by a complex of historical and geographical factors, similarities of human environment, identical needs and aspirations, related political regimes and philosophies. We believe th^t we must make use of this natural movement.
196.	We must therefore imbue these new institutions with the spirit of the Charter and, in each case, examine whether they cannot constitute, in turn, an initial framework which encompasses the purposes of the United Nations and tries to achieve them first in a regional context. Perhaps some obstacles which impede the power of decision of the Security Council might now be offset by this method.
197.	The regional organizations, too, will, of course, remain incomplete and partly prevented from fulfilling their objectives.
198.	But if the purposes of the United Nations are thus pursued from the ground to the top and from top to bottom, if the complementarity of action is ensured and, if, of course, the world bodies still have the last word in the event of conflicting policies, then we can hope for a greater measure of over-all success in pursuing the purposes of the Charter.
199.	Those are the reasons which, in the light of experience, prompt us to co-operate eagerly I am speaking of Belgium in the world organizations and in their decentralized activities and also to participate actively in our region, Europe, in promoting links of regional solidarity and interdependence.
200.	That will provide a better understanding of some of the attitudes adopted by my country with regard to the present items and, first of all, I turn to the problems of security.
201.	The more than 30 States which share the territory of Europe cannot forget that in the past 100 years they have unleashed more wars than the other continents, and that two of them have set the world on fire. As if this were not enough, a cold war has been dividing them for the past quarter of a century. Why has this new situation of conflict not led to a third world war? Because, we believe, very soon and very fortunately bonds of solidarity and interdependence began to create balanced situations: certain transnational groupings in Europe which, due to the cohesion they have acquired and that will be developed further, make possible today the efforts gradually to reduce tensions and then to foster understanding.
202.	We have therefore asked ourselves whether, some day, security arrangements of the kind provided for in Article 52 of the Charter might bring about and guarantee harmony in the territories of the whole of Europe through the establishment of rules and instruments of agreement, conciliation and arbitration of disputes. Here it must be made quite clear that such arrangements can be no substitute for our existing economic solidarity and I am referring to the European Economic Communities or for the existing defense organizations that is, the Atlantic Alliance but they should supplement them. Similarly, if a security agreement for the whole of Europe were to be concluded some day, nor would it replace the task of the Security Council, but would remain subordinated to it through the links provided for in Article 54 of the Charter.
203.	Finally, let us say it, a regional organization for the security of the whole of Europe cannot be achieved so long as there is no political agreement on Berlin, no rules accepted by all on the real equality of States, and so long as the principle of non-interference in the affairs of others is not upheld in practice. Events of only too recent memory show that transitional steps are necessary to temper power politics by establishing collective security. It is therefore necessary, in our opinion, to seek to have such regional security agreements for Europe, not as an immediately obtainable objective, but as an ultimate end to be reached only step by step.
204.	It is on the road to European regional security that the time is coming when efforts must be made to endeavor to achieve the first intermediate objectives which would in themselves have far-reaching implications. Let the bilateral agreements on economic and social co-operation between countries with different systems become multilateral; let us seek to have the covenants renouncing the use of force, such as the one recently signed by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, apply to Europe as a whole.
205.	But for such intermediary agreements to be really credible, the negotiations themselves should at the same time make it possible to establish at least the principles and general outlines of a gradual and parallel reduction in regional armaments in Europe, both those stationed there and national armaments. And that leads us to the second problem: disarmament.
206.	What purpose does it really serve to declare sol-emnly that we renounce the use of force, if we continue to pile up the instruments of force? It follows that the renunciation of force and the reduction of armaments are two indivisible elements.
207.	Certainly the problem of disarmament has already been raised at the world level, but since we want the coming decade to be that of disarmament, it would be worth while to pursue this aim at several levels: the negotiations of the 25 at Geneva have borne some fruit; the bilateral so-called SALT negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union do not seem to be ineffective.
208.	But what can and should Europe do, Europe which harbors so many tactical and conventional means of destruction? Should it take regional steps to disarm? For a long time now Belgium has strongly believed that it should, and is prepared to participate in such negotiations, in which the United States and Canada would of necessity have to be parties too. We hope that such negotiations will be possible as soon as the practical and well-known conditions for the ratification in Bonn of the German-Soviet Treaty have been met, and provided nothing else transpires to darken this horizon. Then the active preparation of initial conferences on European security could be organized. We will contribute, as in the past, to this first approach to regional security.
209.	The second area in which central and regional actions can be combined without being merged, but complement each other, is development.
210.	We have spoken about the Disarmament Decade. It will also be the Development Decade. The two are not unrelated. The strategy for the Second Development Decade has already been discussed at length and formulated, and in this context the volume and terms of the financial aid for development are particularly noteworthy.
211.	That is why Belgium is happy to be able to announce that its total aid will exceed 1 per cent of its gross national product in 1970, as in previous years. Moreover, it wishes to stress that its public aid rose 10 per cent in 1968, and 12 per cent in 1969, which placed it fourth among the industrialized countries. This public aid will further increase in 1971, by 18 per cent.
212.	Lastly, and above all, the Belgian Government, mindful of the needs and hopes of the developing countries, decided on 24 September 1970, a few days ago, to place before Parliament a Program under which public aid would in 1975 reach the figure of 0.70 per cent of that year's gross national product. This decision is a milestone in our policy, but its scope will be very limited unless it forms part of a joint effort by the industrialized countries.
213.	As we know very well, a common effort should not be focused only on the financing of development. It should encompass trade policy, a commodities price policy and support for the developing country's own efforts in all areas, especially that of regional cooperation and integration. This will in all likelihood require revision and adaptation of the process of world discussion.
214.	We believe furthermore that here again regional initiatives can, through individual arrangements with certain developing countries, add a dimension and a form of particularly effective mutual co-operation. I am thinking of the European communities which, through the Yaounde Convention  and the Arusha Declaration of January 1970 and through aid to associated European countries, make a contribution which, in some fields, supplements and increases the effects of bilateral assistance.
215.	As regards Latin America, we view with sympathy the efforts at progressive integration of the States of that part of the world, and we particularly welcome the spirit which, at the last meeting of the Special Commission for Latin American co-ordination in July, motivated the Buenos Aires Declaration on the problems of relations with the European Economic Communities.
216.	In turn Belgium hopes that the European Com- munites, as they develop and expand, will be able to give Western Europe a new image. It will not be one of hegemony, it cannot be one of neutrality, it will not be one of dependency. What, then, would be the attitude of Europe, in the process of unification, to the world? None other than one of intensive cooperation in the development of the southern hemisphere.
217.	Today we must make provision for the economic and social restoration and rehabilitation of the regions affected by the conflict in the Middle East. In that particular case my country is well aware that no real solution will be forthcoming as long as the Palestinian refugees have no home nor the economic means for their development.
218.	Belgium announces that it will participate in any European plan for rehabilitating the devastated areas which will enable those refugees to settle in a stable and happy environment. We have submitted to the European agencies the plan drawn up for this purpose by a Committee headed by the President of the Belgian Senate. Once formulated, a Program of European co-operation would help the parties to the conflict in their search for peace.
219.	On a more immediate and completely bilateral level, in swift response to the moving appeal of our President and of the Secretary-General, the Belgian Government immediately decided, a few days ago, to make a very substantial contribution in aid for the many victims of the recent events in Jordan.
220.	More generally, I cannot speak of the conflict in the Middle East without once again reaffirming the Belgian Government's whole-hearted support for all diplomatic efforts aimed at ensuring the swift and full implementation of the Security Council's resolution of 22 November 1967[242 (1967)]. Unfortunately, three years have already gone by since the essential conditions for a political settlement of the Middle East question were laid down. We venture to hope that both the spirit and the letter of the cease-fire agreement of 12 August last, which we welcomed as a happy event, will be respected by the parties concerned. We are anxious to see the early resumption of the talks initiated by Ambassador Jarring.
221.	We have just dealt with subjects of collective security, disarmament and co-operation for development, and we noted that the convergence of actions at the world level and of regional initiatives could bring closer the time when the purposes of our Charter will be more effectively fulfilled.
222.	Similar thoughts come to mind too in connexion with human rights, economic and social co-operation and international justice.
223.	True, when we speak about the protection of the human person, it would be impossible to guarantee safety from certain evil practices only through international agreements or regulations, and I have in mind here particularly the present crimes of hijacking and the detention or execution of diplomats. In regard to the former, my country will put forward its suggestions at the diplomatic conference to be held in December at The Hague and, for the international protection of diplomats, consuls and ministers, it advocates the urgent convening of an ad hoc diplomatic conference.
224.	But when we envisage a more general approach to the question of respect for human rights, here again we find an example of cases where regional action can supplement that of our General Assembly. We recall that in 1948 we drew up here, for the whole world, a Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
225.	But we can go further in the definition and protection of human rights when regional communities of States allow themselves to be motivated by a stable democratic conscience which is expressed therein. Eighteen European countries did so in 1950, by drawing up the European Charter of Human Rights  and, in addition, by setting up a European court on human rights to which individuals can have recourse when their rights are challenged. Several States, including Belgium, in the past already felt it an honor to amend their national legislation at the request of the Court to bring it into line with the decisions of that Court.
226.	The same will apply to economic and social co-operation, The United Nations already has instruments of regional co-operation. It is in the regional economic commissions that the ideas of integration were born, which took shape in Latin America and are striving to emerge in Africa. It was on their initiative that development banks were founded; it was they who launched numerous projects in the most varied fields from industry to agriculture, and from natural resources to transportation.
227.	Nevertheless, we would like those commissions henceforth to play an even greater role, so as to achieve the goals of the Second Development Decade, especially in the formulation of plans and the evaluation of progress.
228.	As far as the Economic Commission for Europe is concerned, it already plays a leading role in coordinating the efforts made 'with a view to improving good-neighborly relations among European States' as we read in resolution 2129 (XX). In this context or elsewhere, we think that in Europe the time has come to embark on a frank and thorough review of relations between the groupings of the market- economy countries and the State-economy countries.
229.	The last subject in regard to central action and regional action is that of international justice. Indeed, in that field we also see that in some cases regional initiative or action are possible: that is described in Article 33 of the Charter which advocates the settlement of disputes between States by way of good offices, mediation, conciliation and arbitration. That Article provides that those actions can be carried out by regional agencies. The Organization of African Unity has established this type of machinery under the Charter, and we believe this to be a good thing.
230.	True, the International Court of Justice * the supreme tribunal in legal disputes and must, in the final analysis, guarantee the universality of international law. However, here again we cannot forget that States parties to regional legal disputes may, by virtue of the Statutes of the Court itself, Article 26, paragraph 2, ask that chambers be formed for dealing with a particular case. For such cases, and if the question of reactivating the International Court of Justice is looked into further, as requested by the United States, Belgium will submit to it the question whether, in particular cases and on very precisely determined occasions, regional ad hoc chambers could be formed, while at the same time upholding the universal character of the United Nations and the universality of international law.
231.	My country has not been developing an abstract thesis today nor has it claimed that regional initiatives are some kind of panacea for the world. We are merely convinced that the spirit of the Charter can and must manifest itself in many places, and that we must not expect everything from initiatives at the world level; nor of course can we expect everything from regional initiatives; however, if they supplement one another, we may find herein a source of progress or initiatives which are being taken in different places.
232.	We have noted that the past 25 years especially in Europe but also in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East have been characterized by the emergence of numerous regional bodies and firm multilateral ties. To be sound and lasting, these must always be spontaneous and leave each people free to be associated with them; to be excellent, they must draw their inspiration from the principles of the Charter and seek, within that context also, to further their progress. By adding that dimension to our efforts, we have noted, it is possible to increase the opportunities for collective security, disarmament, co-operation for development, respect for human rights, economic and social understanding and international justice.
233.	Allow me, Mr. President, to ask you to convey to Mr. Hambro the tribute which my country wishes to extend to him. My delegation is extremely gratified to see the eminent representative of Norway presiding over our deliberations. Norway and Belgium already participate in many enterprises which I earlier called intermediate. Several Western and European ties of solidarity already bind us, and you know how happy we should be if the accession of Norway to the European Communities were to bring us even closer together. We congratulate the President for having brought to the highest office of the United Nations not only the virtues of his people, but also his own personal qualities of erudition, experience and authority.
234.	I would not wish to conclude without expressing again our great regard for the Secretary-General of our Organization which, on behalf of my country, I have already had the honor to convey many times before from this rostrum. I wish to end my statement by once again assuring him of our highest esteem.
"
25,1970,VEN,"




 Mr. President, on behalf of my Government may I convey to you our sincerest congratulations on the honor which has been conferred upon you by your being elected President of this General Assembly. Your personal qualities, your experience and your important contribution to the study of the United Nations Charter assure us that we will enjoy effective and fruitful guidance of our work during the course of this session.
87.	I should also like to pay tribute to the admirable work accomplished at the past General Assembly session by your distinguished predecessor, Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph.
88.	In this general debate we shall refrain from stating our position in detail on all the specific items on the agenda. Our delegation will state its views on all these items when they come up for debate.
89.	Men, in their desire not to forget the past, have performed acts to mark great moments in history. So it is that we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations at this session. There have been twenty-five years of efforts to maintain international peace and security, to promote friendship among peoples, to co-operate in the solution of the various problems before them and to serve as a center to help achieve these goals. During these twenty-five years man's weaknesses have at times led to the shipwreck of fine ideals, but at the same time heroic virtues and a feeling of human solidarity have asserted themselves on many occasions.
90.	As this long journey draws to a close it is only fitting that we pause and carry out a critical analysis of the results achieved. We must have a critical turn of mind as we endeavor to make the proper judgment. We believe that our primary goal can only be the one which led to the creation of this international Organization, namely, the maintenance of international peace and security.
91.	It is obvious that many positive results have been achieved by the United Nations in the economic, social, cultural, legal and health fields. However, we feel that it is necessary not to disregard the negative aspects of the situation confronting us today. We must concentrate on them if we wish to correct the errors which we have committed in the past. In our opinion the United Nations continues to be the best instrument of the international community in its search for peace and justice in the world. But let us have no illusions, the existing international order shows many serious shortcomings which must be squarely faced.
92.	It would be impossible to take up each and every one of the specific features of today's world. It is only feasible to take stock of the more relevant events which in our opinion determine the march of mankind at this moment of singular importance.
93.	There is a great gap between the principles pro-claimed as the basis of international relations and their concrete application. The important leaders of the major countries of the world assert in their speeches rules for international behavior which are admirable for their beauty and content. However, all too frequently they are mere theoretical expressions, for these rules have not been made a reality in relations among States.
94.	Equality among nations is, to be sure, enshrined in texts. In reality, however, the 'e is only token recognition reflected in a mere right to speak and vote in international organizations.
95.	International order as we know it is based on the preponderance of the major Powers, and peace is solely the result of a policy of balance of power among them. This fact is brought out very clearly in the tendency of the major Powers to disregard the United Nations when considering the principal international problems. The most important political issues are aired and in fact solved without the participation of the developing nations.
96.	There are very great economic and social differences dividing the peoples of the world. Statistics show that the absolute and relative difference between the industrial and backward States is growing every year; this imbalance grows in fact daily. Wealth and progress continue to exist solely in the same States.
97.	It might be thought that as a result of scientific and technological progress the under-developed countries could in fact develop, but this would be a mere illusion. Scientific and technological development will be, in the normal course of events, beyond the reach of the developing countries, or at least their development will not be such as to overcome their backwardness. No matter how one looks at it, the lack of three fundamental elements for development  capital, educational level and technology, which are indissolubly related creates a vicious circle of poverty.
98.	These economic and social differences lead to domination of the under-developed countries by the developed countries as a result of the so-called assistance they provide. We made this point in our statement in the general debate in this Assembly last year. We said:
'The policy of blocs and the division of world power between the two great Powers has introduced deep-rooted evils in international assistance.
'Under one system, economic domination of necessity leads to political and cultural penetration. Under the other system, political and ideological domination implies equally economic control and exploitation. Both systems result in terms of different emphasis and methods in what can only be described as an objective position of subjugation.' [1779th meeting, paras. 85 and 86].
99.	The profit motive on the one hand and the desire for ideological penetration on the other have, in international systems, existed to the detriment of many countries which need the co-operation of the major countries of the world.
100.	Hunger continues to be a scourge for two thirds of mankind. In spite of all the efforts and programs being pursued hunger continues to prevail in enormous areas of the world. Thousands and thousands of men are still literally starving to death every day.
101.	This fact points to just one more ii\justice which divides the peoples of the world today into a club of wealthy nations, an exclusive club with closed doors, and poor nations.
102.	We have already spoken of an international order based on the balance of power between the various blocs. The maintenance of this balance, precarious at best, requires the investment of gigantic sums of money for the acquisition of attack and defense systems which are increasingly complex and costly. The possession of the atomic bomb has been the point of departure in a constant arms race designed to end the balance of terror by some decisive discovery or by establishing the kind of material superiority which Would have an unquestionable effect.
103.	With a very small percentage of the investments that are made for destruction, the face of the earth could indeed be changed. However, the struggle for control of the world makes it impossible for the competitors to act in everyone's best interests.
104.	Thus, at a time when man has made the most sensational discoveries, at the international level we must witness enormous efforts to achieve superiority in weaponry while at the same time more than two thirds of mankind remain victims of underdevelopment.
105.	We have seen how precarious the peace has been over the past twenty-five years. Armed conflicts have indeed not come to an end and the blood of the dead and the wounded has been shed in the remotest areas of the earth. We have grown accustomed to all this. We are not even so worried any more about living on the brink of disaster. And I say 'the brink of disaster' because in a situation where there is a balance of power, events cannot always be controlled and indeed may take us unawares and lead us to a catastrophe.
106.	According to the ordinary approach to history, by war we mean a way of resolving differences among States when diplomatic action fails. But when mankind discovered the atomic bomb the feeling was that war would no longer exist due to the deterrent nature of nuclear weapons.
107.	But a new phenomenon has emerged: war in peace. This paradox has a name: a system of permanent subversion. No nation can escape this fact. Both the developed and undeveloped, all may be victims of this evil. Subversion may exist at any point of tension or antagonism, wherever it may exist.
108.	In addition to subversion carefully developed into a system, we find at the international level, the cult of violence. Let me define my terms very clearly. In ordinary language violence is often confused with force. But this is an error. Force is the body of all means and procedures used by law for the enforcement of law. On the other hand, violence signifies the illegal use of force meaning the indiscriminate use of force not in accordance with pre-established principles.
109.	A new fact about today's world then is this cult of violence; what it amounts to is the consecration of the use of indiscriminate force for whatever purposes are being pursued. Violence is an end in itself. Those who support this new religion of violence proclaim that they will not stop at any crime in order to put an end to injustice. They forget that violence can only lead to further acts of injustice, and if these acts are pursued nothing can be changed on the surface of the earth, for, qualitatively speaking, we would all be living at the same level of injustice.
110.	In this way the consequences of violence now strike individuals who had nothing to do with the drama being played out around them. As a corollary of fanaticism and divinely sponsored aggression, there has been a whole host of crimes of all kinds: kidnappings, assassinations, hijackings, attacks, and so forth. All these acts occur at the expense of innocent human beings, as a way of committing acts of violence against others who are thought to be guilty. In this way mankind has gone back to a time which we thought was permanently in the past. We have released instincts which lead to the explosion of passions, which are characterized by special interests or fanaticism.
111.	'	What we have said, of course, does not exclude the right of peoples to rebel against tyranny, colonialism, racism, or any other form of oppression. In this case, of course, it is the oppressors who practice violence; and the right to rebellion, legitimately exercised, represents the people's striving to restore juridical order.
112.	Together with all these things, there is a growing process of lowering of Individuality and the arrival of the mass phenomenon. Progressive depersonalization is taking place. There is a loss of a feeling of the human person understood as a rational free being, which is now being replaced by that of the interchangeable man, the individual in the mass.
113.	Critical judgment has been replaced by the emotional reaction, and rational life by the life of feeling. In the disappearance of the critical judgment, man has lost his true status as a human being and his fundamental characteristic reason. The man of today remains in this way at the mercy of those who are able systematically to use the levers of the sub-conscience and of instinct.
114.	This picture of the growing advent of mass phenomena is completed with a picture of very con-siderable mental confusion. Societies see collapsing around them, apparently or really, the scale of values which support them. The phenomenon affects mankind as a whole. There is no country in the world which has not seen challenged all the principles on which we have lived so far. This confusion about values applies to the international sphere*too. Norms which have governed relations between peoples since time immemorial are now at a critical stage. It is not a question of violation of these norms. Violations or infractions of rules have always existed in mankind. The infraction, to some extent, ratified the true nature of the norm. But this is something different. What we are talking about is a contempt for rules, a disregard for their ethical content. An obvious example can be found in the acts of kidnapping and aerial hijacking which have occurred in recent months.
115.	This is a disturbing picture. We believe that it affects the historical reality that we are experiencing now. It dispels all of our illusions and compels us to act. It also makes it possible to understand that fate condemns us if we do not act.
116.	But, also, we must ask ourselves: why have so many efforts to produce peace given such results? Why have we confused the avoidance of war with the quest for peace? To understand this, the best way to proceed is to examine the manner in which the United Nations came into existence.
117.	The United Nations Charter has an original sin. The United Nations was born of a war and tried to end war in general. The victorious parties in the last world war imposed their peace. However, there is no such thing as an imposed peace. Peace, to be authentic, has to be shared.
118.	The United Nations, born of the historic trauma of war has not been able to go beyond that first anxiety of preserving men from the scourge of war. In this respect we could go so far as to say that all that has really been avoided is world war. As such, the phenomenon of war has been a permanent reality even though it has been confined to certain different regions of the earth.
119.	But peace cannot simply be reduced to a mere absence of wars. The absence of armed conflict is only the negative aspect of peace, not its true essence. This leads us, then, to ask ourselves what are the conditions necessary for real peace among nations.
120.	The first condition is real equality among national communities. For this purpose a radical change is required, a change which will involve the thoroughgoing alteration of existing structures.
121.	No country on earth, however powerful or developed, has more dignity than any other. Each people has its own personality and specific ways of living that deserve respect. We must accept ourselves as we are, with both our good qualities and our short-comings.
122.	Frank and sincere dialog must start between nations as the best way to bring about mutual under-standing. Reciprocal respect between national communities, which is a prime condition for peace, excludes relations based on domination and subjection between developed and developing countries, and even also among the industrialized States themselves. What is needed is real participation, more social and more democratic, by the community of peoples. Moreover, in order to lie authentic, peace must be shared in both the obligations and rights it involves. In this way, also, international authority will not be regarded as an instrument for world domination. Equality and dignity among States lastly presupposes the elimination of racism as a source of discrimination between States.
123.	The second condition for the establishment of peace among nations is the ordering of relations between peoples along the lines of international social justice.
124.	At this point I would echo the words of my Head of State, Dr Rafael Caldera:
'The formula for bringing about happy relation-ships which will take the form of friendship and inter-national co-operation cannot be a fierce struggle to buy more cheaply for ourselves and to sell ourselves at a higher price. The idea that more trade will make aid less necessary is true but only so long as trade becomes fairer and justice for the peoples of the developing countries takes the form of a greater chance to bring about the urgent changes they need. I believe in international social justice. As Aristotle saw it, justice demands that one should give everybody that which is his. As his thought has been developed in Christian philosophy, that which is his as a concept does not apply merely to individual men but also to society for the common good. There is no difficulty at all in applying this concept to the international community.
'Just as society at the national level has a right to impose various relationships upon its members, so the international community requires of the various peoples participation in accordance with their capacity so that everybody may live a human life. The obligations and rights of the various peoples have to be gauged, therefore, according to the capacity and needs of each people, in order to make peace, harmony and progress feasible so that we shall all advance in real friendship.'
125.	Therefore, if we believe that the development of every man and all men is the new name for peace this implies a fundamental shift in the principles which lie behind the present international order. Otherwise our aid programs will establish new forms of colonialism and will reinforce existing injustices, and the gap between the rich and poor countries will widen constantly.
126.	At this point in man's evolution it is impossible to admit that a developed country can impose upon an undeveloped country to which it provides 'aid' a counterpart equal to usually it is greater than the 'value' of the 'service' provided. Under such conditions how will it ever be possible to emerge from under-development? When we spoke before this august Assembly last year we quite rightly said that 'the wealth of the developed countries sinks its roots in the poverty of the developing nations' [J 779th meeting, para. 88].
127.	This means that it is necessary for relations between nations to become ordered in accordance with the principles of international social justice, which leads me to quote again from the words of President Caldera:
'... if we believe that there is an international community, and if we truly maintain that all men, all of us, are part of a great society and that this great society has the right to exist and prosper, it is indispensable that on its behalf appropriate responsibilities and burdens, functions corresponding to the possibilities, strength, level of development and wealth of certain peoples vis-a-vis others should be required of peoples'.
128.	The third condition for peace is the establishment of active solidarity which will truly bind the different peoples of the world together. This solidarity will be dynamic only to the extent that it is directed towards the universal common good, and only if it is based on international social justice.
129.	The profound social, political, economic, cul-tural, scientific and technological changes that have taken place have altered human relations within the various societies, both national and international. The earth is shrinking, and we men are drawn closer to each other. National communities have become aware of their individuality. It is all the time being more clearly understood how the fate of each is bound up with the fate of the rest. Also, admittedly in a confused form but quite visibly, there is emerging the idea of a universal common good over and above the desires of each nation, towards which the interests of mankind should be directed. The solidarity of mankind is no longer a subject for discussion.
130.	But. the barriers to international solidarity must be surmounted. These are two: first, there is the proliferation of overblown nationalism. This nationalism exalts beyond all measure national egoism and creates obstacles to a balanced co-ordination among peoples. Second, there are ideological hatreds which lead to divisions among nations and engender divisive fanatical attitudes which are quite negative and are a rich fertilizer for the appearance and flourishing nature of violence as a system. While there is one part of mankind which considers that the economic and social way of life of another part of mankind is an evil to be destroyed, it will obviously be difficult for real solidarity to prevail; we cannot go beyond mere tolerated coexistence, which is a kind of marking time, or holding war at bay, as it were, simply holding off the destruction of one party by another. Coexistence in this way will 
remain simply a stage in the game of the unstable balance between blocs.
131.	If we want to achieve a shared and non-imposed peace, active solidarity between nations will compel us to embark upon successive processes of integration to get from the sphere of national autarchy towards the creation of a supernational society. This is what we might call the stage of pluralist integration, a more appropriate method than the system of defensive and offensive alliances which is characteristic of bloc politics.
132.	Active solidarity among nations requires of us the elimination of the machinery of political-economic subjection imposed de facto by the developed countries of East and West, to the detriment of the underdeveloped countries.
133.	Active solidarity among nations, lastly, imposes on us an obligation to impart a new ideological concept to the new civilization, to the new international order which is already knocking impatiently at our doors. This new ideology must start from the historic reality that we are living in now and the profound aspirations of peoples. It will be a social and revolutionary humanism founded on the recognition of the unity and indivisibility of the fate of mankind and of the eminent dignity of the human person. Its goal will be the development of the whole man and of all men. It will regard as a fundamental right of each national community active participation in the decisions which concern it in the international order. It will at all times be directed towards the promotion of the universal common good, inspired by an ideal of social international justice.
134.	A durable and lasting peace is to be the goal that it will try to achieve. It will not be an imposed pCaCC, but a voluntary peace, a peace sought for, a peace accepted and shared.
135.	Is this Utopian? I put it to you whether it is not more Utopian to continue on the road that we are on now and to believe that it will take us towards peace and international security.
136.	In examining all these problems we must necessarily think of the heavy burden which our Secretary- General, U Thant, bears on his shoulders.
137.	Our children, the men of tomorrow, will require of us categorically at this twenty-fifth anniversary session of the United Nations that we construct a human and just international order in which peace and freedom of spirit shall reign in the hearts of men. Let us all unite our efforts, so as not to disappoint them.
"
25,1970,COG,"122.	  I cannot begin my intervention without referring to the solemn resounding tribute which our Permanent Representative paid yesterday from this rostrum [1852nd meeting] to the memory of President Nasser whose death made a profound impact on the Congolese people and particularly on President Marien N'Gouabi who was very close to the late President and had for him a feeling of very great personal affection and militant comradeship and also on myself, since I was, for three years, Ambassador of a friendly country to the United Arab Republic and benefited from the kindness of a man who has now joined the select group of the heroes of history.
123.	For three years, day after day, I had a chance to observe the many-faceted work of President Nasser. I particularly noticed his absolutely resolute will to turn Egypt into a powerful country, to build in it an independent economy, to turn the Egyptian fella into a man aware of his own personality, his own value, a respected man. I have admired his unequaled courage, which, like the courage that animated the pharaohs, enabled him to carry out the great Aswan Dam project and to overcome thousands of difficulties.
124.	President Nasser succeeded and he has died at precisely the moment when his people valued him so much, when Africa is partly liberated and when it is engaged in the decisive fight to expel from its land the colonialists and the imperialists.
125.	A citizen of the third world, nonaligned, supporter of liberation movements, panAfrican, pan Arab such was President Nasser to whose memory we now pay solemn tribute.
126.	The People's Republic of the Congo through my voice is happy to join in the chorus of congratulations which are fully deserved and which have been addressed to President Hambro with warm and moving eloquence by the speakers who have spoken before me in the general debate. President Hambro's great moral, and intellectual qualities of exceptional caliber and his talents as diplomat, jurist and statesman have been sufficiently described by the various speakers to remind us that the fate of the twenty-fifth session has been entrusted to a man most qualified to lead our debate towards that ideal to which we all aspire, a real convergence of peoples towards a better understanding and greater cooperation between all races and peoples.
127.	President Hambro is taking over the presidency from Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph who left the imprint of her strong and captivating personality on the twenty- fourth session, giving the nations of the world definitive proof of the serious intention of African women to free themselves from the bonds of the past and to take part fully in the construction of a new world.
128.	But I can feel satisfied that I have really done my duty only when I pay tribute to the courage, lucidity and devotion to the cause of peace of our Secretary General, U Thant.
129.	We have open to us several ways of celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. In any case, it is a chance and a place for all of us to carry out an overall health checkup of the Organization.
130.	Some, intoxicated by technical progress and swept away by hypocrisy which we are used to now  set about this event by indulging in pseudo philosophical discourse which, far from identifying objectively the difficulties which persist unfortunately in the international community, contribute, often by their aphorisms and the facile predetermined vocabulary of deceit, only to making more opaque the mask which conceals the crucial problems of our time and which prevents any durable solution from being achieved.
131.	Others, on the other hand, who find themselves in the front row of this great theater of violence, injustice and exploitation, which can be said to be the true background of our society of today, make it a point of honor to set against that exalted lyricism the harsh law of reality to reveal the truth, certainly without arrogance but without weakness also, in order to draw from it valuable lessons and definite claims based on the spirit and letter of the Charter which so many people here quote from so readily and abundantly.
132.	The celebration of the anniversary of the United Nations provides an excellent opportunity, but unfortunately it is in danger of remaining a mere polite formality unless the purposes and principles of the Charter, above all, are respected, since they govern the direction in which the activities of the Organization should lead. These goals and principles, we must emphasize, are designed to guide the conduct of the Organization and Member States in order to lead to the happy accomplishment of the common objectives those States have set themselves.
133.	In all objectivity I must state that there lies an abyss between these principles and their proper implementation. What do we see every day? The hypocrisy of certain great Powers which day by day move further and further away from the hope expressed in the Charter to see established a peace which will offer all nations the means of living in security within their frontiers, a peace which will provide all men in all countries with an assurance that they will live a normal life free from fear and need. This hypocrisy has cruelly disappointed the young nations of the third world, which had foolishly placed their hopes in the United Nations.
134.	What have the great Powers done in a positive sense to eradicate tyranny, subjection, oppression and intolerance? Let us have the intellectual courage which consists of finding out the truth or admitting it to ourselves when it displeases us, or just simply telling the truth to take note of our defects and deficiencies. Some speakers, from this rostrum, have urged all delegations to engage in self-criticism and to examine their consciences on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization.
135.	Let me say that the revolutionary people of the People's Republic of the Congo is thoroughly devoted to peace. We are convinced that it is in peace and harmony with our neighbors that our people can construct a prosperous, independent economy. That is why we welcome the reconciliation brought about last June between the two sister Republics of the Congo, whose Heads of State, President Marien N'Gouabi and President Joseph Desire Mobutu, on that occasion showed a courage and a sense of responsibility of which Africa can justly be proud. Our two leaders thus showed the world that ideological differences should never constitute permanent reasons for division and tension.
136.	Within our frontiers, the Congolese Labor Party tirelessly pursues the same policy of peace, democracy and justice, involving in the difficult task of national construction all Congolese devoted to the ideals of the revolution without distinction as to ethnic origin or region.
137.	Notwithstanding this fervent desire for peace, every day we are under attack by imperialism, which tries to create agitation and stir up trouble in our midst. The Congolese people, united as one man around their leader and their party, is determined to thwart these criminal moves of imperialism.
138.	As an African, I can only give a very severe opinion of the decolonization mission entrusted to the United Nations by the African peoples. This year which really seems to be the year for negative anniversaries we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. To say that nothing has been done in the ten years that have elapsed since the adoption of the Declaration would be wrong, but in all objectivity we must recognize that results in this field are quite meager. It is difficult for me to understand why a citizen of the Congo is more entitled to freedom than his brother in Angola, Mozambique, Namibia or Guinea (Bissau). Could someone tell me: is there really a proportional distribution of dignity and independence? The colonial and criminal war which Portugal has imposed on the African peoples benefits from the active and undeniable support of certain great Powers, Members of this Organization. With the whole world looking on, the Portuguese colonialists are able to draw on the organic cooperation of NATO, together with the financial and military aid of the capitalist countries which, wearing their cloak of deadly hypocrisy, exploit the credulity of the African countries as they become the bloodstained accomplices of the enemies of our peoples. Sheer calculation and a flair for making deals have guided the hand of imperialism, and the monopolistic capital of exploitation, in its rapacious determination to bring under its control the immense mineral and agricultural wealth of Angola and Mozambique. Alert minds are beginning to grasp this fact. The African peoples now know that those who help the Portuguese colonialists to keep part of Africa under the colonial yoke are, and can only be, the worst enemies of the peoples of our continent.
139.	For ten years we have constantly denounced  with abundant proof the policy of apartheid and the imperialistic aims of the Pretoria Government, which, strengthened by the assurances and substantial aid it constantly obtains from certain Western Powers despite Security Council resolutions, stubbornly persists in its lofty disdain for any international order. It continues to commit foul crimes against the people of Namibia and the other peace-loving peoples of Africa. The minority regime of Salisbury, supported by the racists of Pretoria and the inveterate colonialists, in our opinion constitutes a constant and intolerable challenge to the international community. Can we tell Africa how the great Powers have responded to the Lusaka Manifesto,  which is an appeal to reason and fraternity? The responsibility for the fate of the Zimbabwe people belongs, we declare once more, to the United Kingdom, which, notwithstanding the repeated requests of the African countries, has not been willing to reestablish the right of the majority to manage a country which is really their own.
140.	The common destiny of the African peoples, upon whom the most cruel colonial domination in history was inflicted, dictates to us the sacred duty to support by all possible means the just struggle of the national liberation movements, which will sweep from our continent the consequences and stains of colonialism and imperialism.
141.	I have spoken of Africa, but elsewhere in this world also intolerance and dreams of imperialist domination have kindled flames which are a real threat to peace and security in the world. The crusades undertaken by a great Power, the United States of America, which in the most dubious name of anticommunism, are spreading grief and destruction everywhere, have never been condemned here with the vigor they really deserve.
142.	This attitude of renunciation, this lack of perspicacity and firmness on the part of the Organization make us all supporters of hypocritical compromises. accomplices of the aggressive forces, which, notwithstanding the vigorous resistance constantly put up by the patriotic forces struggling bitterly for national liberation, independence and peace, are far from abandoning their bloody enterprises.
143.	That is why, on this twenty-fifth anniversary, we should not hesitate to denounce any threat to peace.
144.	We must denounce all maneuvers and juridical artifices used by certain Powers to thwart the restoration of the rights of the People's Republic of China as a founding Member of the Organization. That is a duty that the international conscience must face up to. The brave Chinese people has the inalienable right to have in Peking the Government and institutions it chooses. Is it not immensely arrogant to try to have that great people which has made a great contribution to the progress of mankind represented by the Chiang Kaishek clique, which is a kind of Chinese-speaking American Government?
145.	For twenty- years obstacles have been placed in the way of a thorough discussion of the Korean problem, another instance of aggression sustained by the United States of America in Asia. My delegation would once more draw attention to the danger imposed on the peaceful life of the Korean people by the imperialist American Government. How can we fail to experience a feeling of revolt, given the artificial frontier imposed by the aggressor on this culturally rich nation, a nation with traditions going back thousands of years? We would assert that in order to serve the cause of the unification of Korea and serve peace, it is very important and urgent that the American occupation troops which unscrupulously make use of the United Nations flag should withdraw from the south part of Korea; and that, moreover, the United Nations Commission for the so-called reunification and rehabilitation of Korea which is an abject instrument of the American administration should be disbanded and an appeal made without discrimination to the North and South Korean delegations in order to seek a solution to the severe problems of that country.
146.	Is there any need to talk about the fierce aggression of the Washington Government against the VietNamese people, the Cambodian people and other peace-loving peoples of SouthEast Asia, where the United States is setting up the bloodstained puppets devoted to them alone? These barbarous aggressions unfortunately have provoked only the mildest of protests here.
147.	The war of extermination continues in VietNam, notwithstanding the constructive proposals made by the Democratic Republic of VietNam and the National Liberation Front at the Paris Conference, proposals which the United States has clearly never taken into account. The aggressive American forces have invaded Cambodia and wrought terrible destruction there, and no one said a thing about it.
148.	This is how the Organization and the great Powers which lead it intend to set up peace on this earth.
149.	The People's Republic of the Congo fully supports the IndoChinese people's struggle to resist aggression.
150.	The events in the Middle East and their tragic aftermath also bear the mark of the criminal work of imperialism, which now intends to set Asians against Asians, Latin Americans against Latin Americans, Africans against Africans and Arabs against Arabs. We favor peaceful solutions of disputes but as far as concerns the Middle East dispute, the fundamental interests of the Palestinian people must be protected. There will never be a solution to this crisis as long as the Palestinian people, denied their rights, are excluded from any negotiations that may take place.
151.	I will not talk about the failure and this because the pain is too great of the international development strategy which is a kind of enshrining of the supremacy of the developed countries over the Asian, African and Latin American countries; this economic imperialism which constantly threatens our still fragile independence, prompts us to voice doubts once more as to the sincerity and effectiveness of the new United Nations Development Decade. The economic great Powers are themselves the first to recognize that the gap separating them from what are normally called the developing countries is constantly growing wider.
152.	But what they do not say is that they are not prepared to take appropriate measures to cope with the situation which bears within it the seeds of a general revolution and of which we might, I think, with some justification say that such a revolution would not be to the benefit of future generations of the developed nations, because it would be conducted without them and necessarily against them. In our opinion and this is no blackmail at all, because as far as we are concerned President Marien N'Gouabi has always taught us that we should rely on our own strength only the renunciation of national selfishness would make it possible to avoid, or if not to avoid at least to lessen, the inevitably disastrous effects of such a confrontation of interests among States.
153.	Let us hope that this problem will occupy a preeminent place amongst those which it is our duty to examine on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the creation of our Organization.
154.	This gloomy picture, which reflects the widespread discontent and the areas of tension which threaten to throw discord into the message of peace and hope contained in the United Nations Charter, nevertheless need not make us forget that we must all sincerely face the joint weight of our international obligations and help revive the United Nations by our day-by-day conduct, and not just by declarations which are quickly forgotten. We must restrain the arbitrary aims of certain Members and lead everybody to a strict respect for the principles and purposes of the Charter. This is a duty while this session, entrusted to the talents of its President, must not fail to accomplish. Let us never forget that our quality as Member States imposes on us a status of dual nature: if we have rights, we ought not to forget that our duties are of equal magnitude: the duty of obedience to the provisions agreed to in the interests of this Organization, of peace in the world, of friendship and progress among peoples. The People's Republic of the Congo, its President, Commander Marien N'Gouabi, its Party, the Congolese Labor Party, and its Government are ready to subscribe, fully and wholeheartedly, to this program of friendship, solidarity and peace.





"
25,1970,LBY,"110.	  Sir, allow me first to offer on behalf of the delegation of the Liby an Arab Republic and myself, our sincerest congratulations on your election as President of this important historic session. Your election is a recognition of your distinguished qualifications and vast experience. It is also a further indication of the international community's appreciation of the role of your friendly country and the other Scandinavian countries in promoting the efforts of the United Nations to achieve its noble goals.
111.	The delegation of the Libyan Arab Republic takes this opportunity to laud and support the efforts made by the Secretary-General in the service of the Organization and its principles, for the realization of peace and security in the world.
112.	We wish to assure you, Mr. President, that the Libyan Arab Republic adheres sincerely to the Charter of the United Nations and to the principles of the Organization. In fact, Libya's foreign policy is based on the principles of non-alignment and, at the same time, a constant search to obtain the friendship of all peace-loving countries and peoples on the basis of mutual respect.
113.	In response to the wishes of the Libyan people to achieve their sovereignty, and in order to contribute to the reduction of international tension, the Revolutionary Government of the Libyan Arab Republic has eliminated the foreign bases imposed on its land in certain circumstances, and has succeeded in evacuating the last foreign troops from its soil. It was on the same basis that the Libyan Arab Republic participated in the non-aligned Conference held recently in Lusaka. The delegation of the Libyan Arab Republic takes this opportunity to commend the resolutions of that Conference, and considers their adoption an effective contribution on the part of the countries of the third world to the reduction of international tension and the promotion of world peace and security.
114.	This historic session of the General Assembly is being held in a strained international atmosphere; tension dominates international relations and the major problems of the world still await rapid and just solutions. Thus, the future and prestige of the United Nations depend precisely on the ability of the international Organization to face up to those problems and seek solutions to them, particularly as the Organization remains the indispensable instrument designed for the purpose of preserving peace and security.
115.	As we prepare to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of this international Organization, it is imperative to stop for a moment and review objectively the Organization's bright side as well as its dark side so that we may benefit from past errors and avoid repeating them, as well as evaluate the Organization's achievements in various domains. In so doing, we should candidly admit the Organization's errors and point out those responsible for their commission; at the same time, we should not disregard the Organization's achievements in the service of humanity.
116.	Our Organization has at times been able peace-fully to settle some regional conflicts and has indeed contributed to the preservation of peace in certain areas; it has also made progress in the process of decolonization, disarmament, and in the fields of human rights and social and economic development in the world,
117.	However, it should be noted that the United Nations has failed to achieve the basic purpose for which it was originally founded: namely, to face up to aggression and prevent occupation and annexation of territory through war and usurpation. This failure is best illustrated by the Organization's negative and inert stand towards Israel's persistent aggression against the Arab countries, and its continued occupation of territories of three States Members of this Organization. Likewise, the United Nations has repeatedly failed to implement scores of resolutions and recommendations adopted in the past twenty-five years, concerning the rights of oppressed peoples, self- determination and the achievement of the goals of social justice, economic development and the protection of human rights.
118.	It is unfortunate that during all these years the great Powers have sometimes used the United Nations for their own ends, having kept the status quo in the world and divided it into zones of influence. What is more alarming is the fact that in recent years a dangerous phenomenon has emerged: the great Powers, in trying to settle certain international conflicts, have done so outside the framework of the United Nations, depriving the smaller countries of the opportunity to express their views on important problems which deal with questions relating to security and stability in the world, and affecting the fate of peoples and nations. This has caused the Organization to grow weaker and its prestige to wane.
119.	Therefore the time has come for everyone to make sincere efforts to rebuild the United Nations. We believe that the cause of the Organization's shortcomings lies less in the United Nations than in the failure of certain countries to honor their obligations under the Charter. If the United Nations is to recover its prestige and carry out its task of establishing international peace and security, it is essential for it to apply the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter against any State which insists on disregarding the resolutions of the United Nations and on violating its Charter in particular, to stop the aggressors from reaping the fruit of their aggression, and force them to withdraw their occupying forces from foreign lands. Furthermore, Member States should be requested to reaffirm their respect for the Charter and their strict and complete adherence to the principles which prohibit the use of force in the settlement of international conflicts, as well as interference in other countries' domestic affairs. Also, Member States should once again respect one another's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
120.	We are now commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations under the motto of 'Peace, justice and progress'. The people of the Libyan Arab Republic, as well as all other peoples of the world, seek the establishment of international peace on the basis of justice. Progress, it should be said, is also the proper means to ensure- welfare and prosperity for peoples, and to create a better world for all mankind.
121.	The situation in the Middle East is deteriorating steadily as a result of Israel's persistent efforts since its creation to undermine any peace initiative in the area, for the simple reason that peace entails putting an end to Israel's expansionist plans and its racial policy. The painful events we witness today in the Middle East are but the direct result of Israel's disregard for all U lited Nations resolutions calling for the return of the Palestinian people to their occupied homes, lands, property, and farms, or for compensation for those who do not wish to return. These tragic events are also the result of Israel's violations of all human rights in occupied Arab territories, and its dis-regard of United Nations resolutions regarding the status of the city of Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Israel seeks to erect barriers to all efforts made inside and outside the United Nations which may lead to a just and permanent' settlement of the problem.
122.	In fact, Israel's decision to withdraw from the discussions scheduled to start under the auspices of Mr. Gunnur Jarring, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and its previous attempts to undermine the Four Power talks, are clear indications of Israel expansionist aims in the area. Furthermore, at a time when Israel openly declares its rejection of peace initiatives and prepares to launch a new aggression against the Arab countries, the United States of America, while pretending to be concerned about peace in the area, does everything to encourage Israel's attitude, shipping to that country Phantom and Skyhawk jets and large quantities of electronic equipment, and extending other types of assistance and support. The United States attitude can only be construed as an encouragement to Israel to pursue its aggressive policies, annex new territories, and continue its occupation of Arab lands. Such an attitude seriously imperils world peace and constitutes a breach by the United States of America of its special obligations as a great Power towards world peace and the United Nations.
123.	As a result of United States support of Israel the Arab States are compelled to seek arms in self-defense and to devote for that purpose substantial funds which otherwise could have been used for development plans.
124.	Allow me to point out briefly some facts pertaining to Zionism and Zionist aims in the area, in order that one may understand the crux of the problem in the Middle East, knowing full well that Zionism is an ideology dedicated to racism and expansionism.
125.	First, Israel will accept as borders only those designated for 'Greater Israel''. The simple conclusion to be drawn here is that the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 barely constitute the minimum under the expansionist plans drawn by Zionist leaders.
126.	Secondly, Israel was created by force and knows no other means of imposing its will and realizing its expansionist aims and racist policies. Consequently, it is not surprising that Israel continues to ignore world public opinion, and adamantly rejects the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and various international conferences.
127.	Thirdly, both Israel and Zionism have not so far recognized the rights of the people of Palestine, nor have they admitted that they have inflicted injustices on this people. Recently, Mrs. Meir was asked about the Palestinian people. 'The Palestinians? Who are they?' she reportedly answered. 'I have never heard of them before....' The lady should be reminded that the Palestinians have lived in that country for thousands of years, long before she and others set foot in the land of Palestine. It is the Palestinians who opened their doors to receive the persecuted Jews, who later ungratefully denied that gesture, and plotted with the colonialist Powers to drive them out of their lands. It is the Palestinians who, for the past 25 years, have lived in persecution, misery and suffering, while awaiting justice at the hands of the international Organization and the international community, expecting it to aid them in recovering their legitimate rights.
128.	It is those same Palestinians who are now struggling to establish a secular democratic State in Palestine where Jews, Christians and Moslems can live in peace and harmony, that being the most humanistic solution worthy of the support of this Organization as well as of all peace- and justice-loving peoples.
129.	Thus, it was with the full knowledge of the United Nations that the most heinous crime of the century was committed with the creation of the State of Israel, resulting in the eviction of a whole people and consequently the deprivation of its basic human rights, its rights to its land and country, and its basic right to self-determination. Yet, the United Nations has recognized the injustice inflicted upon the Palestinian people, as it has repeatedly taken cognizance of Israel's aggression. Such acknowledgment is evident in the many resolutions that have consistently been adopted by the Organization since its inception until now, both in the Security Council and in the General Assembly.
130.	We believe that the only way to put an end to those violations of the Charter and to Israel's continued attempts to impose its will on the whole world is through the application of the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter, and by reconsidering Israel's membership in the United Nations, before its aggressive acts become a dangerous precedent for those countries which may be tempted to follow suit. Such a development would certainly undermine world peace and the world Organization, while threatening the future of all mankind.
131.	As we celebrate the silver jubilee of the United Nations and commemorate the tenth anniversary of the historical Declaration on decolonization, it is unfortunate to note that many peoples are still under the yoke of colonialism and that man is still enslaved by his fellow men who avidly exploit his resources and deprive him of his basic human rights and his right to self-determination.
132.	It is for this reason that a stronger stand is called for towards colonial Powers and imperialism. We should reaffirm the legitimacy of the struggle of colonial peoples those who were evicted from their land, and those who are forced to live under foreign occupation. We should demand that all kinds of assistance should be given to those peoples in order to enable them to exercise their right to self-determination.
133.	The Libyan Arab Republic is deeply concerned about the military intervention of the United States of America in South-East Asia. We pay here a tribute to the heroic struggle of the peoples of that region for their freedom and independence, and we demand the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops so that those people can freely exercise their right to self- determination.
134.	The Libyan Arab Republic supports the inalienable rights of the peoples of the African continent in Mozambique, Angola, Guinea (Bissau), Namibia and Southern Rhodesia, and also supports their struggle to rid themselves of foreign rules in order to fulfill their aspirations to freedom and independence.
135.	The delegation of the Libyan Arab Republic condemns very strongly the apartheid policy of the Government of South Africa, and condemns even more strongly those countries which extend military and economic assistance to the colonial racist regimes in the southern part of the African continent. Without such assistance, those regimes could never have been able to continue their hegemony in the area.
136.	It is the opinion of our delegation that if the international Organization is fully to meet its responsibilities, its universality should be achieved by admitting to its membership the People's Republic of China, which includes over a fifth of the world population, thus creating efficient international co-operation and reducing international tension.
137.	Regarding international social and economic conditions, we note with a measure of satisfaction the progress realized by the countries of the third world in the fields of economic and social development during the sixties, despite the many obstacles faced by those countries. Such optimistic impressions should not, however, hide the obvious and bitter fact, unacceptable to world conscience and represented in hundreds of millions of people still living below a standard befitting mankind, while only a minority reaps the benefits of modern science and technology. This condition requires us collectively to exercise concerted efforts to put the final touches to the draft of an international development strategy [A 17982, para. 16] which will be adopted during this session for the purpose of narrowing the gap between the rich north and the poor south, and of raising the standards of living of mankind in general and the peoples of developing countries in particular.
138.	Regarding the peaceful uses of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, the Libyan delegation believes that it is of the utmost importance urgently to prepare the draft declaration regarding the formulation of comprehensive and balanced sets of principles governing the activities of States in this field, to be adopted by the General Assembly during this session. While the Libyan delegation is concerned about the delay in the work of the committee entrusted with the drafting of the project, it nevertheless pays a tribute to some of the positive aspects in the work of that committee.
139.	The Libyan delegation considers also that the time is now appropriate to hold a third conference on the law of the sea, for the purpose of reviewing the regimes of the high seas, continental shelf, territorial waters, contiguous waters, marine resources, and the preservation of living resources in the high seas, so that a clear and internationally acceptable definition can be found for the area of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.
140.	In conclusion, permit me, Mr. President, to assure you that the delegation of the Libyan Arab Republic is disposed to co-operate with you and with all other delegations, and takes this opportunity to offer its greetings to all the heads and members of delegations, hoping that this session will be crowned with success.




"
25,1970,ARG,"177.	 : It is a fortunate coincidence that precisely at a time when the United Nations is celebrating its first twenty-five years of existence, an eminent jurist so closely linked to our Organization should have been elected to preside over the General Assembly. On behalf of the Argentine Government, it is a pleasure for me to congratulate Your Excellency, Mr. President, on this felicitous choice.
178.	Through you I should also like to express the appreciation of the Argentine delegation to Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph of Liberia, for the work she performed as President of the twenty-fourth session.
179.	From this rostrum, the Argentine Government wishes to express to the delegation of the United Arab Republic its regret and sympathy upon the recent death of His Excellency President Gamal Abdel Nasser. The loss of this outstanding statesman has not only plunged the Arab world into mourning, but has also deeply grieved all those who greatly valued his capacity to contribute actively to the establishment of peace in the Middle East.
180.	When the Organization of the United Nations was created in 1945, its founders had two fundamental purposes in mind: on the one hand, solemnly to formulate the basic principles of the international system and, on the other, to establish a legal framework in keeping with the political and social needs of the immediate postwar era. Both objectives were the result of the historical experience of mankind and of the interests and aspirations which all civilized nations can in no way renounce. The enunciation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations was thus considered as a sign of moral evolution and maturity of peoples.
181.	The need to rely upon a stable management of international relations is also deeply rooted in the history of nations. In the course of time, a number of philosophical and legal-political currents proposed guiding principles that went beyond State limits. Up to the beginning of the twentieth century, for more or less lengthy periods, international peace had been ensured by means of treaties signed among the great Powers. These laid the groundwork for peace and de facto established conditions for international stability. The so-called 'European concert' is good proof of this concept which restricted the active access of the nonEuropean states to international life.
182.	The growing democratization of the international society and the part played in the solution of controversies by the small countries contributed to the crumbling of that restricted concept of the system and to laying the foundations for a legal-political structure of worldwide scope resting upon the consent and equality of States based on a distribution of responsibilities. This was precisely what the League of Nations sought to accomplish. The catastrophe of the Second World War is the clearest proof of the way in which that organization had to yield to the trends that finally proved it incapable of maintaining peace among States.
183.	However, the need for an international normative system was summed up in a number of international instruments and conferences, from the Atlantic Charter in 1941 to Dumbarton Oaks in 1944. It was the San Francisco Conference, however, which was ultimately to adopt the Charter of the United Nations, thus taking those historic aspirations up again and embarking upon a new era in the management of international affairs.
184.	It might justifiably have been felt at that time that, when the United Nations linked the ideals of peace and security with the existence of adequate legal machinery that it had thereby ensured international stability and harmony among nations.
185.	Today it is not difficult to prove that, although the principles may still be valid, the actual force of many of them is relative. Future historians of this quarter-century will no doubt use as a guiding thread the listings of constant violations of those principles in almost all areas of the world. They will also be able to show the lack of efficiency of many measures, the existence of which seemed to end at the time of their adoption.
186.	There is a notorious maladjustment between institution and reality. We are not referring here to the discrepancy that may exist between what should be and what factually is. We know that ideals always precede their practical fulfillment. History has shown to what extent ideas that at one time were deemed Utopian gradually became specific and indispensable factors of our everyday life.
187.	The discrepancy between the normative framework and reality to which we refer here is of a different nature. We have drawn away from the empiric possibilities that existed, and we sometimes tend to forget that our Organization is supported by the political will of the Member States. Proclaiming principles does not in itself make them realities, and it is not sufficient to multiply the legal machinery when the latter is not based upon the social reality it is intended to regulate.
188.	Furthermore, if we are fully aware of the difficulties that our Organization faces in settling important questions bearing on international peace and security, it is difficult to understand how year after year we are willing to allow the agenda of the United Nations to be swollen by secondary items which consume so much time and money and are doomed to remain without solution. The bureaucratic and budgetary growth of our Organization and the useless waste of effort are unavoidable consequences of such an attitude.
189.	Mention has been made of the need to revise the Charter. Theoretically speaking we cannot but support such a measure, but from the practical point of view we are fully aware of the almost insuperable problems that such a step implies. Perhaps it might be more worthwhile to make an effort to try to use to the utmost those resources provided for and authorized by the Charter, instead of undertaking a scarcely possible revision, particularly with regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes. If, furthermore, we wish to act with a practical awareness, we must bear in mind that some of the measures approved by this General Assembly or by the Security Council require adequate financial resources for full implementation. Very often extremely serious functional maladjustments are due to the fact that this elementary circumstance has been overlooked.
190.	The United Nations will be what its Member States wish it to be. What is most serious is that as we pare down our active participation or neglect the consideration of our possibilities it becomes more difficult to put into practice the Purposes and Principles of the Charter, thus endangering international peace and security.
191.	The skepticism and discouragement with which many of our contemporaries gauge the actions of the
United Nations are understandable. We, as representatives of the States Members of the Organization, have the duty to be honest with ourselves and to adopt a critical stand that will permit us to judge both our successes and our failures objectively.
192.	In order to carry out such an analysis, we might establish a threefold division of problems. First of all, there are those that have been practically or entirely settled, and in this case our satisfaction at what has been accomplished is justified. Secondly, there are those problems that have acquired a chronic degree of gravity and have been awaiting solution for years. In this case discouragement is well founded, and it is urgent that we adopt effective measures to correct the structural and operational flaws in our Organization. Thirdly, there are the new problems created by the emergence of facts that have changed the world situation. In this last case we should act with sufficient determination so that these matters will become part of the first of this series and not swell the ranks of the second group.
193.	Decolonization belongs in the first group of problems. This has surely been one of the outstanding phenomena of our day. New States in full enjoyment of their sovereignty, have become active participants in the international system. The principle of the self determination of peoples has thus found its true application, and its observance has helped to enrich the international political situation. Resolution 1514 (XV), the tenth anniversary of which we shall soon be marking, served to hasten the winding-up process of the colonialist regimes and to ensure a greater equality, at least in the political field, among the peoples of the world. The Argentine Republic is firmly convinced that decolonization must be totally carried out.
194.	For that reason we continue to be concerned over the situation of the Territories of southern Africa which still remain under colonial administration. Within this context, the atmosphere is further troubled by the existence of a Government which illegally holds power in Southern Rhodesia, by the racial discrimination that is represented by apartheid and by the non recognition of the authority of the United Nations of which we are witnesses in Namibia.
195.	In this context I wish to refer to a matter of vital importance to the Argentine Republic: the question of the Malvinas Islands. True to its diplomatic traditions, my Government agreed to negotiate with the United Kingdom regarding the dispute over the sovereignty of the islands. In so doing, we were interpreting the spirit and the letter of resolution 2065 (XX) and, at the same time, we declared our irrevocable decision shared by all the people of Argentina to have the Malvinas Islands restored to our territorial, heritage. Since the end of the last session of this General Assembly negotiations have continued on the diplomatic level. It was with great interest that we pursued the talks regarding the problem of communications between the Islands and the Argentine mainland, for we believe that these are the first steps towards the solution of the dispute. In due course, we shall report on the results of these talks.
196.	Those whose votes have made it possible for Argentina and the United Kingdom to begin their talks with a view to ending a situation which is incompatible with the terms of resolution 1514 (XV) did so because they considered that decolonization is an irreversible process that brooks no exceptions. There can, furthermore, be no doubt that the question of the Malvinas Islands is an obstacle to the development of the ties that should link Argentina with the United Kingdom increasingly closely. Therefore, the solution to this problem cannot be unduly delayed. My Government reaffirms is right to raise the matter again in this Assembly if the talks fail or if they are excessively prolonged.
197.	We believe it urgent that these cases should be solved so that they will not remain to swell the number of problems in the second of the groups I have mentioned, that is, the problems pending solution.
198.	The question of general and complete disarmament also belongs in this category. If we consider the consequences of the qualitative development of the new systems of weaponry on the life of international society, it is difficult to presume that the efforts to achieve an easing of political tension within the system can possibly show lasting results while the arsenals of the great Powers remain at their present levels or are increased.
199.	For this reason my Government attaches considerable importance to the strategic arms limitation talks which are taking place bilaterally between the United States and the Soviet Union, but we feel it necessary to recall the fact that urgent measures should be adopted for nuclear disarmament within the context of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.
200.	Argentina continues to participate actively in the deliberations of the Conference of the Committee, on disarmament convinced as it is of the vital importance of seeking ari understanding that might help to dissipate the threat of a nuclear catastrophe.
201.	That Conference has submitted to this present session a draft treaty prohibiting the emplacement of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and ocean floors and on the subsoil thereof . The document on which we are now to take a stand contains significant changes compared to the one that was considered at the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Some of these tend to protect the legitimate interests of the coastal States and at the same time prevent those provisions covering verification from prejudging matters touching upon the law of the sea. Argentina attaches special relevance to all of these principles, as is attested to by our active participation in the amendment of the previous draft. The text, such as it has been presented to the General
Assembly, has our support and we hope that it will be approved by a widespread majority of Member States.
202.	The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has continued the examination of the question of chemical and bacteriological (biological) weapons on the basis of the two draft conventions and other proposals which were submitted to it. The Committee has dedicated itself to the treatment of both types of armaments and has seriously considered the political and technical aspects pertaining to the subject. My Government attaches special significance to the problem of verification procedures which it might be necessary to adopt. It is to be hoped that the General Assembly will recommend that the Committee should continue this task which, although difficult, is nevertheless most necessary.
203.	With regard to the elaboration of a detailed program on general and complete disarmament, the report submitted by the Committee shows that this matter was one of its main concerns. We deem it advisable to reiterate that the aim of the program must be the achieving of general and complete disarmament under effective international control. On various occasions we had already warned about the negative consequences of collateral measures which, because of their discriminatory character, actually constitute the 'disarmament of the unarmed' and do not signify a true contribution to the achievement of a true general armaments reduction.
204.	There can be no doubt that the conflict in the Middle East is one of the typical cases that has not as yet found a settlement within the framework of the United Nations. It is to be hoped that the encouraging symptoms noticed lately will help to allay the suspicions that have been felt by both parties. Thus the first steps may then be taken towards the effective implementation of resolution 242 (1967) of the Security Council, in the drafting of which Argentina played a significant part. We believe that this resolution points to the right road to peace. Furthermore, my Government reaffirms its faith in the Jarring mission as a means towards understanding and, through the participation of Argentine officers, will continue to cooperate in the supervision of the ceasefire in the Suez Canal area.
205.	SouthEast Asia is also a source of serious concern. That grave problem can be settled only if negotiations among those directly involved are pursued in a spirit in keeping with the Charter. The continuous delays which hinder the elimination of this permanent breach of the peace are contrary to the purposes of the United Nations.
206.	We cannot in this context overlook the constant danger being run by those who, in their capacity as news correspondents, are present in the zone of conflict in order to carry out their difficult task of keeping world public opinion informed of the battles more efficiently and accurately. Respect for human rights during armed conflicts requires special observance in the case of news correspondents during hostilities. My own country is prepared to consider measures to guarantee greater security to those engaged in this important work.
207.	Both the situation in the Middle East and that of SouthEast Asia are of concern to the community of nations not only because of the constant losses in human lives, but also because, despite their apparently regional nature, they may endanger the security of the entire system. We know full well that the interests at stake in this case go beyond th? direct participants in the struggle. Reference to these cases is necessary in a statement made before this Assembly. The trouble with periodic repetitions is that the problems we are analyzing tend to become Commonplace. Nothing could be more grave and serious than to accustom ourselves to living with war and destruction and to think that both are inevitable at a given time in history. Our insistence therefore in referring to these conflicts must not be interpreted as a repetition of just another rhetorical sentence, but as the proof of a deeply felt concern.
208.	Among the third group of problems mentioned, that is, those that have emerged recently, must be listed a question that warrants special attention because it seriously bears upon international peace and security. I refer to the committing of acts of violence and terrorism that constitute true crimes in terms of international criminal law. Violence and subversion, especially in Latin America, have acquired such a scope and magnitude in certain cases as to affect the very basis of international order. If we truly wish to practice tolerance as a fundamental attribute of democracy in our continent, we cannot permit indiscriminate violence, alleging pretexts of confused political ideals in order to convert crimes offensive to human conscience into instruments of social transformation. The Argentine people categorically rejects the committing of those crimes, which are completely alien to its way of life and to the philosophy of freedom which supports it.
209.	In the Organization of American States the Republic of Argentina has pointed out the need to define and then to prevent and to punish this type of crime. The Argentine Government understands that it js incumbent upon each State to adopt those measures it deems necessary to repress acts that violate order and security within its own territory. Yet the knowledge that in many cases terrorists and kidnappers receive some kind of foreign assistance in the form of money, weapons or training forces us to consider the need to encourage concerted action on a worldwide scale so that those individuals will not escape justice. Within the regional framework, the InterAmerican Juridical Committee four days ago, on 26 September, approved a draft convention on terrorism and kidnapping of persons with a view to extortion, which will be submitted for the consideration of members of the Organization of American States. It should be pointed out that article 10 of that draft provides that the Convention will remain open 'for signature by the member States of the Organization of American States, as well as any other State Member of the United Nations or any other State invited to do so by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States'.
210.	The increasing frequency of acts of hijacking deserves unanimous condemnation by all States Members of the Organization. Argentina considers that the United Nations should adopt adequate measures to prevent recurrence of this crime.
211.	I wish now to refer to one of the subjects of greatest significance on the agenda of this twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, namely, the Second United Nations Development Decade and the plan for a global strategy which we are to set in motion during the commemorative period of the present session. Lengthy has been the road covered in the last few years in order to put into practice the principles of the Charter in matters of international cooperation for economic and social progress of all peoples. A clear example of this is what took place during the decade of the 1960s when, for the first time, an effort was made to establish equal opportunities for countries at different levels of development, through a systematization of efforts to achieve specific growth objectives. During those years the aspirations of the developing countries were clearly seen and intense multilateral activity took place.
212.	In the various United Nations specialized agencies, in the Economic and Social Council and in the General Assembly, we have in the last few years succeeded in identifying the elements on which to base national efforts and international cooperation. Those elements have been embodied in a considerable number of documents on global and sectoral objectives for economic and social development. With regard to these objectives, there exists an almost unanimous agreement on the part of the different sectors, or at least a sound and honest will to reach a compromise.
213.	The study of the final form the agreements on political measures for tne fulfillment of those objectives should have is at present in the last stage of negotiation, and it is a promising sign that those talks are not on the substance of the problem but only on a timetable for implementation. This fact alone renders obvious the spirit in which the international community is entering the decade of the seventies, a decade which will be called upon to put into practice agreed measures for the achievement of the objectives of development.
214.	In the implementation of those measures an equal share of responsibility will be borne by both the developed and the developing countries. It is a matter of uniting efforts and of adding to the solidarity of the more industrialized nations, as well as the determination of the other countries to make serious and continuous progress along the road of their own development. Sterile confrontations or the complacency of the recipients of aid can only delay solutions and benefit those who thrive on inertia. For this reason we believe in conciliating interests. Our strategy must consist in promoting a range of positive solutions which, by gradually including new measures or widening the scope of already adopted instruments, will raise to an increasingly high and efficient level economic cooperation among all Members of the Organization. Only thus will we reach the targets set for the Second United Nations Development Decade.
215.	One of the factors that has had the greatest impact on the history of the last twenty-five years has been the astounding progress of science and technology. Ours has been called the era of the scientific civilization. That description is not an arbitrary one. Never before has the destiny of mankind depended so much on the rational conquest of nature. Never before have discoveries in the field of science and their immediate application through technology so substantially altered human and interState relations. Those countries which lack adequate means in order to utilize science and technology fully will be left outside the flow of history. The intellectual power has today become the fourth sector of the economy. The advanced communities are in fact 'study societies'.
216.	The Argentine Republic is ready to intensify further the policy of achieving agreements with other States for cooperation and mutual assistance in the field of science and technology. Within the United Nations we shall support as we do in the Organization of American States any proposals designed to encourage basic research and the transfer of applied technology. We believe that if this transfer is not carried out and if international sharing of the burdens of research is not increased, all other efforts made to bridge the gaps between countries at different levels of development will be in vain.
217.	We firmly believe that multilateral cooperation, such as that carried out in the specialized agencies and bodies, particularly in the United Nations Development program, is a proof of what the United Nations can achieve when there is apolitical will of commitment in the field of assistance.
218.	When modern science and technology became a decisive factor in international life, new fields were opened up for the legal regulation or settlement of relations among States. One of these was that of the seabed and ocean floor. Argentina considers that the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction should be considered the common heritage of mankind. It is unfortunate that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the SeaBed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction has not yet reached an agreement on a declaration of principles to be submitted to the General Assembly, in accordance with the terms of resolution 2574 B (XXIV). The Republic of Argentina believes that the Declaration of principles should reflect the necessary adaptation of the law to the changes that occur in international life.
219.	Once the Committee has drafted the regime applicable to the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, the time will have come for the convening of a comprehensive conference on the law of the sea. That conference will have, to deal with all those aspects that may require revision or establishment due to the appearance of interests or situations calling for new international legal regulation. Thus, the criteria set forth by the General Assembly in resolution 2574 B (XXIV) will be complied with.
220.	Argentina wishes to express its satisfaction at the work done by the Special Committee on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States. My country has had the honor of participating in the work of the Special Committee since its creation in 1964 and has endeavored at all times to make a most constructive contribution to its deliberations. We consider that the draft declaration [A18082, para. 8] that has finally been prepared is a valuable document for the codification and progressive development of fundamental principles of international law and we are ready to give it our full support when it is considered by the General Assembly.
221.	When the Charter of the United Nations was signed in the city of San Francisco twenty-five years ago, precisely 150 years had elapsed since publication of a short essay of prophetic intuition. In his native city of Konigsberg, Emmanuel Kant, in 1795, published his 'Essay on perpetual peace'. In it he attempted to show that universal peace was not only desirable and conceivable, but necessary and inevitable. In order to achieve it, there had to exist an international order based on a law consented to by all nations. Thus:' 'each State, even the smallest, could expect respect for its security and its rights, not through its own power or its own definition of the law, but simply as the result of the existence of a great society of nations, all abiding by laws adopted through their united will'.
222.	The important fact in our day is that this united will for peace, considered as an indivisible entity, should be universal in scope. Perhaps the very stability of our international system as a conditioning factor requires that we do not set aside the undeniable factual realities of the world of today. If this be the case, then we have the right to wonder how this concern can be rendered compatible with a restricted universalization of the United Nations.
223.	In the course of this statement we have mentioned a series of facts that are of concern to us as they affect peace or hamper the effective achievement of international cooperation. I do not believe it difficult to agree with this analysis. But this would not be complete without mentioning, as one of the undeniable achievements of the Organization, the fact that it has localized and solved some of the conflicts that might have had serious effects on international peace and security. The United Nations has effectively contributed to keeping alive our awareness of the danger to all mankind of a generalized conflict. It is this very awareness which leads us to view with interest the signing of the recent Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the USSR which will contribute to detente in Europe.
224.	A hundred years ago, a great Argentine thinker, Juan Bautista Alberdi, wrote that:
'War is the justice every one works out for himself failing world justice. World justice is lacking because the world is deprived of unity and does not as yet constitute an international society. Therefore, the way to abolish war is to help the consolidation of the world into a State of States, a society of societies, a nation of nations, as a type of entity to work out a justice that, today, everyone works out for himself, by means of war.'
225.	In 1970, we now have this 'nation of nations'. If justice is to be imposed by the threat or use of force, and if man, in all areas, has not yet achieved the dignity he deserves, the future will hold us responsible.
226.	The .Argentine Republic, within the framework of its international commitments, will maintain the principle of freedom of action of its foreign policy in an ever increasingly interdependent world and pledges all its efforts to fulfill the desire for peace and cooperation which twenty-five years ago was embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.
"
25,1970,YUG,"
81.	  Mr. President, I should like to address my first words to you in your capacity of representative of Norway, a country with which Yugoslavia maintains extremely friendly relations dating back to the difficult hours of the Second World War, and I wish to congratulate you most warmly, on behalf of the Yugoslav delegation, on your election as President of this anniversary session of the General Assembly. We see in this a tribute not only to your country but also to your undeniable personal qualities.
82.	Yugoslavia, as one of the founders of the United Nations, signed the Charter two and a half decades ago with a firm belief in the purposes and principles of the Charter and a resolve to strive consistently towards their realization.

83.	The image of the world has been significantly altered during the past twenty-five years. The world has changed much although it has not changed for the better. The peace that we now have is neither a lasting peace nor a peace for all. There are countries and peoples that not only are dying in war this very day, but also have never even known peace. The growth 6f science and the upsurge of technology have failed to improve the lot of the majority of mankind; they have even failed to upgrade the standards of living of the broader sections of the population even in countries where their impact has been the greatest. The lofty principles of the Charter freedom, independence, sovereignty of peoples and States are frequently and wantonly subjected to the interests of the bigger and the stronger. The rights and dignity of man are being mercilessly violated by social injustice, racial discrimination and religious and national prejudices.
84.	For all these reasons, we are faced with the following question: shall the inadequacies of the present day world be a source of apathy and despair or a motive force for more radical undertakings and more resolute action by our Organization? We firmly believe that the unacceptable realities of our times should not be preserved for the sake of so-called political realism which advocates helplessness and immobility.
85.	All of the foregoing facts in no way overshadow the truth that the United Nations, acting in such contradictory circumstances, has none the less remained an irreplaceable factor of unification and rapprochement of peoples and countries differing in size and economic power and having diverse social and political systems. Neither we nor this Organization can deny the fact that in the realization of the basic objectives enshrined in the Charter as priority aims the prevention of war and safeguarding of peace and security and the promotion of the free and independent development of all peoples the United Nations has encountered almost insurmountable obstacles and that its role has remained limited.
86.	The United Nations is but a mirror of the situation prevailing in international relations. It reflects all that is negative and all that is positive in the overall development of the international situation. I presume that we all wish the United Nations to become something more than this.
87.	The world with which we are dissatisfied cannot be improved overnight, but it can be destroyed overnight. For this reason the United Nations should be the tireless initiator and champion of a sweeping undertaking aimed at developing new relations which will ensure genuine security and full equality among all States and peoples in the world. The United Nations must become an Organization which will serve all and which will not be arbitrarily dominated by anyone.
88.	Of symbolic significance is the fact that under the auspices of this high Organization the first youth assembly  was held, at which representatives of the youth of all continents were able to present their views on the world and to express their hopes and expectations with regard to the United Nations. Young people throughout the world are not slaves to prejudices inherited by us from earlier times and events. Their refusal to reconcile themselves with the state of the world as it is and with the existing situation in society is becoming an ever more significant factor whose political and moral significance should not be underestimated. The world of youth is the world of tomorrow. The greater togetherness and understanding among youth is becoming a decisive factor of rapprochement and understanding among men and peoples. The United Nations could see to it that such a role of the young people becomes an integral part of its own objectives, and efforts.
89.	Finally, I wish to stress that the effective role of the United Nations is inconceivable without the Organization's total universality. It has become utterly absurd to attempt further to deny the right of the People's Republic of China, a right to which it is entitled under the Charter, to take its place among the Member States of the United Nations and thus facilitate its active participation in the work of this international Organization. It is good to see an increasing number of countries supporting this request. How can we ensure progress in the solution of the most pressing international issues in the United Nations if the People's Republic of China and other States which are still outside our Organization do not take part in their settlement? If the United Nations wishes to represent the whole world in pursuance of its Charter, then the whole world should be in the United Nations.
90.	Yugoslavia had the honor to be one of the 63 participants at the recently held Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries in Lusaka. This, the largest gathering of Heads of State or Government ever held outside the United Nations, clearly reflected a high degree of awareness of the common interests of the nonaligned countries as well as of aspirations that are identical with those of a much larger number of States. This imposing gathering of the leaders of countries representing more than half of the Member States of the United Nations not only shed light upon the pressing issues confronting mankind, but adopted, very specific conclusions as to what should be done to secure a better tomorrow, to strengthen world peace and security and to establish democratic relations among peoples. This, we hope, will have a direct impact upon the further activity of the United Nations. In this connexion, the Head of the Yugoslav delegation, President Tito, said, inter alia'.
'The twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly and our gathering in Lusaka have their logical link both in terms of time and substance. These two events constitute for us, the nonaligned countries, a whole; they reflect it. can be said the same historical concept. The reassertion of the principles of the Charter and the strengthening of the United Nations constitute, at the same time, a
demand for further and speedier democratization of
international relations.'
91.	The organic link between the aims of the non aligned countries and the efforts of the United Nations has become closer and more obvious than ever before.
92.	In the present day world, divided into military, economic and political blocs, the policy of force, imperialism and foreign domination definitely obstructs free international cooperation and greatly limits the place and role of a considerable number of countries. Should such a state of affairs remain unchanged and should the status quo based on bloc positions be legalized, then it would be illusory to 'speak of a lasting peace, of security for all, of independence, sovereignty and equitable cooperation among States.
93.	The process of examining some problems of general interest for the world community has been initiated, but participation in their solution is restricted to a very small number of countries. Attempts to preserve such a state of affairs and to reserve for the superPowers and the blocs headed by them the right to take decisions about the fate of peace and security and on other vital problems which affect the whole world are a matter of concern.
94.	For this reason the era of negotiation as we term the times in which we live will fulfill our expectations only if, at the same time, it turns out to be an era of consolidation of universal peace, security, independence, sovereignty and wider possibilities for unimpeded internal development.
95.	A genuine and durable peace and general security can only be built in conditions of the strict and universal application of the principles of the United Nations Charter. No country can be absolved, under any circumstances or for any reasons or motives, from respect for and implementation of these principles in international relations. This is precisely what the founders of this world Organization had in mind when they adopted the Charter of the United Nations twenty-five years ago.
96.	The favorable evolution, which of late has been evidenced in Europe, has yielded some concrete results, as can be seen from the recently concluded treaty on the renunciation of force between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.9 We attach, of course, the greatest importance to these positive trends, not only because we ourselves are a European country, but also because of the undeniable influence of such agreements upon broader developments in the international community.
97.	We are convinced that conditions are continually being created for intensified efforts by all European countries in the sense of a further easement of tensions, promotion of all-round cooperation, overcoming of the existing division and establishment of equitable and secure conditions in Europe, in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter. The proposed European conference, as a broad and democratic
gathering of all European and other interested States, could then play a useful role. Such contacts, reasserting the independence of all countries and their full equality, could also stimulate the development of new and lasting forms of multilateral cooperation in Europe, even of new institutional forms of European security founded upon the Charter and organically linked, in a specific manner, to the United Nations.
98.	The present detente in Europe will prove to be deceptive unless it becomes part of a general relaxation in the world. Regrettably, in many other areas of the world, dangerous crises, military conflicts and aggressions continue to persist.
99.	In spite of the decision of the Security Council and ever wider dissatisfaction of the international community, Israel continues to occupy vast territories of Arab countries. The most recent developments in the Middle East serve as sufficient evidence that Israel has actually not changed its policy. It would be very dangerous to ignore this fact and to fail to realize that the eleventh hour has struck for taking steps while there is still time for a peaceful solution on the basis of the Security Council resolution. We must admit that, regardless of the immediate causes, the recent bloodshed in Jordan also falls within the context of broader consequences of the expansionist policy of Israel in this area, a component part of which is also the failure to recognize, over a number of years, the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Our concern at the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East is even greater as the growing crisis is extending the area of tension to the entire Mediterranean, and even to a large part of Europe and is adversely affecting overall international relations.
100.	The situation in VietNam and in SouthEast Asia as a whole is now considerably graver than it was last year. Cambodia has become a theater of war devastation as a consequence of military intervention by primarily nonAsian Powers in that formerly independent and nonaligned country. It has been proved that the so-called VietNamization is leading to an expansion, and not a reduction, of the war. The events have confirmed the viewpoint which we, like many others, have expressed on a number of occasions, namely, that peace in SouthEast Asia can be secured only if the right of the peoples of VietNam and Laos, and now also of Cambodia, to independence and sovereign determination of their own future, without external interference or meddling, is finally recognized and respected.
101.	Colonial and racist oppression in the southern part of Africa is assuming more and more alarming proportions. In the opinion of the Yugoslav delegation the world Organization is faced with a pressing need to take energetic and resolute measures for the eradication of colonialism. The entire world, and above all Africa, knows that this is a question not of a lack of power but of a lack of will to act. The world community should muster courage and resources to erase this blot from our century.
102.	The point of departure and the foundation of international security is the development of such relations in the world as will ensure the full independence, the equal rights and sovereignty of all countries. The timely resistance of the international community to all possible threats and recourse to force in settling disputes constitutes another significant component of international security.
103.	Inherent in every conflict in this world which has become so interdependent, is the danger that such conflict may be transformed into one of major proportions. Therefore we expect the current session of the General Assembly to chart the main course for long term activities in strengthening international security and safeguarding peace, as these tasks deserve the highest priority. People seek a sound peace and not a deceptive truce. The first vital step in that direction is the curbing of the arms race and the initiation of the disarmament process. How often has it been pointed out in vain that the arms race not only is fraught with unforeseeable consequences for peace and security but is absorbing greater and greater material, financial and industrial potentials at a time when millions of people in the developing countries lack the most essential conditions for existence.
104.	Without minimizing the complexity of the disarmament problem, we should like to express our conviction that it is precisely the great Powers, the ones possessing the greatest stocks of modern weapons, which bear the chief responsibility for past failures to halt the arms race and to resolve the disarmament problems. The last session of the General Assembly provided a vital impulse for action in this field. However, what has been done so far is far from sufficient. The Yugoslav delegation will be more than pleased to cooperate with other delegations in the adoption of a more substantive and comprehensive disarmament program during the current session. We also deem it essential to adopt at thi? ™ssion a treaty prohibiting the emplacement of nucleai <ons or other weapons of mass destruction on or .uer the seabed, as the first step towards the total demilitarization of the seabed. We also wish to stress the urgency of banning chemical and bacteriological weapons. Proceeding from such a conviction, the Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia recently adopted a decision to renounce unilaterally the manufacture and use of these dangerous weapons.
105.	While in the developed parts of the world there is t>,n enormous concentration of productive forces and technological progress, the development process is showing a more and more evident lag in other parts of the world. The fact that this truth is not new can certainly not console us. The efforts exerted by the developing countries to develop and utilize to the utmost their own potentials and constantly to foster mutual cooperation are limited by numerous external factors which they cannot influence without the support and cooperation of the developed countries, whose possibilities in this respect are boundless. True, a small number of developed countries appreciate this need and have committed themselves to set aside substantial resources for a more rapid development of less developed countries. However, there are still many, and the richest countries at that, that have not shown such readiness. The world cannot be stable if it is condemned to perpetual economic disparity. We are thus faced with the urgent need to bring about profound changes in order to implement a new international development policy and a more rapid integration of the developing countries into the mainstream of the world's material, scientific and cultural progress, from which in the long run the developed countries themselves will benefit. More specifically, that is the very essence of the international development strategy for the Second Development Decade which should be adopted during this session in the hope that it will, as distinct from the first Decade, yield more tangible results.
106.	It is the desire of my Government that this anniversary session should provide a clearer image of a new vision of the world. We are gathered together in this Organization not merely to discuss the situation in the world or to describe it but also to contribute to its gradual change. We are deeply convinced that this session can open up broader vistas for changes in the world, which must be not only a different but also a better world. Every step forward along this path will, at the same time, be a genuine contribution to the anniversary of the United Nations. My Government is prepared to do its utmost towards that end.



"
25,1970,SLE,"110.	Mr, President, on behalf of the Government and people of Sierra Leone, I take this opportunity to express to you our warm and hearty congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your election is as much a tribute to you as to your great country. It is a recognition of your long association with this world Organization and the active and constructive role you have played in it over the years since the days of San Francisco. It is equally indicative of our high regard for the liberal traditions of your motherland and the objectivity it has brought to bear on the burning international problems of our time. In this historic year of its twenty-fifth anniversary, the Organization is fortunate to have such wise and able leadership and we are confident that, with your background of experience and distinguished service, you will guide our deliberation^ with singular success and bring even greater honor to the country you have served and represented with such eminence.
111.	We should like to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph of Liberia, who during her tenure of office conducted the affairs of the General Assembly with skill, patience and determination and brought our work to a fruitful conclusion. It shows the significance of the status of women in the third world that the AfroAsian group has produced the only two women Presidents of the General Assembly during the lifetime of the United Nations.
112.	We congratulate our SecretaryGeneral, U Thant, for his report on the achievements of the Organization during the past year [A18001]. We have observed with interest the cautious optimism he has expressed with regard to the world situation as a whole.
In his diagnosis he has attempted to portray the truth with vividness and eloquence.
113.	The strategic arms limitation talks have been described as the most important disarmament discussions since the Second World War. This and the breakthrough in the peace talks on the Middle East, the gradual reduction of the war in SouthEast Asia and the signing of the nonaggression treaty between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Federal Republic of Germany  have lessened international tensions considerably but have not completely eliminated them. The superPowers, regardless of their already acquired capacity to achieve total physical destruction of each other at least ten to fifteen times over, continue to develop new and more sophisticated weapons of total annihilation. The balance of nuclear potentialities has brought about not an end to wars but rather a nuclear stalemate. The conventional arms race, with even more dangerous possibilities, continues to produce and disseminate more sophisticated and deadly weapons. It affects all nations, both nuclear and non nuclear, developed and developing, and provides the mear.s for limited wars which contain the seeds of the threat of nuclear war. Finance, which is badly needed to alleviate the misery and sufferings of man, is being spent on massive military budgets. Approximately $200,000 million are spent annually on armaments while less than $15,000 million are budgeted by industrialized countries for aid to developing nations. Virtually no progress has been made towards the achievement of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, which would ensure the safety of posterity from a possible global holocaust. Seven full years have passed since the signing of the partial test ban Treaty; yet some States whose participation is essential, if the nuclear arms race is to be curbed and if mankind is to be saved from the hazards of further radioactive contamination, have not subscribed to the Treaty.
114.	My delegation wholeheartedly welcomes the entry into force on 5 March this year of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]an occasion of historic importance which heralded what has been described as the United Nations Disarmament Decade. The considerable amount of interest manifested by Member States in this treaty increases the hope of its success. It can only succeed in its objectives, however, if it is accorded universal adherence and complete implementation. Member States must fully implement the Treaty in order to halt the horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons. They must also impose a limitation on the production of offensive and defensive strategic nuclear armaments so as to check vertical proliferation of these weapons. In this connexion, complete agreement on disarmament is impossible so long as there is any major military Power and, in particular, any nuclear Power which does not subscribe to the Treaty.
115.	The Middle East continues to present a grave threat to international peace. Great efforts have been made by the Security Council, the SecretaryGeneral and his Special Representative, Ambassador Gunnar Jarring, as well as the four permanent members of the Council, but little has been achieved towards the goal of a peaceful settlement. With the worsening of the situation, a challenge has been presented to the effectiveness of the United Nations, and this has posed a serious threat to the Organization. The proposal of the United States of America for a ninety day ceasefire, which was accepted by Israel, Jordan and the United Arab Republic, brought a glimmer of hope. This cessation of hostilities in the area, though temporary, offered an opportunity for the reactivation of the Jarring mission and the possibility of a breakthrough towards a peaceful settlement. My delegation warmly welcomes these and other measures aimed at providing a just solution to the Middle East crisis and deplores all actions calculated to undermine the genuine efforts made towards a peaceful solution. Peace cannot, however, be attained in that region as long as the question of the status of the Palestinian refugees remains undecided and their condition of living continues to be unameliorated.
116.	My delegation condemns the hijacking of civilian aircraft and believes that, unless firm measures are taken by the community of nations, life and property will be continually endangered by extremists who choose this irresponsible and dangerous method to bring their personal or group grievances before the world. In this connexion, we reaffirm our support for Security Council resolution 286 (1970) and urge its speedy implementation.
117.	On a brighter note, my delegation is relieved to see an end to the internecine struggle which engaged the attention of the Nigerian Government for nearly three years. It adds to the prestige of the Organization of African Unity that early this month, at its meeting of Heads of State and Government,  reconciliation was effected between Nigeria and some other African countries which had differences of opinion with the Federal Government over the issue.
118.	In the view of my delegation, the quest for peace is matched in importance only by the problem of underdevelopment. The First United Nations Development Decade may be remembered more for its failures than for its successes, and this gives a greater urgency to the need for a more positive approach and realistic planning for the Second Development Decade. We need an acceptable global strategy involving the active cooperation of rich and poor nations alike. We need to be freed from the strangulating effects of aid with political strings. We need to redress the injustice of existing trade patterns and commodity prices to the advantage of developing countries; but these needs can only be effectively met if they are recognized not only as the needs of the developing and deprived nations but as human needs which should be the concern of the entire international community. That would require cooperation not only between rich and poor nations but among the developing countries themselves. The need for this latter type of cooperation, that is, among the developing countries, has already been recognized by our leaders at the Third Summit Conference of Non-Aligned States.  Indeed, as our Prime Minister, Dr. Siaka Stevens, said in his statement to the Assembly in Lusaka:
' 'We may not be able to lift ourselves by our own boot-strings but we may find that by joining all our boot-strings together we have woven a rope ladder for economic emancipation.'
119.	The point to be emphasized now is that we require, as an indispensable catalyst, the willing and active cooperation of the industrialized world in order that the development drive may finally be launched on an irreversible upward thrust.
120.	There is for instance a marked absence or shortage of capital in developing countries while the developed nations are sometimes choking with surplus capital, which eventually finds its way into the so-called defense budgets of countries whose greatest need may not be military hardware but agricultural improvement. It is a tragedy of our times that this should be so or that millions of valuable dollars, francs or rubles should be dissipated in prestigious space adventures when a minute fraction of this expenditure could relieve the miseries of millions by providing them with the barest necessities for survival.
121.	Again, although in the First United Nations Development Decade the exports from developing countries rose by more than six per cent, the effect of this growth is neutralized by the great expansion in the trade of the developed countries and the increased price of their manufactured products. These factors, coupled with the controlled decline in the prices of the products of developing countries, have resulted in a disappointing decrease in the earning capacity of the poorer nations. There has thus been a decline in their overall growth rate.
122.	Furthermore, by building tariff barriers and knitting themselves into protective trading groups, the developed countries often prevent the products of developing countries from gaining access to their markets.
123.	If these nega tive tactics continue to be employed by the economically advanced nations to thwart the legitimate aspirations and strenuous efforts of the third world, the Second Development Decade will soon share with the First Development Decade the inglorious title 'The Decades of Disappointment'.
124.	In the area of development aid, much emphasis has rightly been placed on its being channeled through international institutions to make it fully effective. In this exercise, institutions like the International Bank
u Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non Aligned Countries held at Lusaka, Zambia, from 8 to 10 September 1970.
for Reconstruction and Development, the International Monetary Fund and even regional institutions like the African Development Bank have an invaluable part to play. It is our view, however, that for development planning to be truly international, objective and productive, the United Nations system itself, including its specialized agencies, should play a central and vital role. It should therefore be our duty, in proclaiming the Second Development Decade, to ensure that the United Nations continues to be the major organ for international development, with its role not only expanded but strengthened.
125.	My delegation further hopes that all nations will take appropriate action both'at the national and international levels, as part of a global strategy, to help husband the world's human and physical resources. Population growth and its variety of concomitant problems such as living standards of poor countries and the aggravating problem of pollution of the environment, particularly in more advanced countries, should be given careful attention. The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment to be held in Stockholm in 1972 could provide very useful first steps towards finding ways and means of putting an end to the despoliation of our natural resources and the consequent danger to life.
126.	At this stage, I can do no more than pledge the support of my Government in the pursuit of the two major goals which preoccupy our minds and we hope that all nations will join in the effort to make the seventies the Decade of Disarmament and Development or, in more human terms, the Decade of Peace and Plenty.
127.	Among the many other problems which have engaged the attention of this Organization during the past two and a half decades, perhaps the most persistent has been and still is that of decolonization. It is a sad commentary on international relations that on the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, forty-five territories with some 28 million inhabitants still remain under colonial rule. Southern Africa presents the United Nations with the most pernicious example of this phenomenon. The illegal Racist minority regime of Ian Smith continues to defy both the administering Power and world public opinion. Earlier this year, it crystallized its defiance even further by proclaiming a so-called Republic on the basis of an illegal constitution, The Security Council, in response, has adopted further measures against Southern Rhodesia, including extension of economic sanctions, the interruption of any existing means of transportation to and from that territory and a ban on all representation there. At the same time, however, evasions of sanctions continue either as a result of insufficient vigilance by certain Powers, or lack of cooperation on the part of others. South Africa and Portugal continue to maintain relations with Southern Rhodesia and to allow transit of the latter's trade through the territories under their control. By failing to impose conditions which will ensure a speedy return to legality in that territory, the Government of the United Kingdom has betrayed the trust of the nonwhite masses who are now caught in Ian Smith's web of oppression and racist domination. These disillusioned masses have now resorted to an armed liberation struggle only because they were driven to extremes by desperate frustration. Our only honorable course of action in the circumstance is to give them every moral and material support. We therefore urge that the United Nations, as a body, should not only express sympathy with the cause of freedom fighters but should contribute financially to their legitimate struggle for emancipation.
128.	There can be no greater commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples than by the setting up of a colonial liberation fund by the United Nations. We expect the voice of Portugal in particular to be raised in vigorous protest against this suggestion, but surely it must see this as the inevitable consequence of its own blind intransigence in rejecting the principle of self-determination and in reaffirming its determination to dominate by force of arms a people struggling to be free. Repeated persuasion has gone unheeded. It has rejected the restrained proposal contained in the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa which called for a peaceful transfer of power to the peoples in the territories under its administration. It has instead continued with the escalation of military activities against the liberation movements. It has embarked on a policy of large-scale resettlement of the local population and in the process has violated the sovereignty of neighboring African States in order to 'punish' the African nationalists who have sometimes crossed their borders in search of safety. Portugal and its allies are advised in their own interests that after nine years of continuous struggle in the territories of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), with no hope of victory in sight, the only sensible solution to this tragedy lies in a change of policy. My Government, dedicated to the cause of human dignity and freedom, is committed to supporting the freedom fighters in every practicable way, for we remain firm in the conviction that as long as one of our brothers remains enslaved, we are not completely free.
129.	In Namibia, notwithstanding the repeated actions of the United Nations in both the Security Council and the General Assembly, the Government of South Africa continues in its flagrant refusal to comply with the resolutions of the United Nations. It has not only refused to withdraw from the Territory, but has in fact also usurped the inalienable rights of the inhabitants and embarked on a policy of dismemberment of the territory carving it into separate 'homelands' while at the same time extending across its borders the evil policy of apartheid.
130.	My delegation welcomes the creation of the Ad Hoc SubCommittee on Namibia :t as well as the prompt action taken by the International Court of
Justice in response to the Council's request [resolution 284 (1970)] for an advisory opinion on the 'legal consequences for States of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia'. Without prejudging the issue, one can only hope that in this exercise the futility of 1966 will not be repeated.
131.	There is a tendency to concentrate on these obvious examples of colonial domination in southern Africa and to ignore those in other parts of the world. I am compelled to say here that the emancipation of all colonized Territories is of equal importance and must be pursued with equal vigor.
132.	Let me, at this point, extend an anticipatory hand of welcome and congratulations to the new State of Fiji, which will attain its independence on 10 October. We hope that in this regard history will continue to repeat itself.
133.	Closely interwoven with the issue of decolonization is the problem of human rights, for it is a self evident truth that freedom, either of the nation or of the individual, is indivisible. During the current year, the United Nations has made significant strides towards the realization of human rights. Regional seminars have been held, among which particular mention may be made of the human rights seminar on the realization of economic and social rights with particular reference to the developing countries.  That seminar, by combining two of the burning issues of our time development and human rights and by focusing the attention of developing countries on them, has been one of the landmarks of the year.
134.	In spite of this, however, overall progress in the field of human rights has been far from encouraging. Fewer that ten States have ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI)], while other existing covenants have received only halfhearted implementation. For example, no State has as yet subscribed to the optional clause which empowers individuals to submit petitions under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX)]. It is our fervent hope that this commemorative session will be made more memorable by universal support for the proposal to establish a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
135.	It is of course, idle to expect that the efforts of such a High Commissioner would succeed in removing the greatest challenge to human rights In our time. I refer to the South African situation, which has defied all the efforts of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Organization of African Unity and individual States. At the risk of painful repetition, I must reiterate my Government's deep concern over the racial policies of the South African Government.
136.	Ignoring the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, while at the same time enjoying full membership of the Organization, South Africa has continued to entrench its policy of racial segregation and suppression and no pains are spared to liquidate the opponents of apartheid. Again, as in the case of Rhodesia, the will of a determined people has now almost erupted into violent revolution, posing the threat of racial war over the entire African continent. It is in this context that we view with grave concern and uneasiness the reported intention of the British Government to resume the sale of arms to South Africa for any purpose whatsoever. For we are convinced that every item of armament made available to that regime drives another nail into the coffin of human dignity, individual freedom and the concept of human equality, and poses a real threat to international peace.
137.	As we celebrate this twenty-fifth anniversary it would not be amiss if on this occasion we should engage our minds in the serious exercise of self-examination. In our view, the United Nations continues to be mankind's main hope for consultation and consensus, for international peace and universal prosperity; but these ideals will continue to elude us unless we are prepared to undertake an honest reappraisal of its structure and functions so as to increase its effectiveness.
138.	In the years that have elapsed since its inception, the nature of its membership has changed beyond recognition and the problems with which it was designed to cope have increased both in volume and in complexity. Only a drastic restructuring can make the Organization sufficiently contemporary and universal to meet the vital needs of today. To make it truly contemporary, we believe that the younger generation should be prepared for leadership, since it is they who will ultimately assume responsibility for the affairs of the world. We therefore supported actively and fully the World Youth Assembly which took place at United Nations Headquarters in July. Youth should be exposed as early as possible to the complexity of international organizations and their problems, and should be encouraged to play a constructive role in formulating just solutions.
139.	Nor can it be described as truly universal whilst a substantial proportion of the world's population is kept outside its pale. The People's Republic of China with its 750 million people cannot be ignored indefinitely, especially when that country is a nuclear Power. The divided States of Korea, VietNam and Germany by their very absence also make our Organization so much less effective. We look forward, wherever possible, to a speedy and peaceful reunification of those countries.
140.	For two and a half decades, this Organization has grappled with a number of human problems  political, economic, social and colonial, to name a few that from time to time have tended to disrupt the ordered way of life which mankind would very much like to preserve. My delegation hopes that, in taking stock of the past, we can at the same time rededicate our countries and ourselves to the great tasks which lie ahead of this world Organization to fulfill the high ideals of the Charter.
141. Finally, we believe that it is necessary for all nations to uphold the ideals of the Charter as this is the only way we can ensure the continuance of the Organization and the survival of mankind. Only then can we pursue the goals of disarmament and development as truly universal ideals; only then can we hope
to become truly united, as one great family of man, motivated by a common humanity and inspired by the ultimate goal of pacem in terris.

"
25,1970,GBR,"110.	 Mr. President, I should like first to say how glad I am to sit under you as President in this anniversary year. It is particularly appropriate, as we pass the quarter-century mark, that our President should be the representative of a State which has contributed so much to the United Nations and to the League of Nations before it; that he should have been a delegate at San Francisco; and that he should be one who has made so great a personal contribution to the analysis of that international law of which this Organization was intended to be the prime instrument.
111.	I should also like to say what a personal pleasure it is to me, after an absence of seven years from the United Nations, to find our SecretaryGeneral still at his post. Politicians come and go; the Secretary General remains. I am bound to say that that is the right way round.
112.	In what I have to say this morning, I start again where I left off seven years ago, talking about the rule of law.
113.	The commemorative session will be the right occasion for a general review, as we look back over our achievements and our failures since 1945. Two weeks ago I did not think that I would trouble this Assembly with an assessment, in view of the fact that my Prime Minister is coming here later on. But since then the attention of the world has been captured by a horrifying series of events.
114.	They began with a week of incidents which were properly described by our SecretaryGeneral as a 'return to the law of the jungle'. He was right. In the jungle there is fear; the law men know does not exist. In the same way, all people in the world have been frightened and lawful Governments have been almost helpless in the face of violence and threats of violence which are alien to the civilized world.
115.	If they had been isolated criminal acts, these events would not have deserved our attention here. But as it is, they have come as a portent to us a glimpse of the forces of lawlessness and anarchy that still exist a reminder of how very thin is the veneer of civilization on which we reply. These events therefore demand attention here in this General Assembly, above all, because they epitomize a danger which threatens the aim of every State, the aim of the United Nations and that is that law should rule both men and nations.
116.	This Organization was created to maintain the peace of the world by collective measures, and to provide for the peaceful settlement of disputes between States. The authors of the Charter of our United Nations did foresee one of the dangers ahead. That danger was the interference by force in the internal affairs of one country by another. But one development which the authors of the Charter did not anticipate was that the peace should be threatened by armed forces outside their Government's control. The anarchy produced by force in that guise can be just as wrecking to peace as direct aggression.
117.	When I last spoke to the Assembly, I felt optimistic. It seemed to me that the cold war might be drawing to an end. I recalled a television broadcast which I had made in Moscow at Mr. Gromyko's invitation to the people of the Soviet Union, when I said that a renunciation by the Soviet Government of the use of war and force to impose a political doctrine was the key which would open the way to genuine coexistence.
118.	Looking back over those seven years, we can note that there have been some very serious setbacks to that optimism, but nevertheless it seems partially to have been justified. The new willingness to negotiate which we had then begun to perceive has continued, and through negotiation some of the darkest of the clouds which used to menace us have started to lift.
If the United States and the Soviet Union can reach agreement on limitations to their nuclear arsenals, that will be a long step forward. I say that, even as a European on whom the missiles will still be concentrated. But we hope for the success of the strategic arms limitation talks. It will not free us from the recurring nightmare of global destruction. That possibility will remain as long as States have access to the ultimate weapons. But such an agreement could slow down the growth of the means of destruction, and so give new life to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, which has up to now been almost totally frustrated. On its ability to achieve positive results much of the happiness and, it may be, the survival of man hangs.
119.	Other negotiations are taking place on issues which have threatened peace in Europe since 1945. There is the recent treaty between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany', and the Federal Republic's negotiations with its other neighbors to the East. They hold the key to constructive coexistence in Europe.
120.	The test, of course, as always, is not in words but deeds, and in that area Berlin is still the key to real coexistence. If we cannot agree to take the humanitarian step of lowering the barriers between two halves of a city, what hope is there for two halves of the European continent to live in peace? Berlin therefore will be the touchstone of the will of the peoples of Europe to achieve detente between East and West, It was in Berlin that the ordeal of 1939 to 1945 ended for Europe; and it is in Berlin that Europe is still waiting for a release from the aftermath of war and the beginning of a peace which is real.
121.	No one should underestimate the importance of such a release. Europe cannot throw stones at others. It was in wars which spread from Europe over the whole world that this Organization and its predecessor were both conceived. But a new Western Europe is emerging now, and as Mr. Schumann said here last Friday [1842nd meeting, this Europe will inevitably be more outward-looking a more powerful center of economic growth carrying a fertilizing process far outside the borders of that particular continent. That is why our negotiations in Europe have a significance for every country represented here.
122.	We must note with honesty that all these negotiations are going on outside the framework of the United Nations. Nevertheless, their importance is fundamental to us here. When our predecessors at San Francisco framed the Charter, they based their hopes of peace on the collective determination of what were then the major Powers, and there are two ways in which these hopes have since been undermined.
123.	The first, which has already been mentioned by one or two speakers this morning, is that not all the major Powers are represented in the United Nations. This has made it undoubtedly more difficult for us to tackle effectively in this forum some of the most pressing and dangerous problems that trouble the
c Signed in Moscow on 12 August 1970.
world. I am thinking as have others, and as did Mr. Schumann of China. The Chinese are increasingly involved in those very situations around the world which engage our attention here.
124.	If the representatives of Peking were seated here their influence would be greatly felt. I cannot forecast what it would mean. They could well, by the rigidity of their political doctrine, make our tasks more difficult. But they have more than many to gain from expanding trade, from prosperity and from interdependence. They could add immensely if they chose, along with the rest of us, to real coexistence. Their intentions, in the opinion of the British Government, should be put to the proof in this assembly of nations.
125.	The second disappointment for the hopes of 1945 has, very simply, been that it has so seldom been possible for the major Powers to reach a collective view on any important issue of world politics. Until now, our collective postures have at best been negative. That is why the negotiations in Helsinki, in Vienna and in Berlin are so important for us here in the United Nations. Because if the 1960s saw the beginning of an era of negotiation, the 1970s could see at last the beginning of an era of collective action for the maintenance of peace collective action based on the common desire of the most powerful nations in the world to work together for political stability and for the settlement of disputes. That opportunity is there.
126.	The authors of the Charter assumed harmony between the leading Powers. But, of course, the ink was scarcely dry on the signatures of the Charter before that hope and trust were falsified. The lesson of the years since then is unmistakable, and it is that there can be no collective action without a collective aim and a common interest. If there does begin to emerge at last, out of all the negotiations now in progress, a common interest in peace and stability, it will transform our work in the next Twenty-five years, both in the Security Council and in the Assembly of this Organization, and that transformation would immediately be reflected in the relationship between countries in many parts of the world.
127.	There is one challenge, above all, which such determination would help us to meet. Provided a balance of strength a balance of terror, if you like is kept, the old-fashioned war of the Charter is a receding threat. States are less inclined today to pursue their political objectives through alliance and ultimatum, through mobilization and declared belligerency. To this extent, one of the ideals of San Francisco is being realized, even though this has been due in part and the admission is shameful in a civilized world at this time to the fearsome growth in the destructiveness of total war.
128.	Nevertheless, in many parts of the world today men are fighting. Victims are falling to the bullet, the shell and the grenade. All too often those victims are innocent civilian bystanders, and it is not much comfort to the widow or the orphan that no war has been declared. It is time for us in this Assembly squarely to face the fundamental, unacceptable dangers of condoning those who take the law into their own hands. We must call on those who have taken up arms to lay them down and once again to submit themselves to the rule of law.
129.	There is and it will be readily perceived by this Assembly and it has been touched upon by several speakers a cruel dilemma here. For force is so dreadful a weapon in modern terms that one has to add: '... lay down their arms, even though they claim to be carrying them in the name of justice'.
130.	The Charter of the United Nations visualized this dilemma. Our predecessors insisted on the proclamation of human rights consistent with the dignity of man, of which the representatives of Gambia and Zambia both spoke just now. And it is undoubtedly our duty to do all we can by example to secure that countries practice social justice. There are today, and we have heard them mentioned, political systems where social injustice rules, and it is right that they should be exposed, whether it is suffering under communism, or suffering under apartheid, or suffering under any other of the creeds which do not square with the practices of true democracy.
131.	But the authors of the Charter perceived another and an equal truth; that if the nations tried to impose upon each other their own notions of justice and to do it by force, that would be the finish of international order. That is why an appeal to arms, except for defense against external aggression, was expressly forbidden under our rules. If that was right then, it is a hundred times more so now. For if the end can justify the means, then more and more groups of unknown men will take up arms; they will put themselves above and beyond the law and, what is more, they will put themselves above the legal Governments of countries represented here.
132.	Kidnapping and hijacking make that lesson plain and the nations must deal with them. In the case of the. hijackers, the duty of individual Governments is clear. We should all ratify the Tokyo Convention  and support the new Convention at the forthcoming Hague Conference. We should all make hijacking a crime in our own countries, and allow it to be punished by any Government in whose territory a hijacked aircraft lands. If we could agree on these and other measures which may result from the international conference now to be held, perhaps this new and dreadful illegality could be brought under control. It is, however, a most vivid and contemporary example of how force used on a small scale can spread its repercussions far and wide, and when that happens in this modem world it is almost always the innocent who are the victims.
133.	But the dangers of the overspill of force go far beyond hijacking. This week we have an example before us of how people, who act sincerely in the name of justice as they see it and take to arms, can start a bloody widespread war beyond the control of legal Governments.
134.	After Twenty- years of intolerance and bloodshed in the Middle East, the hopes of coexistence in place of belligerency began to grow. We took a British initiative, and as a result of it we have now a Security Council resolution which sets out the essential terms of a settlement. A Special Representative for the Middle East has been appointed in whom we all have full confidence. In that forum, the four Powers in New York, we in Britain are ready to play a full part. Mr. Maurice Schumann last week [ibidj gave a most penetrating analysis of this work, which was started by his Government, and so I need not repeat what he said. The world began to breathe again when, on the United States initiative which the rest of us support, a ceasefire was agreed upon.
135.	But there has been a breakdown, which could be fatal. Violations of the conditions for an end to the fighting have been alleged. I am not judging that issue today, except to say this, that the minimum basis of trust has, for the moment, been destroyed and ways must be found to repair it. Otherwise we shall get back into the situation where we were a few weeks ago, with the danger of the Middle Eastern conflict always spreading to something much wider than a battle or confrontation between Israel and Egypt.
136.	But all this ambition for the greater peace and security of the area has been overlaid by the civil war in Jordan and it is a doubly tragic development. These refugees in whose interest this Organization has worked so hard now find themselves not only in conflict with the Government of a country which has given them refuge; they are also in declared and violent opposition to a settlement whose basic elements have been endorsed by the Security Council of the United Nations.
137.	The degree of desperation to which these people have been driven is, in some way, a measure of the failure of our Organization over the years to solve this problem in which it has been so deeply engaged. But the use of force to try and solve it has already left a deep scar on Arabia.
138.	The immediate priority must be to make an end to the tragic strife in Jordan and in that context we can welcome the apparent withdrawal of foreign intervention yesterday from Jordanian soil and to ensure humanitarian treatment for all those who have been wounded or made homeless by the conflict. We are relying on the Arab Governments to achieve these minimum objectives.
139.	The larger task, though, is still before us, and the events of the past two weeks have only added to its dimensions and complexity. The surest basis for any hope of settlement in the end must still be this; that all those concerned will support our efforts here in the United Nations to achieve and guarantee a peace that will bring security and justice to those concerned.
140.	It was that consensus which so recently seemed to be bringing a settlement within our reach; it is that consensus alone which can enable the United Nations to reach any major achievement; and it is that consensus alone which can resolve the tragic history of the last generation for all the people who live in that area of violence, intolerance and hate.
141. But there is another condition which is even more fundamental and which has also been underlined this month in Jordan. The truth is, and this must be understood by the legally established Governments of the world, whether we live in Europe, or Africa, or the Americas, or Asia, that force to achieve political ends can never pay, in the modern world, a dividend in terms of justice and peace.
142. Our theme for the next Twenty-five years is fundamentally the same as the last. It is to outlaw force; it is to sustain law. And because in recent weeks we have got somewhere near to looking into the abyss of what international anarchy can mean, we must give a new sense of urgency to our counsels in the United Nations and in this Assembly.
"
25,1970,MMR,"32.	 The delegation of Burma would like first to associate itself with the profound sentiments of sorrow and sympathy that were expressed here this morning at the tragic and irreparable loss which befell the Government and people of the United Arab Republic and the Arab world as a whole, with the sudden and untimely demise of President Gamal Abdel Nasser. We wish to express to the delegation of the United Arab Republic and, through it, to the Government and people of the United Arab Republic and to the bereaved family of President Nasser our sincere and heartfelt condolences on their great loss.
33.	Mr. President, I should like to express on behalf of the delegation of Burma our deep sense of satisfaction on your election as President of the twenty-fifth regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. The delegation of Burma is confident that your wide experience in the affairs of the international community will stand you in good stead in the charge of the particularly heavy responsibilities which lie before you as President of this Assembly, and that your wise counsel will be instrumental in guiding the Assembly along constructive lines so that the process of review and reappraisal of the Organization's work, and re-dedication to its ideals in this quarter century year of its existence will be furthered in the true interests of international harmony and international cooperation.
34.	I should also like to take this opportunity to convey my delegation's warm and sincere appreciation to Her Excellency Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph who, as President of the twenty-fourth regular session, gave her distinguished services in the interests of the General Assembly and provided much of the inspiration for this commemorative year of the Organization.
35.	Though part of the work of the present session of the General Assembly will be of a commemorative nature, the General Assembly will as usual focus its attention on the substantive matters that have a bearing on the very viability and the future of the world Organization.
36.	The United Nations, founded during the concluding stages of a war of worldwide proportions, was, indeed, dedicated to the preservation of the peace and security of nations in the postwar era. However, the postwar international relations have developed in a pattern vastly different from what the founders of the Organization had envisaged in 1945. The sad fact is, therefore, that the United Nations today is far from being a very effective Organization, particularly in respect of the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security; and a quarter of a century after its establishment its principal purposes have remained largely unfulfilled. The United Nations represents the corporate expression of mankind's concern for its continued existence, from out of a past largely characterized by the subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation and the unbridled threat or use of force in international relations. It would not have fallen so short of the expectations of mankind if Member States had endeavored in good faith to make the United Nations security system more effective in accordance with the Charter, instead of seeking security outside the United Nations, thereby bypassing and weakening it.
37.	Since the Charter of the United Nations was adopted, many fundamental changes have taken place in the world, and the Charter cannot be expected to remain unchanged. While the fundamental purposes and principles of the Organization need to be developed and clearly formulated to meet the needs of the present day international life, attention should be given to strengthening the Charter as appropriate. In this respect, the focus should be on the peacekeeping roles of the appropriate organs of the United Nations and the nature of, and problems attendant on, their functions.
38.	I should like to add that my delegation appreciates that, while appropriate review of the United Nations Charter will help to optimize its functional possibilities, the Charter itself merely provides a frame and a reference for coordinated action, and that it is the will of the collective membership, which must provide the impulse with which to make it work.
39.	At the present time, however, so much of the action or inaction of the United Nations depends on the attitude of the major Powers that, to a large extent, the prestige and authority of the United Nations itself as a corporate body has diminished, and the concept of the sovereign equality of States has reminded largely illusory. Problems which confront the international community these days are problems which, by and large, concern all Members of the United Nations, and therefore the legitimate interests and points of view of all Member States should be reflected in determining the nature of actions taken in the name of the United Nations.
40.	The delegation of Burma considers that the Charter of the United Nations provides a generally acceptable structure or pattern for friendly relations and cooperation among States for the common good of the international community as a whole. It is true that many Members of the Organization have membership also in groups and organizations, both formal and informal, ad hoc and permanent, outside the United Nations itself; and Burma, for one, does not dispute their sovereign right to do so. But we for our part consider our interests to be best safeguarded, and our respect for the interests of other nations most effectively manifested, by and through our membership in the United Nations and by our participation in United Nations and United Nations sponsored conferences and activities.
41.	I turn now to events which are further afield but of the utmost importance to us here. Since the mood of the General Assembly reflects in such ample measure the atmosphere attendant on specific developments in the relations between nations, it is perhaps a good augury for the work of the Assembly that we are meeting at a time when the atmosphere is perceptibly clearer over certain areas of the world. The delegation of Burma takes this opportunity to welcome the continued spirit of detente between the two superPowers and their will and concerted effort to avoid a confrontation. We note with satisfaction the talks on the limitation of strategic arms and are hopeful that these talks will yield concrete results in the not too distant future.
42.	The agreement recently concluded in Moscow between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Federal Republic of Germany is yet another welcome factor. The agreement is important, in the thinking of the delegation of Burma, in more than a purely European context, since it will remove past suspicions and help promote mutual confidence, thus creating a good framework for international peace and security.
43.	I should also like to take note of the developments in the Middle East which have brought about the standstill ceasefire agreement. The acceptance of the standstill ceasefire agreement would appear to reinforce the will for a political settlement on the basis of resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, which was adopted unanimously by the Security Council. We wish here to express our confidence that a just and equitable solution can still be formulated under the terms of that resolution. In so doing we are not unaware of the grave new threat now imperiling the peace not only of the region, but of areas far beyond it. We do not underestimate the difficulties inherent in the situation. However, we believe that a realistic approach to the problem, based on justice, will make it obvious to all concerned that there can be no real positions of strength and no alternative to a negotiated political settlement, which alone can ensure a stable and lasting peace in the region. The problem, indeed, calls for the most unremitting effort if a solution is ever to be sighted on the part of the parties to the conflict and of those other parties whose interests have involved their direct participation in seeking a settlement. The delegation of Burma is hopeful that the unmitigated violence and hostility, widespread in the region, will be replaced by, at least, mutual tolerance and that ultimately substantive discussions will be possible on the issues central to the conflict.
44.	Bright as the picture may be in other areas of the world, it is regrettable that, nevertheless, in another part of Asia developments have been so progressively retrograde that this year we have witnessed the spread of the armed conflict to envelop the whole of the IndoChina area. The danger that the conflagration which started in VietNam would engulf its neighbors, and even countries beyond, has always been present, and nations in the region will ponder the implications of this situation and the latest developments flowing from it. If the region is, indeed, to comprise independent nations with their resources and energies directed towards the welfare of their people, then it is essential that the external influences and manipulations, bordering on outright domination in some instances, be removed speedily, and each nation be permitted to pursue its destiny along lines chosen by its own people.
45.	The delegation of Burma,, deed, attaches utmost importance to the principle that no State or group of States has the right to interfere, directly or indirectly, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Today, many p local conflict we see is in a sense a 'border conflict'' because behind it lie, all the while, the deeper and ultimately decisive conflicts between more powerful outside Powers. It is, therefore, imperative to respect the inalienable right of every State to pursue its political, economic, social and cultural development, without interference in any form by another State or group of States. The use of economic, political or any other form of pressure, not uncommon today, against a State to prevent or impair the exercise of this right is a source of tension and conflict in present day international life. Experience would, however, indicate that the exercise of such forms of pressure against a State is hardly productive of good, lasting results.
46.	It would be appropriate to mention at this point that in the field of the progressive development and codification of international law pursuant to Article 13 of the Charter, the United Nations has made considerable progress. This function of the United Nations is of great importance at the present time when so many new States have recently become Members of the international community. The participation of these new States in this important and urgent work would place international law upon wider and more secure foundations. We hope that, in particular, the formulations of the seven principles of international law concerning friendly relations and cooperation among States would make it easier for these fundamental principles to be observed and applied effectively in international life, thereby contributing to the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security.
47.	I turn now to the subject of disarmament which has become, with its many-sided implications, a matter of major concern to all nations, big and small. Since 1970 marks the beginning of the Disarmament Decade, the subject of disarmament may well preempt the attention of the General Assembly this year, and it is hoped that the Assembly will, in commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary, provide an added impetus to the disarmament deliberations being conducted in Geneva and elsewhere.
48.	As to specific disarmament measures, the 1960s have some reasonable accomplishments to show in the way of collateral measures, although the vital issue of actual armaments reduction remains untouched. While placing the highest priority on nuclear disarmament, Burma welcomes collateral measures as generating mutual confidence between States and as paving the way towards the ultimate objective of bringing about international disarmament. The latest prospect for agreement in this area is the draft treaty for de-nuclearization of the seabed, submitted jointly by the Soviet Union and the United States.5 Burma attaches importance to this joint u s signifying a nuclear Power manifestation to pk . limitations on their nuclear military capabilities.
49.	Disarmament is, of course, a problem whose progress or lack of progress is subject to political factors in the international situation. From this perspective, the current strategic arms limitation talks between th major nuclear Powers are of crucial political significance. Burma welcomes the development as a sign that the major nuclear Powers are more interested now ii> a possible constructive course than they have thus far exhibited. The achievement and stabilization of a strategic balance between them can mean a reversal of the present armaments trend and the setting of the stage for more long-range solutions. Burma looks upon a comprehensive test-ban as part of the first essential major step in nuclear disarmament. and any concern on the part of the nuclear Powers should be welcomed if they help to put the world on the road to a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Burma's viewpoint with regard to nuclear tests remains the same; it hopes that all great Powers in possession of nuclear weapons can come to an early agreement for the complete cessation of nuclear-weapons tests.
50.	While bilateral agreements between the major nuclear Powers on strategic arms limitation provide an essential prerequisite for an advance in arms reduction, other measures require the expanded cooperation of the world community of nations since significant progress towards general and complete disarmament necessitates universal application of the arms control system. This is particularly true in the area of chemical and bacteriological (biological) weapons, which is open to the reach of all nations. Burma is of the view that the prohibition of these weapons will not be effective unless concerted efforts are made by all States to stop their development, production and stockpiling of these weapons in accordance with the recommendations made by the SecretaryGeneral in his report on Chemical and Bacteriological (Biological) Weapons and the Effects of their Possible Use.5
51.	Regarding a comprehensive program for the Disarmament Decade, the experience and information gained in the 1960s on problems of arms control could unquestionably be of value in furthering the objectives set out for the Decade. Such a program must have universal appeal and hold promise of success and, of necessity, develop within the framework of existing world political conditions. The preliminary stage of the program must therefore aim at relaxing international tensions and providing an international environment of confidence and stability, conducive to the formulation of meaningful arms control agreements.
52.	At the beginning of the 1960s, the major nuclear Powers came close together on the goal of general and complete disarmament and the main components of a disarmament plan. At the start of the 1970s we find them close together again on the goal of limited stabilized balance, which hopefully could be the beginning of the end of the nuclear arms race and the harbinger of a more positive phase in disarmament negotiations. Burma offers no reproach to the past decade. It looks hopefully forward to the future and welcomes the Disarmament Decade.
53.	I should like to touch very briefly on the twin anachronisms of our times, colonialism and racial discrimination. Though they are present in other parts of the world the fact that they appear in their most aggravated form in Southern Africa is not by chance. The Republic of South Africa's history in racial discrimination is to be deplored; its most recent action in colonizing Namibia only demonstrates afresh how removed it is from the world of today. Recent developments, and th^ support it has received from some Powers, have, however, only tended to strengthen its hand. The delegation of Burma appeals to all these Powers to desist from their aid to and support of the Republic of South Africa since they increase its capacity to pursue its apartheid and colonial policies.
54.	In Southern Rhodesia the regime in power continues to act against world public opinion, heedless of the resolutions of the Security Council and of the General Assembly, and this year has witnessed further consolidation in the adamant pursuit of its racist policy.
55.	As regards the Territories under Portuguese administration, the Government of Portugal has shown no sign even of relaxing its colonial oppression.
56.	The delegation of Burma considers it significant that the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations coincides with the launching of the Second United Nations Development Decade. Unlike the first Development Decade, the Second Decade will be launched with a comprehensive strategy for international development, reflecting better cooperation and coordination among United Nations bodies in the economic field. However, it must also be admitted that this international development strategy will necessarily be a delicately balanced compromise. Contributions made to the fashioning of the strategy and, what is even more important, to. its implementation, will be a test not only of the goodwill and understanding of the developed countries, but also of maturity and self discipline in economic affairs on the part of the developing countries.
57.	I cannot help referring to a great injustice being done to a large section of the world's population by denying it representation in this Organization. The exclusion of the People's Republic of China from China's seat in the United Nations is also against the interests of the Organization itself, since discussion of problems that confront the international community would be more realistic if the People's Republic of China were a party to them as a Member of the United Nations.
58.	As the General Assembly commemorates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, we must acknowledge that the United Nations has achieved a large measure of success in various fields, and that nations today are more anxious than ever before to seek to concert their efforts so as to erase the causes of conflict, to coordinate their actions so that their respective interests may be harmonized, to cooperate with each other to the end that the commonweal of mankind will be served and not imperiled.
59.	What is clear to us today is that the United Nations has not departed from the ideals set out at San Francisco. As we face the future, therefore, nations may wish to rededicate themselves with renewed determination to the ideals set out at San Francisco by practicing with more consistency the principles enshrined in the Charter.



"
25,1970,GMB,"2.	President : President of Gambia . Mr. President, permit me, first of all, to offer you my warm personal congratulations on your election as President of the Twenty-fifth regular session of the General Assembly. I have no doubt whatsoever that, with your wisdom and wealth of experience in international diplomacy, you will not only uphold the tradition of your distinguished predecessors in this high office but also guide this Assembly to even more significant achievements during this historic and important session.
3.	I have equal pleasure in conveying my sincere congratulations and thanks to your immediate predecessor, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph, whose masterly conduct of the affairs of the Twenty-fourth regular session has brought credit not only to herself but also to her great country, the Republic of Liberia, and indeed to the whole of Africa.
4.	On this memorable occasion, I should also like to pay a tribute to our SecretaryGeneral, U Thant, and to those who have preceded him in this difficult, often thankless but certainly ever important office. I wish to pay homage to the memory of the late Mr. Trygve Lie, who carried a crushing administrative and political burden during the formative years of this Organization. I pay homage also to the memory of another distinguished son of Scandinavia, Mr. Dag Hammarskjold, who served this Organization tirelessly and selflessly and finally gave up his life in the search for peace in my own continent. The United Nations is fortunate indeed in having, at this particular time in its evolution, a SecretaryGeneral of the caliber and integrity of U Thant. With a rare combination of the virtues of patience and understanding and the qualities of persistence and impartiality, he continues to enhance the image and the prestige both of our Organization and of his high office. On behalf of my Government and on my own behalf, I thank him sincerely for his indefatigable and continuing efforts in the cause of peace. Through him I wish to express my appreciation for the services of all those who assist or cooperate with him in his important and exacting task, from the governing bodies of the various specialized agencies of the United Nations to their dedicated but anonymous secretariats, not forgetting the interpreters, precis writers, security officers and other personnel, too numerous to mention individually, who are so essential to the orderly conduct of the day-to-day business of this highly complicated international machinery.5.	Twenty-five years ago, in the city of San Francisco, fifty-one sovereign independent States met to establish an international organization, to be known as the United Nations, and to approve its Charter. Since that day, the membership of the Organization has steadily risen it is sometimes said in direct proportion to its problems. My country had the honor of being admitted in 1965 as the 115th Member of the Organization, which now has a membership of 126. Those who framed our great Charter were people determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which, twice before in their lifetime, had brought untold misery, sorrow and suffering to mankind. These were people who firmly believed in the dignity and worth of man and unequal rights for all men. These were people determined to establish conditions of justice and respect for international law and order and to promote social progress and human development in an atmosphere of freedom. In their great wisdom, they declared the primary purposes of the United Nations to be: (a) to maintain international peace and security; (b) to develop friendly relations among nations, on the basis of equal rights and self determination for all peoples; (c) to achieve international cooperation in the economic, social, cultural and humanitarian fields.
6.	Let us pause for a moment, in this jubilee year of our Organization, to see how far we have traveled along the road we set ourselves a quarter of a century ago. Let us look back into our record and see whether we have kept faith with ourselves. Let us determine, if possible, where we have succeeded and where we have failed to come up to expectations, and why. In this way it may be possible to redefine our aims, to readjust our individual policies and attitudes to take account of present day realities, so that we may continue into the future, with greater success, the onerous but self-fulfilling task of promoting peace and progress on this planet.
7.	During the past Twenty-five years, mankind has gone through a series of crises and has at times come dangerously close to a cataclysm. Since the end of the last world war, events in various parts of the world have seriously affected the peace of our planet in varying degrees. The tragic sequence of events in IndoChina has left us the terrible legacy of the conflict in VietNam and now Cambodia. The problem of Palestine has precipitated the present explosive situation in the Middle East.
8.	United Nations forces had to intervene in 1950 to repel aggression in South Korea. The specter of secession raised its ugly head in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1960 and again United Nations forces had to intervene to restore the situation. Only two years ago this monster again appeared in the Federal Republic of Nigeria and caused untold misery and suffering before it was finally exterminated. Everyone of us here should remember the Cuban missile crisis which brought the world close to the brink of nuclear conflagration. The list is long and makes very depressing reading. I have not even mentioned the Suez crisis, the emergency in Malaysia and later on the confrontation with Indonesia, leading to the temporary withdrawal of that great country from this Organization. Then there was Cyprus, Hungary, Algeria and Czechoslovakia, and the list is still not complete.
9.	Those were all times when the peace and security of various parts of the world, and sometimes even of the whole world, were seriously imperiled. In all but a few, either by direct intervention, by conciliation or mediation or merely by bringing the pressure of world opinion to bear on the situation, the United Nations was instrumental in averting a catastrophe.
10.	Many a time, people have expressed disappointment in the efficacy of the United Nations. It has even been predicted, with unjustifiable pessimism, that this Organization will go the same way as its predecessor, the League of Nations. I personally shudder to think what the world would be today without the United Nations. In spite of the tremendous difficulties which are imposed by its size and the variety of its membership and in spite of its shortcomings, the United Nations remains, in my opinion, the most effective instrument for the maintenance of world peace and the promotion of understanding among nations that man has so far devised. If its record is not any more impressive than it is already, the fault is in ourselves and not in the Organization. If Member States were to approach the United Nations in the true spirit of its Charter, instead of transforming it into an ideological battlefield or a mere talking shop, the interests of mankind in general would be much better served. I have no doubt whatsoever as to the efficacy of this Organization or about the essential role which it has played and continues to play in maintaining international peace and security.
11.	The second of the primary objectives of the United Nations is to promote friendly relations among all nations of the world, on the basis of equal rights and self-determination for all peoples. Even before the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples ten years ago, this Organization was already very actively involved in the decolonization process. The prominent and crucial role played by the United Nations in the political emancipation of many former colonial territories does not require to be glossed over. The increase in the membership of the Organization since 1960 is a living memorial to the success of the campaign waged by the world body in this direction.
12.	In commemorating this great event, it would have been a fitting tribute to the splendid work of the United Nations if today we were in a position to assert that colonialism and all that went with it had been relegated to history. It is a matter of profound regret that despite repeated appeals, recommendations and resolutions, and all the resources of diplomacy, both inside and outside the United Nations, certain colonial Powers still refuse to march with the times. Africa spoke with one voice when my colleague, His Excellency El Hadj Ahmadou Ahidjo, President of the Republic of Cameroon, presented the Lusaka Manifesto  to the Twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly [1780th meeting]. In this unequivocal statement of Africa's stand on the problems of decolonization and racial discrimination in the southern part of the continent, it can be seen that the hand of friendship was being extented to Pretoria, Lisbon and Salisbury for peaceful and honorable cooperation in achieving the purpose of the Charter in that part of the world. It is a sad fact that this gesture of peace and cooperation has been spurned. Apartheid, in all its forms and manifestations, continues to plague the conscience of mankind. Minority regimes continue to impose their will on and to perpetrate nefarious deeds against the suffering majority in Southern Africa. Repressive laws are enacted daily and brutal means employed to subjugate further the peoples of South Africa, Rhodesia ana the so-called Portuguese territories in Africa, people whose only crime is their love for freedom and human dignity. neighboring African countries like Zambia, the United Republic of Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea and Senegal, which have given humanitarian assistance and succor to the distressed people of these areas, have in turn become the victims of aggression. Time is running very short. This situation cannot continue indefinitely. It is my earnest hope that before it is too late, wiser counsels will prevail in Pretoria, Salisbury and Lisbon so that it may come to be realized that the Lusaka Manifesto offers what might well be the last chance for peaceful coexistence among the races in Southern Africa.
13.	The third of the primary purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character. This part of the Charter also lays down the principle of respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms. For the attainment of these purposes, the United Nations relies on the action of the Economic and Social Council and the specialized agencies, as well as on such emanations of the Organization as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and so on.
14.	The problems hampering economic growth in the developing countries are many and varied. Many of these problems have an external source and cannot be resolved by the domestic policies of these countries. Perhaps the most acute of these problems is in the field of trade. The export trade of developing countries is largely dominated by primary products, the prices of which are very unstable. These fluctuations in export earnings restrict the extent to which developing countries can purchase capital goods and machinery from the developed countries. These fluctuations also adversely affect the capacity of developing countries to meet interest and amortization payments on foreign loans. This in turn prejudices the long term creditworthiness of developing countries which, in turn, again reduces the incentive to the flow of loan funds for development purposes. The steady deterioration in the terms of trade creates a vicious circle which the developing countries cannot break without greater assistance from the developed nations. The practical results of the First United Nations Development Decade have not been particularly encouraging. It is time that the affluent members of the international community understand that an indispensable concomitant to the realization of lasting peace and prosperity in the world is to reduce the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots' by assisting the developing countries to rise above economic stagnation and to promote their economic development. Poverty and superabundance are strange bedfellows, and the division of the world into rich and poor nations will always
 pose a threat to peace and security. I am hopeful that more determined efforts will be made during the Second United Nations Development Decade to achieve the targets set by the second session of UNCTAD. The international agreements on coffee, sugar, wheat and tin have contributed towards reducing the instability of the market prices of these commodities. The compensation schemes for fluctuations in the total earnings of developing countries, evolved by the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, including the special drawing rights, have also been great sources of help.
15.	Protective barriers and the increasing substitution of synthetics for natural materials, made possible by technological progress, constitute further major impediments in the way of developing countries. In the field of foreign aid also, administrative complications arising from tied or conditional aid especially when this is tied not only to the source of procurement but also to certain projects greatly slow down planning and development.
16.	All those problems tend to compound the numerous domestic ones which are inherent to the developing countries; problems resulting, for example, from constraints to capital formation, technical knowhow and population growth. They are nevertheless, in my opinion, not insuperable. The Lester Pearson Commission report entitled Partners in Development  and the United States Peterson report on international development  contain some constructive imaginative suggestions. I can only hope that those recommendations will not fall on deaf ears, as it is an illusion to believe that the affluent sector of the world can remain a quiet island in the midst of a stormy ocean, an oasis of prosperity in a desert of desperate poverty.
17.	I shall complete my address with a brief statement of my country's position on certain issues which will be discussed during the current session of the General Assembly.
18.	On the question of disarmament and arms control, the Gambia cannot but lend its full support to the efforts being deployed by this Organization to achieve, firstly, the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons; secondly, a partial, leading to a complete, ban on the testing of nuclear weapons, either underground, in the atmosphere or under the sea; and, thirdly, final and complete disarmament.
19.	Whilst we deplore and are rightly perturbed by the havoc and devastation of local wars, we tend to forget the ever-present threat of total annihilation by the products of our own intelligence. With modern weapons of mass destruction, the balance of power has given place to the balance of terror, but, of course, a peace based on terror is not real peace. It is right therefore that we should, if only in the interests of self-preservation, revise our ideas on this important question, and reaffirm our belief in the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means, within the meaning of the Charter of the United Nations.
20.	With regard to the Middle East, we in the Gambia believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 offers a basis for an equitable solution to this difficult problem, leading to lasting peace in that greatly disturbed area. The initiative of Mr. Rogers, United States Secretary of State, was most welcome to me and my Government at the time, as we saw in that development the first signs of hope and a desire for a settlement, particularly when the plan put forward by Mr. Rogers was accepted by the parties directly concerned in the conflict. It is to be deeply regretted that recent events and developments have brought those initiatives to a halt I hope only a temporary halt. The situation in the area, as everyone knows, tends to become more and more explosive with each passing day, and the danger of a general conflagration starting in the area is graver today than ever.
21.	We are aware that diplomatic moves are afoot, aimed at containing the situation and bringing about a detente. I therefore appeal to the great Powers to redouble their efforts in this direction. I strongly urge that all parties should refrain from any action at this time which may further aggravate the situation. I hope and pray that it will soon be possible to resume discussions under the Rogers plan, and that during those discussions the spirit of peace and brotherhood may touch the hearts of our brothers who have been locked in conflict for so long indeed, for too long and guide them to a mutually acceptable settlement which will restore peace, security, goodwill and brotherly cooperation among all the peoples of the area.
22.	On the question of the representation of China, the position of the Gambia has been enunciated several times. That position has not changed. In the first place, considering the form in which the problem has been put to this Organization, my country holds that the question of the representation of China is an important question within the meaning of rule 85 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. It is always an important matter to any Gambian delegation here to decide whether one China should be expelled from the place it occupies as an original Member of the Organization to make place for another China. The Gambia is quite satisfied that the Republic of China is a lawful Member of the United Nations. Apparently, the majority of the Members of this Organization feel the same way, as evidenced by the voting on the question of the representation of China from year to year. If the People's Republic of China wishes to apply for membership of the United Nations and agrees to accept the obligations imposed by the Charter, the Gambia like, I am sure, most other countries would consider supporting its application.
23.	Adverting to the Korean question, and dealing with this under the various aspects in which the problem has been posed in the past, I would say that the Gambia's position is as follows.
24.	Firstly, regarding the invitation aspect of the problem, our feeling is that representatives of the Republic of Korea and of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea may be invited to participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, if and only if the interested parties unconditionally and unequivocally accept beforehand the competence and the authority of the United Nations to take action in this matter within the terms of the Charter.
25.	Secondly, for so long as the precarious peace which now prevails in Korea continues, the Gambia cannot support any resolution, however worded, aimed at securing the withdrawal of the United Nations forces at present stationed in the Republic of Korea. In the opinion of my Government, those forces are legally stationed in that country as a result of a decision of this Organization which still remains valid, and we consider that those forces still play an important role in maintaining peace in that part of the world.
26.	Thirdly, as a corollary to the foregoing, the Gambia is unable to agree that the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea should be dissolved or that the United Nations should cease discussing the Korean problem. We continue to hold the view that the problem of Korea is one in which the United Nations has a legitimate interest. We consider that the ultimate aim and the final solution to the problem should be complete reunification of the two parts of the country under a popularly elected Government, following free and democratically conducted elections throughout the country, preferably under United Nations supervision.
27.	The problem of VietNam is perhaps more complex and for this reason, no doubt, has so far defied solution. The Gambia will actively support any moves to bring about an immediate end to the fighting and to create an atmosphere in which a peaceful and lasting solution could be devised. Here again, we believe that the people of VietNam, both North and South, should be given the chance to exercise a choice, free from coercion, intimidation or terror, concerning the form of government under which they would wish to live.
28.	On the question of Rhodesia, I have said in another place that considering the Smith regime had flagrantly violated and deliberately flouted all the five principles enunciated by the British Government, on the basis of which the British Government proposed to reopen negotiations it would only lend a degree of undeserved respectability to the illegal regime in Salisbury if negotiations were to be reopened. I have said that the Gambia still regards the British Government as primarily responsible for restoring legality in Rhodesia. My Government and I trust that sanctions will be maintained and further tightened, and that, if necessary, the United Nations will use force under Chapter VII, Article 42, of the Charter to put an end to this intolerable situation, which is a permanent insult to the United Nations and all that it stands for, and a direct challenge to the integrity of the Organization of African Unity and to African solidarity.
29.	Portugal persists in its pernicious doctrine that its overseas colonies are an extension of the metropolis. On this score, it continues to defy world opinion and to set at fought United Nations decisions calling on it to grant independence to its colonial Territories overseas, the so-called Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde Islands, Angola and Mozambique. The time may have come when this Organization should consider expelling Portugal under Chapter II, Article 6, of the Charter. Alternatively, or even concurrently, some action under Chapter VII, Article 42, may be called for.
30.	Apartheid in all its forms and manifestations is, sadly, still with us. First South Africa, then Portugal, and now the illegal regime in Rhodesia, continue with cynical impunity, to impose this abhorrent doctrine, this inhuman practice, on the Africans under their domination. Whatever action the international community may contemplate taking in its efforts to predicate apartheid, it is clear that such action should be directed equally against South Africa, Portugal and Rhodesia. The Gambia believes that isolating these three countries from the international community might
not be enough to achieve the desired effects. At the appropriate time, the United Nations should not hesitate to consider action under Chapter II, Article 6 expulsion or under Chapter VII, Article 42 persuasion by the use of force. In this context, my Government and I have indicated our strong opposition to the proposed sale of arms by Britain to South Africa. I do hope that the British Government will not fly in the face of world opinion by deciding on the resumption of such sales. I also strongly appeal, on humanitarian grounds, to. those countries which are still supplying arms to South Africa to refrain from doing so, as such arms would or could be used against the African majority in those 'countries.
31.	In the matter of foreign relations in general, the Gambia pursues a policy of positive nonalignment in a pragmatic sense, by which I mean that we will not identify ourselves with any particular Power bloc, military grouping or ideological doctrine. We shall, however, actively encourage, second and support any moves or efforts, from whatever quarter, to enhance peace, and to promote better understanding and cooperation among all peoples. I am proud to be able to say that the Gambia is at peace with all countries. We have no enemies that we know of, and we shall do everything in our power to make things stay that way. We believe in good neighborliness and friendly cooperation among countries for the common good, and I am sure our record in this field will stand the closest scrutiny. We believe in noninterference in the internal affairs of other sovereign States, and we hold these views and we pursue these policies because we sincerely believe that only in this way can we attain universal peace, without which there can be no true happiness.
32.	In this era of rapid advance in technology, which has witnessed the first landing of man on the moon, mankind has displayed remarkable ingenuity for creating things that could lead to his own destruction. If only a fraction of this ingenuity were diverted towards peaceful coexistence and improving conditions on this planet, mankind would be infinitely the better for it. Let us strive continuously towards an enduring peace and everlasting prosperity in the sort of world order which was envisaged by the founding father^ who drew up the Charter of the United Nations.
33.	Finally, Mr. President, I am profoundly hopeful that this Twenty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly will, under your wise and able leadership, achieve results which will redound to the credit of representatives and further strengthen man's faith and hope in this august Organization.

"
25,1970,TTO,"135.	  Before commencing my statement, I should like to refer to the untimely and tragic death of President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic. President Nasser was a great statesman and leader who had made an invaluable contribution to the progress of the third world and I wish, on behalf of the Government and people of Trinidad and Tobago, to associate myself with the eulogies so fittingly paid to him by previous speakers, and to extend to the Government and people of the United Arab Republic our sincerest condolences.
136.	It is with great pleasure and satisfaction that I extend to Ambassador Hambro, on behalf of the Government and people of Trinidad and Tobago, congratulations and best wishes on his election to the Presidency of this Assembly. My delegation pledges its full co-operation, and is confident that he will successfully guide us in the important and far-ranging discussions that lie before us.
137.	As we celebrate at this session the twenty-fifth anniversary of this Organization, it is fitting that we should give some thought to our past record so that we may draw from it such lessons as may enable us to make in the next 25 years more substantial progress in achieving the aims and objectives of the United Nations.
138.	The first major point my delegation would wish to make concerns the principle of universality. It is the view of my delegation that acceptance of this principle by all the present Members of the United Nations would contribute immensely to the usefulness of the Organization as an instrument for peace and security. If this august Assembly shares my hope that the next 25 years of its existence may see more meaningful purpose and direction in its affairs, then it is time to ensure that those States which remain outside this world body are brought into it. To attempt to shape the future without the participation of those States, representing in one instance approximately one quarter of the world's population, is to deny the Organization the greater effectiveness of which it is capable.
139.	If has now become obvious that the machinery of the Organization is out of date, and unresponsive to the changing demands of international life. We believe that it is urgently necessary to take steps to streamline our procedures, and we look forward to fruitful and constructive suggestions when we discuss the item on our agenda entitled 'Rationalization of the procedures and organization of the General Assembly'.
140.	Our esteemed Secretary-General has found it necessary to call attention to the growing tendency for States to rely on the use of force as a means of settling their international differences. Such a tendency is particularly alarming for small States such as ours which find it impossible to protect their independence and territorial integrity against larger States, which are capable of mobilizing superior forces. I wish to reiterate my country's position: Trinidad and Tobago is unequivocally opposed to the use of force in the settlement of international disputes.
141.	One approach to the task of achieving a peaceful and orderly world is through disarmament. The case for disarmament is irrefutable. Every peace-loving State, every State which is concerned with the survival of the human race, must, of necessity, lend its active support to efforts at ending the arms race and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and at reducing existing stockpiles of weapons. While it must be conceded that the United Nations has in the past made efforts to achieve this most desirable goal, the results so far have not been substantial, and we look forward to meaningful progress in this field in the not-too-distant future.
142.	Peace cannot be finally attained simply by disarmament and non-recourse to war. We cannot have real and lasting peace if there is no hope for the underdeveloped, which in today's world comprise 80 per cent of the population but have access to no more than 20 per cent of its wealth.
143.	The accelerated pace of the decolonization process in the past 25 years and the consequent increase in membership of the United Nations, from 51 Members at its inception to 126 Members at the present time, have transformed the world body in more than mere numerical terms. The United Nations has been brought face to face with the economic problems and needs for development assistance of most of the new nations in the Organization. It is to the credit of the United Nations that it has responded to the needs felt by the large majority of its Members and that increasing proportions of its attention and resources are concentrated upon programs of assistance in the field of economic and social development.
144.	It was the preoccupation of individual Governments with the problems of development, and the recognition on the part of the international community of the need for a combined attack on these problems, that led to the decision of the General Assembly on 19 December 1961 to proclaim the 1960s as the Decade of Development [resolution 1710 (XVI)]. I do not intend to speak again of the expectations that were aroused by the First Development Decade and the disappointments that ensued by the end of it. Suffice it to say that for some of us the Decade was largely characterized by innumerable studies and analyses which identified the needs but which did not result in any significant fulfillment of those needs. These innumerable studies, reports, analyses and diagnoses are the foundations on which we can and must move forward to positive action.
145.	In the Second Development Decade it is incumbent on us to arrive at concrete solutions to concrete programs. That is why Trinidad and Tobago, together with the rest of the developing world, is convinced that in the development strategy for the 1970s, we must define in quantitative terms both the goals and targets for development in the Decade as well as the requirements to be met for the realization of those goals. We must also set ourselves a clear time-table for the adoption of the required policy measures if we are not to repeat the failures of the First Development Decade.
146.	But, in the final analysis, however much opinions may differ about the nature and level of the targets to be set and the kinds of policy measures to be agreed upon in the international strategy for the Second Development Decade, it is the element of commitment, on the part of both developed and developing countries, which is crucial and indispensable to any effective approach to a concerted development effort. If this individual, mutual and reciprocal commitment to the strategy is lacking, we will have been engaged in another fruitless and wasteful exercise in formulating the development strategy for the 1970s.
147.	It is impossible to deal here with all the problems of development. I should like merely to refer specifically to some of Trinidad and Tobago's major concerns in international economic relations. We do not think it unreasonable to ask developed countries to permit entry into their markets of goods produced in developing countries on the basis of a comparative advantage in the manufacture of such goods. At the root of this problem of access to markets is the fundamental question of the division of labor between the developed and the developing countries. We recognize that developed and developing countries have a certain number of persons engaged in the same lines of production. We feel, however, that other avenues can be found more easily by the developed countries for training or retraining such people, or absorbing them in other endeavors, and that they should be phased out of operations which result in the denial of markets to developing countries making valiant efforts to diversify their economies and employ their own people. We regard this question of the international division of labor as one of the more fertile fields for the manifestation of true co-operation in the international community., As yet, the developed countries have not been prepared, on the whole, to give up minor trading advantages that may be shown not to be of real, long-term interest to the developed countries themselves.
148.	One well-known impediment to the economic development of the new nations, and a limiting factor in our trade relations, has been the fact that traditionally the developing countries have been linked not with one another but with a metropolitan Power, and we in the Caribbean, for example, were induced to compete with one another for limited benefits rather than to work together to enlarge the benefits which regional co-operation can confer. It has been one of our cardinal objectives in Trinidad and Tobago to preserve and strengthen our traditional links with the metropolitan countries, and at the same time to forge new links with our natural and immediate neighbors. Success so far is encouraging. The Caribbean Free Trade Area is functioning and the Caribbean Development Bank has begun to operate. Trinidad and Tobago will continue to seek to play a constructive role in promoting regional co-operation and closer harmony, not only between the islands of the Caribbean, but also between those islands and all our sister countries of Latin America.
149.	In his address at the opening of the Inter- American Economic and Social Council in Caracas in February this year, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, speaking of regional and hemispheric economic solidarity, made specific mention of the question of the resumption of economic relations with Cuba. On that occasion my Prime Minister suggested that Cuba should not be excluded from efforts at regional economic co-operation in the Caribbean and in Latin America. We are happy to note that at this General Assembly there has been expression of acceptance of that view.
150.	As regards financial resources for development, we in the developing countries are totally convinced of the paramount importance of the mobilization of domestic resources to supply as much as possible of our capital needs. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has promoted with substantial success, and is continuing to promote, the establishment of indigenous financial institutions. Nevertheless, because of our shortage of resources we need foreign private capital and foreign aid as adjuncts to our internal efforts, though these should never become the center-piece of our development strategy. But we in the developing countries are engaged in an attempt to redefine the relationship between the developed countries and the developing countries so as to give economic content to our political independence. For that reason, given the need for financial and technical assistance from external sources, this need is best filled if such assistance is multilateral rather than bilateral, thereby easing somewhat the restrictions which are a part of tied aid.
151.	The United Nations budget estimates for the financial year 1971 provide for sizable increases over last year's. But notwithstanding the tangible over-all budgetary increase, the tiny percentage allocated to new development projects remains virtually unchanged. I have already stated that Trinidad and Tobago favors the multilateral approach to development financing. We are therefore concerned at the more tight-fisted attitude taken by major contributors in recent times in allocating funds to international organizations.
152.	It has become commonplace to insist that the brunt of development efforts rests and must continue to rest with the developing countries themselves. We whole-heartedly agree with that principle and we are doing whatever is possible to inspire in our own people the dedication, the will and the effort needed in the development process. We wish to make the point, however, that it is in the interest of developed countries to support our efforts by adequate complementary measures, since our development will lead to stability, increased purchasing power, and therefore to a better atmosphere for trade, development and the lessening of world tension.
153.	The permanent sovereignty that States possess over their natural resources is indisputable. It is a sovereignty that is all-embracing and carries with it the totality of rights of ownership. The General Assembly, in its myriad resolutions on this subject, has expressly recognized and reaffirmed the inherent right of all States to explore, conserve and exploit their natural resources, whether those resources are on land or in the marine areas adjacent to their coasts.
154.	We are all agreed that the resources of the seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof lying beyond the limits of national jurisdiction belong to all mankind. My delegation envisages that the benefits to be derived from the exploitation of the resources of the area of the international zone will assist considerably in redressing the economic imbalances and inequities between developed and developing countries. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has nevertheless noted the warning sounded at the Geneva session of the sea-bed Committee of the con-sequences that might follow if consideration were given solely to the problem of the distribution of the benefits which may accrue from the exploitation of the marine resources, and not to all the economic and financial aspects of such exploitation as a whole. Justice demands that the exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed should be so conducted that it would not adversely affect the economy of developing countries, which are in many cases producers of commodities that are to be mined from the sea-bed and ocean floor. Over-production, with consequent market disruption and price fluctuations, could well offset any benefits developing countries may derive from the exploitation of the resources of the international sea-bed zone.
155.	An urgent need therefore arises for rational and equitable management of the area and its resources. An international regime including international machinery for the international zone must be established at an early date if that common heritage is not to be consumed by wasteful exploitation and if we are to avoid abrasive colonial-type conflicts in this area. In the absence of a balanced and comprehensive declaration of principles governing activities in the zone, peace and order are not likely to prevail in the marine environment. My delegation wishes to express its profound regret that the sea-bed Committee was unable to reach agreement at its August session in Geneva on such a declaration of principles. We participated actively in that session, and in spite of the unsatisfactory results we are nonetheless optimistic. We take comfort from the fact that on some important questions there is near agreement. What is heartening is that full agreement has been reached on the principles regarding the peaceful settlement of disputes and the promotion of scientific research.
156.	At that session also the need to strengthen the scientific research capabilities of developing countries was stressed. Training is in the view of my delegation an integral part of the process of economic development. Training of personnel from the developing countries in sea-bed operations must be an essential activity of any international machinery to be established. We strongly recommend that prior to the establishment of an international regime for the international sea-bed zone, and its subsidiary body, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic commission, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and other agencies within the United Nations family should consider intensifying, expanding and expediting their programs for the training of nationals of developing countries in the various aspects of marine science and technology.
157.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago attaches the greatest importance to this question. It is our hope that the specialized agencies will take positive action towards strengthening the scientific infrastructure of the developing countries, and we would suggest that the United .Nations Development program, in the context of the Long-Term and Expanded program of Oceanic Exploration and Research, should direct its attention to the establishment and funding of regional oceanographic institutions in the developing countries. Developing countries will be able to participate meaningfully in the international sea-bed regime when it comes into force and effect, hopefully in the near future, only if such programs for training are intensified and such oceanographic institutions established at an early date.
158.	The problems of the law of the sea are intimately interrelated. The law of the sea as it now exists is the creature of the developed countries, especially of the maritime Powers, which formulated it with their own interests in mind. Moreover, in the Conferences on the Law of the fJea held in 1958 and 1960, many of the developing countries were unable to participate, as they got their independence only in the last decade. My delegation, during the last session of the General Assembly, was one of the main proponents of the view that a new conference on the law of the sea should be convened to deal comprehensively with all the organically interrelated problems of the marine environment. In the 12 years since the adoption of the 1958 Geneva Convention rapidly developing technology has in fact made the law obsolete. These conferences did not provide substantive rules for the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the international zone. As developing countries, for far too long we have had to abide by laws made for us by the major metropolitan countries. The time has now come when we must ourselves assist in a progressive development of the law in this area. If a new conference is held to deal with these matters, a large number of the Members of this Assembly will be pronouncing themselves on these questions for the first time. For all these reasons, and especially because the problems of the law of the sea are intimately interrelated, Trinidad and Tobago supports the holding of a new conference to deal comprehensively with these matters and rejects any piecemeal approach.
159.	The importance of non-economic factors in the process of development is universally recognized. Development is as much a human and social problem as it is an economic problem. The goal of development is to assure to each and every citizen his or her full measure of human dignity by building in each country a humane and equal society with its own political, economic and cultural identity. Even if a country is economically developed, if the overwhelming majority of the citizens of that country are denied their fundamental human rights and freedoms, such a country must be deemed to have denied itself the rights and privileges enjoyed by civilized States, and free men everywhere are obliged to assist in bringing freedom to its oppressed citizens.
160.	At the third non-aligned summit conference recently held in Zambia, where I led my country's delegation, Trinidad and Tobago unreservedly endorsed the Lusaka Declaration. Trinidad and Tobago uncompromisingly asserts the right of the peoples who are not yet free, to freedom, self- determination and independence. We support the legitimate struggle of the people of southern Africa and people everywhere against the policy of apartheid and racist discrimination in their search for the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in the spirit of the United Nations Charter we demand the complete liquidation o< colonial structure wherever it exists, and more immediately in southern Africa, in Namibia, in Zimbabwe, in Angola, in Mozambique and in Guinea (Bissau).
161.	I have tried to articulate the hopes and expectations of Trinidad and Tobago as a member of the developing world. In addition to the inevitable change which the increase in the Organization's membership has brought about, the developing nations have brought to the world body a wider conception of what constitutes a threat to peace and activated the provisions of the Charter enjoining the employment of international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples. Development can take place only in an ordered community, in which inter-State relations are conducted in accordance with the rule of law. We are therefore particularly pleased to see the word 'justice', which is the mother of all good law, inscribed in the motto marking the silver jubilee of our Organization.
162.	With faith in the future of our Organization and with confidence in our ability to live up to the principles and ideals of our Charter, we look forward to the next 25 years.
"
25,1970,TGO,"39.	 Mr. President, allow me first of all to express to your distinguished predecessor, Mrs. Angie Brooks Randolph, the great satisfaction of my Government at the able manner in which she carried out her duties. By her ability, her dignity and her charm, she did honor to Africa in general and to our sister country Liberia in particular.
40.	I should like also to convey to you, Sir, the most cordial congratulations of the Government and delegation of Togo on your election to the highest office of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nation The Western European countries were very well advised indeed to present to our Assembly for unanimous election a candidate who is an experienced diplomat, and whose father was called upon to preside over the last Assembly of the League of Nations. We are convinced that, from the example set by your father and because of your great personal qualities, you will ably carry out the onerous duties that have been entrusted to you.
41.	At this time when we are celebrating the twenty- fifth anniversary of our Organization, we cannot allow the occasion to pass without addressing to our SecretaryGeneral, U Thant, and his predecessors an expression of our sincere gratitude for the work they have accomplished with devotion and with complete unselfishness to ensure that the great and noble aspirations proclaimed in the Charter are realized.
42.	twenty-five years ago the representatives of fifty one nations, learning from the lessons of past generations, adopted the Charter of the United Nations, one of the primary purposes of which is the development of friendly relations among nations founded on respect for the right of peoples to self-determination.
43.	Ten years ago, in order to give tangible meaning to that sacred principle, the General Assembly of the
United Nations solemnly adopted resolution 1514 (XV), containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.
44.	We are overjoyed and we congratulate ourselves on the fact that, owing to the combined efforts of our Organization and of the peoples that love peace and justice, many countries of Asia, South America and Africa have acceded to international sovereignty and have become members of the community of nations. However, we should not forget that at the present time some Territories still remain under the yoke of the racist and colonialist regimes of Lisbon, Pretoria and Salisbury.
45.	The question of the decolonization of the Territories under Portuguese domination constitutes, in the eyes of Africa, one of the most disquieting issues. Our continent has been humiliated by burdensome colonial demands for far too long to continue to consent to be subjugated and exploited further by another underdeveloped country. The very paradox of Portuguese colonialism is that Portugal does not have the necessary means to support its war. Yet, aided by certain countries, its accomplices, who call themselves friends of Africa, it continues unceasingly to spread terror, vandalism and death in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).
46.	We are gratified, however, at the fact that a faint glimmer of light is beginning to dawn in the conscience of a segment of Portuguese public opinion which heretofore has been ill informed on the issue. Submitting the policy of the Portuguese Government in Africa ever since 1930 to critical examination, the opposition party, the Democratic Union party, declared in September 1969: 'the right of African communities to self determination is recognized by all moral authorities in the world and is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the papal encyclicals'.
47.	However, Africa will not allow itself to be deceived. Thus it will continue the struggle against Portuguese colonialists wherever it occurs and whatever form it may take in Africa. For that reason, Togo, associating itself with those who participated in the international solidarity conference with the peoples of the Portuguese colonies, which met in Rome last June, makes a pressing appeal to the countries that are aiding Portugal in its colonial war to cease standing solidly behind it. My country endorses the resolution adopted by the Rome conference, demanding that NATO's support of Portugal should cease, that economic and military assistance by the countries friendly to Portugal should cease and, lastly, that the international organizations and the United Nations, in particular, should resolutely determine to isolate Portugal as long as it continues to flout the elementary rules of human rights and the fundamental principle of the right of peoples to self-determination contained in the Charter.
48.	Another of the most disturbing problems for Africans is that of South Africa. Despite the praiseworthy and tireless efforts that the United Nations has been making for a quarter of a century to give our Organization the universal character it should have, by working for rapprochement among all nations members of the international community without distinction as to race, religion or sex, we must note with bitterness and indignation that the key principle in the policy of one of the Members of our Organization is apartheid.
49.	For twenty-five years South Africa, which has established as a principle of Government the odious practice of racial discrimination, continues with impunity to defy the United Nations by flouting its many decisions. The racist policy of the Pretoria Government, the basis of which is the negation of the dignity of African man, is a serious challenge to our Organization and, in particular, to the African continent.
50.	It is clear that this deliberate flouting of the elementary principles contained in our Charter constitutes a deliberate threat to international peace and security. That is why the great Powers, which have the responsibility for ' maintenance of peace in the world, must finally normalize the need to invoke all measures, including the enforcement measures provided for in the Charter, in order to induce South Africa to respect its obligations to the international community.
51.	To oppose sanctions against the Government of Pretoria on the grounds that these would impose on the United Nations burdens that it cannot assume is a false issue and an abdication of its responsibilities.
52.	To resign oneself to a negative attitude because it has not been shown that the application to the Pretoria Government of enforcement measures as foreseen under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter would lead that Government to renounce apartheid, is an attitude of dangerous complicity which can only encourage the unrepentant racists of South Africa to persevere in their inhuman designs.
53.	In this connexion and to demonstrate the truth of what I am saying we should also recall the annexation pure and simple by South Africa of the international Territory of Namibia and its constant refusal to withdraw its administration from this country despite the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly.
54.	The sad experience of South Africa is dangerously being followed by the illegal regime in Salisbury. Encouraged by the example of its neighbor and reassured by the presence of the armed forces of the latter on its territory, the rebel regime of the racist minority in Rhodesia is adopting new measures to strengthen its position and to oppress the African majority even further in flagrant violation of resolution 1514 (XV) of the General Assembly.
55.	My Government solemnly appeals to Member States which are aware of the serious danger with which the total racisms of the authorities of Lisbon, Pretoria and Salisbury confront our Organization, It deplores the complicity of those States which, despite many resolutions of the Security Council, continue to maintain trade relations with South Africa. It denounces the fact that certain Member States are supplying weapons to that racist country which uses them against innocent people whose only crime is that they are fighting for their freedom. It is high time that our community decides to assume the full measure of its responsibilities so that the advocates of apartheid will understand that they can no long commit crimes 'in the name of the law' with impunity.
56.	I think I can say, however, that independent Africa is ready to receive with satisfaction the advent in southern Africa of a multiracial community based on freedom and equality. That is why, in accordance with the terms of the Lusaka Manifesto, we ask that an opportunity be given to the peoples of these States to cooperate as equal citizens and to provide themselves with the institutions and systems of Government under the protection of which., by common agreement, they will live and work together to create a harmonious society.
57.	Another longstanding problem, no less disturbing for our Organization, is that of the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations. We deplore the fact that a country whose extraordinary economic potential and demographic importance is known to our Organization still has not taken its rightful place among us. However, we note with satisfaction the efforts being made by some countries which are working unceasingly in search of an intermediate solution between the various positions which heretofore have always been in conflict in our Assembly. There is no doubt that the Chinese problem has progressed considerably in recent years towards a settlement that has been desired for many years.
58.	May I be permitted to reaffirm the position of my Government on this question? In our view, the Organization would only be doing justice to the People's Republic of China by admitting it to the Organization, and it is in the name of that same principle of justice that an opportunity should be given to Nationalist China to continue to sit amongst us.
59.	Nor can we pass over in silence the painful problem of VietNam which has been of concern to our Organization for many years. We duly appreciate the United States decision to withdraw its troops from South VietNam, and we hope that the resumption of the Paris negotiations will lead to a compromise settlement satisfactory to all of the parties concerned and will lead to a genuine peace in that part of the world where the civilian populations have been so sorely tried for so long.
60.	Turning to the problem of peace, we must note with regret that during all the time that we have been discussing disarmament, no noteworthy progress has been made and that the countries possessing atomic
weapons continue, in disregard of the poverty of the underdeveloped countries, to pour astronomical sums of money into the manufacture of instruments of destruction. It would not be fair, however, if I failed to mention the efforts made by both sides to achieve disarmament in this instance I refer to the United StatesSoviet meetings at Helsinki in December 1969 and in Vienna in April 1970. We address ourselves to the countries possessing those weapons of mass destruction with a certain degree of concern, but also with a measure of hope, the hope that in the near future we may see the negotiations for complete and effective disarmament culminate in an extension of the negotiations to all countries possessing atomic weapons.
61.	The ceasefire which has just been instituted in the Middle East should not lead us to forget the complexity of the IsraeliArab conflict.
62.	My Government has always felt that there could be no just and lasting peace in the Middle East without the effective implementation by the two parties of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967. The consistent attitude taken by my Government on this issue leads me to state that we support the latest United States peace proposal and I am referring to the Rogers Plan which as you know is not different from the resolution of 22 November 1967, both of which look towards the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from the territories occupied during the recent conflict and the recognition of the right of all countries of the region to exist. True, we can criticize the Rogers Plan for not having expressly tackled the Palestinian problem. However, it seems to us that the plan constitutes a step towards the settlement of the conflict. That is why we invite Israel and the Arab States to make a realistic appraisal of the situation and to accept this plan.
63.	The recent repeated hijackings of civil aircraft in flight and the resulting danger to the lives of the passengers prompt me to reaffirm the position of the Government of Togo on this question. We condemn these unworthy acts as a means of defending any cause whatsoever. We think that States should take early measures to implement resolution 2551 (XXIV) of the General Assembly.
64.	Turning to another question, the particular interest that my Government takes in the German problem is well known. The historical bonds of friendship which unite our two countries are for the Togolese people a reason to share the sorrow of the divided German people. Togo therefore welcomes the development of BonnEast Berlin and BonnMoscow relations. We welcome in particular the contacts between the two parts of Germany and the recent conclusion in Moscow of a treaty on the non-use of force and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.4 Our dearest wish is to see the current negotiations culminate in self-determination for the whole German people.
65.	On the eve of the Second United Nations Development Decade, and also on the tenth anniversary of my country's independence, I should like to mention the economic problems which are of concern to us and, more specifically, that of the widening gap between the economies of the industrialized and developing countries.
66.	Article 55 of our Charter sets forth the basic objectives of international economic cooperation, clearly stipulating that, among other things, the United Nations shall promote higher standards of living and conditions of economic and social progress and development.
67.	Those noble objectives led our Organization, ten years ago, to outline the work program for the first United Nations Development Decade, to whose disappointing results we cannot remain indifferent. Within
framework of the first Decade, each developing country was supposed to fix its growth rate, taking as its target a minimum annual growth rate of 5 per cent, to be reached by the end of the first ten-year period.
68.	Unfortunately, the economic achievements of most African countries have been very disappointing during the period concerned.
69.	We must also note with those at the head of international economic bodies that the target of 1 per cent of the gross national product of the wealthy countries as assistance for the developing countries, which was accepted at the second session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  and which has just been approved by the Preparatory Committee for the Second Decade, is far from having been attained. In 1969 the wealthy countries devoted to the third world only 0.72 per cent of their national income, as compared with 0.79 per cent in 1968. The percentage devoted by the world's wealthiest country has even declined from 0.66 to 0.49 per cent. We sincerely regret this sad reality. On the other hand, my country welcomes the substantial assistance afforded it by certain countries, in particular France and West Germany.
70.	We must therefore consider what are the causes of this failure, so as to make sure the Second Decade does not suffer the same fate as the first. Many reasons may be found; but the most important is undoubtedly the non-binding nature of the resolution., and recommendations adopted, which, unfortunately, are all too often no more than a catalog of good intentions. The developing countries thus have the feeling that the developed countries, which are in part responsible for the success of the measures advocated, are wanting in political will. Even when the political will exists  and in the euphoria of debate one might sometimes suppose that it does one must wonder whether ultimately the non-binding nature of the commitments entered into does not contribute to blunting and opposing it.
71.	The success of the Second Decade will depend, above all, on a sincere desire to extend effective assistance in the takeoff of the developing countries' economies; but here too we need something more than vague recommendations. As regards the form of those commitments, if the Second Decade is to be more successful than the first, it is essential that clearcut action programs should be drawn up in specific sectors and that definite commitments should be entered into, which might apply to sectors concerning primary commodities, and development programs in particular.
72.	To lose sight of the fact that primary commodities constitute the essential resources of the developing countries would be a grave omission. Among the measures envisaged for the Second Decade the developed countries should undertake to promote the conclusion of international agreements on the more important commodities. On this subject, my country welcomes the success of the Conference of cocoa producing countries which was held at Lome late in March this year. We earnestly hone that the concrete results achieved will persuade the consumer countries of our determination to conclude an international agreement on that commodity.
73.	If specific commitments should be undertaken in the field of trade, particularly as regards primary commodities, the same applies to development programs, whose implementation will bring the targets of the Second Decade within reach. Specific obligations should be entered into by the developed countries. Although the 1 per cent target is not sufficient to bring about spectacular results, it constitutes a minimum.
74.	At the present time the aid distributing agencies are unable for want of resources to meet all the requests for financing often thoroughly justified requests  which are made of them. Here again, the existence of political will in the developed countries should make it possible to find the necessary financial resources.
75.	But over and above this political will and the obligations which flow from it, it is essential to mobilize public opinion in those countries where people do not always understand the meaning of the* effort which is asked of them, to explain to them the interdependence of the problems of today's world as a result of which the prosperity of countries which are today poor constitute for the wealthy countries an incentive for sustained development and also a guarantee of international peace. This would help to exorcise the demon of Cartierism and to inform public opinion, too long misled, in greater depth.
76.	I have mentioned the problems of the Second Development Decade and what, to us, seem to be some of the more essential measures. These measures would have their full effect and would enable the wealthy countries better to discharge their commitments if thousands of millions of dollars were not spent on ruinous and unproductive wars and if the Powers and superPowers of this world had not hurled themselves into the mad arms race, an arms race that is all the crazier since we are told that those arms will not have to be
7
used. Many voices have been raised at this rostrum deploring the fact, and it is time the race to build instruments of death gave place to the race to develop the potentialities of men. That is possible only if the peoples and leaders of wealthy countries are moved by a spirit of global solidarity.
77.	We believe that present day youth's resolve to participate more fully in the activities of our Organization may be nourished by this spirit of solidarity and thus be brought to play an important role in bringing peoples together and in the economic and social development of the third world. We thus share the opinion of our SecretaryGeneral who, when opening the World Youth Assembly  in this very chamber some while ago, called for the creation and spread of a new kind of patriotism, a patriotism of man, so as to spread the spirit which we so desperately need if our international institutions are to function.
78.	Young people throughout the world can understand this appeal. United, they can represent a new force. But it is also for us, the political leaders, to take courageous decisions and to set an example by giving young people the material means of action. My government, therefore, entirely supports our SecretaryGeneral's idea of creating a United Nations corps of young volunteers to participate in the economic and social development of the underdeveloped countries. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the developed countries which have already set up national corps of young volunteers to assist our countries in the most varied fields.
79.	The problems I have referred to are intimately interrelated and, naturally, lead me to speak of hunger in the world that anomalous and destructive scourge in our century of advanced science and technology. The situation is so serious in some parts of the world that it should prick the conscience of the most selfish; they must realize that the imbalance in economic and social conditions operates mainly for the benefit of the people in wealthy countries and to the detriment of the poorest peoples in the world. Like the Director General of FAO, we believe that there is little time left in which to change our attitudes about the vital problems of the third world if we are to avoid an absolutely overwhelming tidal wave of violence. According to the most modest estimates, the total world population in the year 2000 will be about 6,000 million, of which 4,000 million will be in the third world. That is why we firmly believe that our chance of survival rests in increasing assistance, in capital investment and in reexamining terms of trade. The action of the World Food program, considerable though it may be, needs to be substantially strengthened.
80.	While it would be unjust to say that the balance sheet of our Organization after twenty-five years of existence is negative, it must also be recognized that the hopes of our peoples have not been entirely satisfied. Peoples on our earth are still torn by pointless wars, subjected to abominable injustices and oppressed by inhuman practices.
81.	The effectiveness of our Organization depends, first and foremost, on the authority that States Members are willing to confer upon it. But such authority means that all nations, great and small, must put their faith in the Organization. That is the price of a solution to our problems.
82.	In conclusion, may I proclaim here, as we embark upon a new quarter of a century of our Organization's life, that my country, once a ward of the United Nations, intends to contribute, with all its energy and with renewed faith, to helping usher in a new society of peace, justice and progress.
"
25,1970,HND,"153.	  This session of the General Assembly which we are now beginning has, as has already been said, a special and far-reaching importance. For the first time in history an international organization of this kind has reached the celebration of 25 years of its existence.
154.	It is a happy augury for the development of our work to have you as the President of the Assembly, sir, not only because of your personal qualifications but also because you represent a country which is a paradigm of the legal, political and social values which
should serve 
the world of today. We extend to you, Mr. President, the sincere congratulations and the best wishes of my delegation on your welldeserved election.
155.	My country has felt deeply sorrowful on hear.ng of the death of His Excellency President Gamal Abdel Nasser, which occurred yesterday since he was the Head of State of a people with which we have always maintained friendly and cordial relations.
156.	We cannot but regret the death of a leader of such worldwide importance as was President Nasser, who always fought indefatigably for the improvement and wellbeing of his fellow citizens. On this painful occasion I should like to extend to the delegation of the United Arab Republic the sincere feelings of condolences of the Government and people of Honduras.
157.	To say that the United Nations has completed 25 years of existence implies something more than merely celebrating its silver anniversary. I believe that now among all the feelings which nest in our hearts ; the dominant one, the one which cannot be concealed, j is the feeling of astonished and surprised joy. Nor could I it have been otherwise. For those of us who saw this j Organization being born out of the ruins of a devastated j world destroyed b 'the largest conflagration which man I has ever brought about; for those of us who saw its I hesitant first steps and the constant crises which have I threatened its existence, it cannot but be a cause for j amazement, but also of pride, that the Organization j has managed to survive.
158.	In itself, mere survival would be a source for optimism and faith in the future of mankind. However, the United Nations has not limited itself to mere survival but, through its various organs, it has struggled steadfastly to bring into being a better material and spiritual world.
159.	Often, on comparing what was achieved, with the objectives of the San Francisco Charter, we bring to light the shortcomings, deliberately ignoring the reasons which brought them about and which are to be imputed to its Members large or small. Such a recognition, although the results may fail to measure up exactly to our expectations, will be more than sufficient to make visible to the eyes of the world the efficiency of this world forum.
160.	A proof of the faith which the United Nations principles inspire is the substantial increase in the number of its Members. To the 51 States which signed the San Francisco Charter, 75 have been added, thus raising the membership to 126. Such an increase, as I said, is encouraging.
161.	Honduras, consistent with its tradition of legal and peaceful coexistence with all States, has attended the meetings which are intended to bring normalcy to the Central American region, and has been prepared to participate in a constructive dialog, conscious that peace in Central America is a precious heritage which we must restore for the benefit of our peoples.
162.	A year ago, with strong feelings which were then warranted, I denounced before this Assembly the armed conflict which a neighboring country imposed on mine. Today, although all the wounds have not yet been healed, I have come to give an account of the progress achieved in the process of bringing peace between both States.
163.	In December 1969 the Ministers of External Affairs of the Central American countries met in the city of Managua with the intention of bringing about normalcy in the Central American area. Realizing that these lofty objectives require the sincere cooperation of all States, we reaffirmed the decision of our Government to settle the conflicts which might arise between us in accordance with the rules of law. We also expressed the hope that the consequences of the conflict I mentioned would be resolved satisfactorily by means of bilateral negotiations between the parties directly concerned.
164.	For that purpose, a bilateral working group was set up composed of representatives of Honduras and
El Salvador, which was to study formulas which would make it possible to reach an overall solution to the conflict. I am happy to be able to inform this Assembly that this Group, whose moderator was the skillful diplomat and illustrious former SecretaryGeneral of the Organization of American States, Dr. Jose A. Mora, who was designated by the present SecretaryGeneral of the same organization with the consensus of the member parties, is carrying out its work in a satisfactory manner.
165.	After protracted discussions in the regional organization, we were able to establish, by an agreement signed at San Jose, Costa Rica, a security zone for the purpose of pacification of the Honduran Salvadorean frontier, which, no doubt, constituted the first step in the lengthy and arduous process of achieving the future reestablishment of peace in the area.
166.	To achieve final peace is a lengthy and arduous process. It would be Utopian to expect that overnight things would revert to what they were prior to the conflict. That is why my Government has set for itself as an immediate goal the attainment of peaceful and respectful coexistence with El Salvador. I reaffirm here that even this limited objective cannot be attained until there is a demarcation of the frontier between the two countries. This claim which my country makes is no whim nor caprice; it is nothing more than the adequate means to give effect to the well-known and universal words of Benito Juarez, namely,'Peace is respect for the rights of others'. Unless one knows the extent of those rights, it is elementary logic to conclude that peace will always be precarious.
167.	On this occasion my Government once again affirms its faith that the law will prevail as a standard for international coexistence and that compliance with it by other countries will bring us to total normalcy in the Central American area.
168.	During the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly I reported on the direct negotiations which were then being held between my country and the United States of America, regarding recognition of the sovereign right of Honduras over the islands of Santanilla or Swan Islands. I can affirm today with genuine satisfaction that the enlightened Government of the United States in a gesture which adds much to its stature, in a note dated 12 November 1969 stated that it is prepared to recognize the sovereignty of Honduras over these islands I mentioned. I cannot fail to express my hope that all countries which still have conflicts of sovereignty over some territories will be able to find a solution similar to the one which we obtained in this case, which is an example of the fact that legal equality among States exists, as well as understanding and friendship among nations.
169.	On commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in the historic General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), we regret that its objectives have not been fully attained and that there are still colonial systems whose presence could not be justified in any era, least of all now. We condemn all forms of discrimination, whether on grounds of race, religion, origin or sex, wherever they exist, no matter by whom or against whom they are committed.
170.	Honduras believes that it is of vital importance to select more realistic standards, more in accord with technological advances, in regard to the law of the sea. The proper utilization of natural resources, within the right of every State to dispose of its natural resources, is basic for the immediate future of the developing countries.
171.	Our country, under our constitutional mandate, has established at present a twelve-mile limit for its territorial seas; we also reserve our rights over the seabed and the subsoil of the submarine shelf, the continental and coastal shelves and other submarine areas adjacent to our territory and beyond the territorial sea to a depth of 200 meters or to a depth-limit at which the exploitation of the natural resources of the seabed and the ocean floor is possible.
172.	Honduras attended a conference at Lima, Peru, in August last, and, being aware of our responsibilities to our people and to mankind, we signed a historic declaration in which States proclaimed, as general rules of the law of the sea, that we shall determine our maritime jurisdiction in accordance with geographical requirements and the need rationally to use the resources and the exploration, exploitation and conservation of the natural resources in the seas adjacent to our coasts and' in the soil and subsoil thereof.
173.	It is painful to observe that the situation in the Middle East, far from improving, continues to be a focus of violence which might well constitute the origin of a world catastrophe. My delegation, as on past occasions, unreservedly supports the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and by the Security Council of the United Nations, and we trust that wisdom will prevail among the leaders of the various sides, thus avoiding the spread of a conflict which, without any exaggeration, could lead to the destruction of mankind.
174.	It would seem that the ability of mankind to devise new forms of violence is inexhaustible. For some time now, two particularly repugnant crimes have become typical: the hijacking of persons and of aircraft. While in both cases ideological reasons are invoked, the standards of freedom and personal security and the principles enshrined by tradition and by international conventions are violated. Despite the fact that both the Security Council [resolution 286 (1970)] and the Organization of American States have vehemently condemned those two crimes and have described them as crimes against mankind, we realize and must say without circumlocution that, as long as there are Governments which give sanctuary to air pirates and view those criminals as patriots, any effort to prevent their wrong doing will be totally useless. It is necessary to give up ideological attitudes which are out of place when confronting systematic crimes and to adopt, individually or collectively, the most drastic measures which the law will allow, so as to prevent the continued mockery of justice with impunity and the sacrifice of innocent lives.
175.	It has been recognized that there is a close interdependence between foreign trade and the rate of economic development. In Latin America we have expressed our points of view on the subject in the Vina del Mar Declaration, which was adopted at the last meeting of the InterAmerican Economic and Social Council.16 In that document it was resolved at the ministerial level to request His Excellency Mr. Gabriel Valdez, Foreign Minister of Chile, President of the Special Session, together with the Ambassadors of member countries accredited to the Government of the United States of America, to deliver to His Excellency Mr. Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States of America, the document signed at that meeting with a view to establishing the procedure to continue the dialog and the negotiations between the Latin American countries and the United States, so as to achieve a readjustment of the termS of trade, which at present have fatal consequences for countries which export raw materials. We optimistically hope that in the near future positive solutions will be found to reduce the obstacles now being applied to Latin American exports. In this way we shall once again strengthen the inherent personality of the American continent, enhance the traditional forum of cooperation and friendship which has prevailed among all nations, as a logical consequence of the historical process of this hemisphere and promote the creation of a consciousness molded on their common interests.
176.	In the field of finance in international economic relations, the effects of the deterioration in the prices of raw materials are felt more keenly as time goes on and in contrast, the prices of imported manufactured goods rise continuously. This is reflected in persistent imbalances in the balance of payments of the underdeveloped countries. The circumstance is a secondary consequence, in so far as Latin America is concerned, of the barriers to trade imposed by the highly industrialized countries, from which it follows that redress of the latter is closely linked to the former; that is to say, that the liberalization of international trade is a sine qua non condition to put an end to the financial imbalances with which our countries are afflicted. In this field, the underdeveloped countries maintain our hope that we shall continue to have the support of the tenacious and indefatigable work of the United Nations and its respective specialized agencies, as well as the efforts of our own continental and regional organizations themselves.
177.	In international forums, we are already beginning to hear about items which refer to the constant weakening of the world financial system. In the recent past, the basis for international financial stability was monetary discipline, to which the signatory nations to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund committed themselves. Nevertheless, while a growing number of nations agreed to this
15 Latin American consensus adopted by the Special Commission on LatinAmerican Coordination on 17 May 1969.
10 Held at Caracas, Venezuela, from 3 to 6 February 1970.
rationalization by applying internal measures, others, possibly because of the obligations of national and international multiple commitments, fail to apply what has been called 'monetary discipline' and exercise a broad discretion, even though their decisions are detrimental not only to their own economies but also, as a consequence, to the economies of other nations. That is what was recently said by the Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund in Copenhagen, on the twenty-first of this month, at a press conference which he held on the subject.
178.	Moreover, in April 1970, in Vina del Mar, Chile, at the seventh meeting of the Governors of Central Banks of the American Continent, it was emphasized that possibly due to political, economic and social reasons which could brook no delay, several nations may find themselves compelled to exercise greater freedom of action in their monetary and financial policies. It may then be seen that it is appropriate to look to a renewal of confidence in the self-discipline of nations, to prevent us from falling once again into the economic stagnation and the financial chaos of 1930, which was the precursor of the Second World War.
179.	I confess that the present world picture is not conducive to optimism about the future. Nevertheless, as my delegation stated during the nineteenth session of the General Assembly [1304th meeting], not all is gloom and despair. Among the four mythical horses of the Apocalypse, and to the extent that our human condition permits it, we are to a greater or lesser extent overcoming three of them: hunger, pestilence and death. The only one which rides un-intimidated is the most nefarious of them all: war. Let us therefore devote all our efforts, use all the means which science and technology place at our disposal, to eliminate the intolerance which leads to war, if not as a moral mandate in regard to our fellow citizens, at least as an expression of a mere instinct for self-preservation. That is my hope. It is also the hope of mankind.

"
25,1970,UKR,"130.	  Mr. President, I should like to offer my congratulations to Mr. Hambro on his election to the responsible post of President of the twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly and wish him success in discharging this important mission.
131.	Speaking from this rostrum for the first time, I should like to extend my greetings to you, Mr. SecretaryGeneral. The great efforts which you are making for the fruitful activity of our Organization are universally known.
132.	The delegation of the Soviet Ukraine has learned with profound sorrow of the untimely death of that outstanding political figure and statesman, Mr. Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of the United Arab Republic. On behalf of the Government and people of the Ukraine, we wish to convey our very sincere condolences to the Government and people of the United Arab Republic and to the family of the deceased. Gamal Abdel Nasser will remain in our memory as a tireless champion of the just cause of peoples fighting for their freedom and independence and as a steadfast advocate of the strengthening of friendship and the development of cooperation in every possible way between the people of the United Arab Republic and the peoples of the Soviet Union.
133.	Our purpose in evaluating the work done by the United Nations over the past quarter of a century is to learn the necessary lessons and to do everything possible to ensure that the United Nations becomes a really effective and reliable instrument for strengthening international peace and security and cooperation between States and peoples in every possible field.
134.	At the time of its establishment, the United Nations proclaimed the truly democratic objectives of safeguarding universal peace and the security of peoples by all possible means. The fact that 25 years have passed without a world war does certainly do some credit to our Organization.
135.	Nevertheless, we are still living in conditions in which dangerous tension exists, the arms race is still going on and conflicts fraught with dangerous consequences occur from time to time.
136.	The complex nature of the international situation confronts each session of the General Assembly with a multitude of problems. Many of them will have to be considered at the twenty-fifth session also. There is no doubt, however, that we must concentrate our attention on questions which are decisive for the fate of world peace and, consequently, for the future of the United Nations.
137.	In this connexion we should like to recall that the Government of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, in its reply to the SecretaryGeneral on tKe question of international security [see Al7922lAdd.2] expressed the view that the development of international relations in recent times urgently required that the United Nations should intensify its efforts to solve fundamental political problems, primarily those of strengthening peace and security. This means that the United Nations must take effective steps to eliminate hotbeds of armed conflicts, to stop the use of force against national liberation movements, to put an end to the seizure and military occupation of the territory of other States, to halt the continuing arms race and to bring about agreement on general and complete disarmament.
138.	The delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic believes that, on the occasion of its twenty- fifth anniversary, the United Nations should approve a political document setting out a program for the strengthening of international security. We are convinced that the draft declaration on the strengthening of international security [AlC.llL.513] submitted by the delegations of the socialist countries could well serve as such a document. Practical measures to give effect to it will be in the interests of all States, large and small.
139.	The year which has elapsed since the last session of the Assembly has been marked by certain favorable changes in the international political climate. There is increasing awareness of the need to solve controversial problems by negotiation and to recognize the realities of the modern world. And when we speak of favorable trends of this kind, we are referring primarily to the European continent.
140.	The special interest of the Ukraine in the strengthening of European security hardly requires explanation. Facts illustrating the truly terrible consequences of wars, for the Ukrainian people   particularly the consequences of the war unleashed by Hitlerism   have repeatedly been cited from this rostrum. It is therefore easy to understand the genuine satisfaction with which our people supports any practical proposal, any reasonable initiative, aimed at ensuring peace in Europe.
141.	At the same time, our position cannot in any way be interpreted as a position based on narrow national interests. In a recent speech Comrade Shelest, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party, quite rightly pointed out, as reported in the Ukrainian Pravda of 18 April 1970, that:
'The processes which are taking place in Europe to a greater or lesser extent determine the direction and nature of the development of events in all parts of the world. That is why European problems have a truly worldwide significance and European security is rightly regarded as a key issue in world politics.'
142.	The world is indivisible. That was true yesterday, and it is particularly true today.
143.	The people and Government of the Soviet Ukraine warmly approve of the proposal to prepare and convene a panEuropean conference on questions of security and cooperation.
144.	It is common knowledge that the countries parties to the Warsaw Treaty have advanced some specific proposals regarding the agenda for the pan European conference and the preparations for it. We consider these proposals to be important and highly constructive. A characteristic feature of these proposals is that they relate to the problem of the security of all European States without exception. They take into account the positions of States which are interested in the establishment of lasting peace in Europe, and they create very favorable conditions for the practical preparations for the panEuropean conference.
145.	From the point of view of strengthening European security, the signature of the treaty between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany in Moscow on 12 August this year is most encouraging. The treaty is based on the realities of our time, rejects absurd attempts to revise the results of the Second World War and recognizes as inviolable the Oder Neisse frontier and the frontier between the two German States.
146.	It was the entire development of European realities which paved the way for this treaty, and its significance certainly extends far beyond the context of bilateral relations. It will undoubtedly play an important part in improving the international situation. This point has, in fact, already been mentioned by many speakers in this debate.
147.	The Ukrainian people regard the conclusion of this treaty as the result of the creative, consistent, peace-loving Leninist foreign policy of the Soviet Union. This extremely significant event further strengthens our conviction that, in spite of differences in social systems and membership of opposing military and political alliances, peaceful coexistence and peaceful cooperation between States are both necessary and realistic.
148.	Speaking of the possible consequences of the changes which have taken place very recently on the European continent, we believe that the day is drawing near when, in the words of the President of France, quoted here by Mr. Schumann [1842nd meeting] 'all Europe' will be represented in our Organization.
149.	In this connexion, the simultaneous admission of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations is a long overdue requirement of European and international cooperation. Indeed, the German Democratic Republic now maintains diplomatic relations with 25 countries and other relations at the Government level with another 18 countries, which together account for 60 per cent of the world's population. A positive solution to the problem of the admission of the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations would undoubtedly be a manifestation of political realism. It would help to ensure the universality of the United Nations, which is an essential prerequisite for improving its activities.
150.	When we speak of the need to strengthen international security, we cannot ignore the fact that the aggressive forces of imperialism are not shrinking from any available means to aggravate international tension and create dangerous hotbeds of military conflicts which threaten to expand into a new world war.
151.	One example of this is the present situation in the Middle East, which is passing through one of the most dramatic and difficult periods in its history.
152.	The legitimate struggle of the Arab countries against Israeli aggression and for the elimination of its consequences clearly demonstrates the futility of the policy of acting from a position of strength, a policy which is being pursued by Israel and encouraged by certain imperialistic circles.
153.	The basis for settling the Middle East crisis is well known: it is the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967 [242 (1967)].
154.	The temporary ceasefire and the resumption of the conciliation mission of the Special Representative of the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Gunnar Jarring, were encouraging steps, made possible mainly by the peace-loving and constructive attitude of the United Arab Republic.
155.	But the noble mission of the United Nations is in fact being blocked and undermined by the obstructive action of Israel, which is supported by influential circles in the United States and certain other countries. The imperialist forces are now using every possible pretext to aggravate the situation and are counting on fostering discord between individual Arab States. They are trying to use the outbreaks of civil dissension in
Jordan for their own sordid ends and are threatening direct armed interference.
156.	In these circumstances, the delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic would like to point out that all peace-loving forces must maintain a high degree of vigilance and firmness, in order to prevent outside armed interference in the affairs of the Arab countries and to accomplish a peaceful political settlement in the Middle East.
157.	We express the hope that their tragic loss will not break the will of the people of the United Arab Republic and of other Arab peoples to strengthen their unity on an anti-imperialistic basis. This will help their just and legitimate struggle for independence and territorial integrity, for the elimination of the consequences of Israeli aggression and for the establishment of a lasting peace in the Middle East.
158.	The serious consequences of the continued aggression by the United States of America in VietNam are well known. For the past quarter of a century, the VietNamese people has not known what peace is. The Paris conference is now in its twentieth month, and yet the aggression of the United States of America is not only continuing, but has spread to Laos and Cambodia.
159.	However, neither the notorious 'Viet Namization', nor the Cambodian adventure nor the gross intervention in Laos will produce the desired results for the aggressor, who is sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of a' 'dirty war''. The peoples of Indo-China are more anxious than anyone else for the restoration of peace in their land as soon as possible, but they are legitimately demanding that this should be a peace under conditions of independence and freedom, without any outside interference.
160.	The liberation struggle of the peoples of Indo-China enjoys the resolute support of our country and of all progressive mankind. The United States has no other solution but to recognize   in deeds, and not in words   the inalienable right of the peoples of VietNam, Laos and Cambodia to be masters in their own house and to decide the future of their countries for themselves.
161.	The recent peace initiative taken at the Paris conference by the delegation of the Republic of South VietNam opens up new possibilities for a just settlement of the VietNam problem.
162.	The situation in Korea also continues to be a source of international tension. United States forces are still occupying South Korea, and more and more United States weapons are being sent there. The delegations of a number of countries, including the delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, again proposed for inclusion in the agenda for this session an item on the withdrawal of United States and all other foreign forces occupying South Korea under the flag of the United Nations [A18044 and Add. 131 and an item on the dissolution of the so-called United
Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea [A18045 and Add. 13].
163.	We are still convinced that the adoption of these proposals will contribute to the peaceful reunification of the country in accordance with the aspirations of the Korean people.
164.	At this session, we shall again have to deal comprehensively with the problem of disarmament. General and complete disarmament, as a means and reliable guarantee of achieving lasting peace and security, is the most important problem facing the world today. As we all know, this was stressed as long ago as the fourteenth session of the General Assembly in resolution 1378 (XIV). The urgent need for agreement on general and complete disarmament is dictated by the entire course of developments in the present-day international situation, especially by the ever increasing rate of the arms race.
165.	Here are just two figures which have a truly dreadful significance: in 1962 total world military expenditure amounted to $120,000 million, but now it already exceeds $200,000 million. It does not need any particular feat of imagination to foresee the future course of events if we do not unite and use our utmost energy to stop the advance of this ever-growing avalanche. The danger which threatens mankind is so formidable and all-encompassing that any effective efforts that can move us forward towards a solution of the disarmament problem should be supported with the full authority of the United Nations. We must be guided by the consideration that the halting of the arms race and the attainment of general and complete disarmament would establish a solid foundation for world peace, and would make it possible to divert immense resources to constructive uses and ensure the genuine progress of mankind.
166.	The very core and the basis of general and complete disarmament is, of course, nuclear disarmament.
167.	Our country has declared more than once that it is strongly and consistently in favor of banning atomic weapons, excluding them from the arsenals of States and then destroying existing stockpiles.
168.	The obstacles to a solution of this problem are considerable, but we should be inspired by the successes which we have already achieved in disarmament. These include the Treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water , the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies [resolution 2222 (XXI)], and the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)].
169.	The time has come to take the next step in this field and to prohibit the emplacement of devices with nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction
5 Signed in Moscow on 5 August 1963.
on the seabed and the ocean floor, and in the subsoil thereof.
170.	The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which has a long coastline, attaches great importance to the exclusion of the seabed and the ocean floor from the arms race. It is essential to ensure that the seabed and the ocean floor are exploited and utilized exclusively for peaceful and constructive purposes. The Ukrainian delegation considers that the draft treaty on the prohibition of the emplacement of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and the ocean floor and in the subsoil there of , which the Committee on Disarmament has submitted for consideration by the General Assembly, should be adopted by the Assembly and opened for signature.
171.	The negotiations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the question of strategic arms limitation   the second stage of which has recently been concluded in Vienna   also have an exceptional significance which is obvious to every one of us.
172.	Our delegation expresses its satisfaction at the useful exchange of views that has taken place in Vienna. We are sure that the United Nations ardently hopes for a positive development of these negotiations, which are of primary importance for limiting and halting the nuclear weapons race.
173.	Another immediate and pressing task is the adoption of urgent measures to ban chemical and bacteriological (biological) weapons. The Ukrainian delegation, which together with other socialist countries is sponsoring a draft convention on chemical and bacteriological weapons , proceeded from the premise that the adoption of a general document covering both types of weapons would be a logical extension of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 which, as we know, is based precisely on the concept of a single approach to the prohibition of such weapons. We note with satisfaction that this approach has found support both in the Committee on Disarmament and here, in the Assembly.
174.	The purpose of the draft convention proposed by the socialist countries is to protect mankind from the danger of a chemical and bacteriological war and to eliminate completely these weapons of mass destruction.
175.	Many of the delegations which have already spoken from this rostrum have referred again and again to the immense significance of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The Declaration, which was adopted ten years ago on the initiative of the Soviet Union and was drafted in close cooperation with representatives of the young independent countries, was indeed a historic landmark in the work of our Organization.
176.	By outlawing colonialism, this document has not only inspired oppressed peoples to struggle for their independence, but has also contributed to the recognition of the legitimacy and justice of this struggle in international law.
177.	As a result of the blows struck by anti-imperialist and national liberation revolutions, dozens of independent States have emerged in the place of the old colonial world.
178.	While we sincerely rejoice at this revolutionary process of liberation, we cannot forget for a moment that approximately 30 million people are still suffering under the yoke of colonial slavery. The main obstacle to the final elimination of colonialism is constituted by the forces of imperialism. It is they that are trying by all available means to suppress the national liberation struggle of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe and of the Portuguese colonies of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). It is with this aim in view that the imperialist Powers and international monopolies are strengthening their economic, political and military ties with the Republic of South Africa, with the Smith regime in Rhodesia and with Portugal.
179.	We associate ourselves with the position of the nonaligned countries, which at their recent conference at Lusaka expressed their profound indignation at the violation by the Governments of a number of Western countries of the embargo on the supply of arms to the South African racists. The peoples understand perfectly well that the Republic of South Africa is using these weapons to expand its punitive operations within its own frontiers, to support the Portuguese colonialists and Rhodesian racists and to commit aggressive acts against the independence of African countries.
180.	The United Nations, having adopted the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, cannot allow the last strongholds of racism, apartheid and colonial oppression in.southern Africa to be strengthened.
181.	The interests of peace, justice and freedom insistently demand that we should have done with colonialism once and for all and should purge our planet of the evils of racism and apartheid.
182.	This session of the Organization coincides with the end of the First United Nations Development Decade. We have to admit with regret that its practical results have been insignificant. Indeed, what real success in this regard can be claimed if, in the 1960s, certain developing countries have become the victims of direct imperialist aggression which has brought them ruin rather than development, while many others have been deliberately deprived of the opportunity to participate on a basis of equality in a just system for the international division of labor? It is essential to bear in mind that the programs of the First Development Decade were implemented in conditions in which the exploitation of the developing countries by the developed capitalist States not only failed to cease but was, on the contrary, intensified; in which the gap between the levels of economic development in these two groups of countries widened; in which the arms race continued, and thousands of millions were consequently diverted for military purposes.
183.	The joint statement by eight socialist countries on the second decade of development and social progress [A 18074] expresses support for the idea and objectives of this decade and declares that it 'can become an important factor in the improvement of international economic relations'. But for this it is essential that its programs should be based on principles which will ensure a genuine acceleration of social and economic development.
184.	The socialist countries are convinced that it is essential to bear in mind above all the paramount significance of measures for the general improvement of the international situation and measures for disarmament, which would make it possible to release enormous resources for solving serious economic and social problems and raising the standard of living of millions of people.
185.	It is also perfectly obvious that the effective development of any country must be based on national planning and on the rational utilization of domestic material, financial and human resources. The experience of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the other socialist countries has confirmed the productiveness of precisely this course of development.
186.	It therefore follows that in the national plans of the developing States provision should be made first for measures to ensure the maximum mobilization and rational use of domestic resources. This in turn calls for improvements in budgetary and tax legislation, and for measures to restrict the activities of foreign capital and to establish and consolidate the State and cooperative sectors in important branches of the national economy. To achieve success, it is also essential to train skilled national personnel.
187.	It is perfectly obvious that real progress in social and economic development during the Second Decade will be possible only by observing the sovereign right of the developing countries to make full and comprehensive use of their natural and human resources.
188.	An analysis of modern economic relations shows that many developing countries resort to external sources of financing to clear off their indebtedness on earlier loans and to make current payment of returns, interest and dividends on private foreign investment. At the present time, their national debt payments exceed $5,000 million a year, and the total indebtedness of the developing countries amounts to $50,000 million.
189.	The situation will become even more difficult in the future. According to calculations by experts, the total indebtedness of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America will reach $90,000  $100,000 million by 1980, and payments on these debts will exceed total annual receipts from external sources.
190.	Our delegation fully shares the view that the developing countries have an incontestable right to receive compensation from the colonialists and neo-colonialists for the material damage caused to them by these countries.
191.	It is clear that the socialist countries cannot assume the burden of responsibility for the plunder which the liberated peoples suffered at the hands of the colonial Powers.
192.	The obligation to make an annual contribution of 1 per cent of the gross national product of the economically developed countries to assist developing countries cannot, of course, apply to the socialist countries.
193.	At the same time, I should like to stress that the socialist countries, conscious of their international duty, will continue their policy of providing assistance in every possible way to the young independent States in establishing and strengthening their independent national economies.
194.	In evaluating the work of the United Nations over a quarter of a century at this anniversary session, we consider it important to stress the following: the Organization's successes are linked with consistent and strict observance of the Charter. As for its failures, they have as a rule been the result of violations of the fundamental principles of the United Nations as they are laid down in the Charter.
195.	During the years of the existence of the United Nations, great changes have taken place in the world. As the result of the strengthening of the world system of socialism, the collapse of colonialism and the formation of independent States which have joined the ranks of the United Nations, the positions of the peace-loving forces in the Organization have become stronger. But the changes that have taken place do not in any way call for a review either of the basic provisions of the Charter or of the structure of the United Nations and the principles governing its activities.
196.	In this connexion, I should like to refer to the words of Mr. Almadou Ahidjo, President of the Federal Republic of Cameroon, who stressed in his statement on 22 September that:
'...it would be wrong to seek the cause of the weaknesses of the United Nations in the uselessness or obsolescence of the principles of the Charter which we feel still to be fully valid today...' [1845th meeting, para. 27].
197.	The way to improve still further the effectiveness of the United Nations is not to disrupt the Charter but, on the contrary, to observe its spirit and letter and a'! of its provisions strictly and absolutely and to make full use of the opportunities it offers for the adoption of measures for the maintenance of peace and the development of international cooperation.
198.	Even now, a quarter of a century after the establishment of the United Nations, we can still see in the Charter of the Organization unused political resources which must be brought into action. One example which is certainly significant in this connexion is the recent decision of the Security Council [1544th meeting] to hold special periodic meetings in accordance with Article 28 of the Charter.
199.	Our delegation considers that the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations should be marked by the mobilization of the efforts of all Member States to achieve the full and effective implementation of the purposes and principles of the Organization's Charter. We think it would be useful for the United Nations in its twenty-fifth anniversary year to reaffirm in an appropriate document their full relevance and urgency in present-day circumstances.
200.	The United Nations bears a heavy responsibility for the cause of peace. This calls for the solidarity and unity of all progressive forces. The socialist countries are in favor of increasing the effectiveness of the United Nations and are demonstrating this by their positive action.
201.	This anniversary of the United Nations should be famed in history not for expansive statements, but for important, far-reaching and constructive solutions of international problems and, above all, for the strengthening of international peace and security.
202.	Our common task is to strengthen the United Nations in every possible way and to work unremittingly to make it a genuinely universal organization and an authoritative and active center of collective action in the cause of genuine peace and the security and progress of all peoples.
"
25,1970,SYR,"1.	 Mr. President, it is a particular pleasure for me to convey to you on this solemn occasion my most sincere congratulations upon your election to this high post. Your great personal, human and intellectual qualities have earned you the confidence, esteem and respect of all the Members of this Organization. We would like to express our esteem for you as one of the founders of this Organization and one of the promoters of its noble principles. We express the hope that
under your leadership during this twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly we shall find the success and progress for which we all hope.
2.	When this Organization was born 25 years ago, my country, which took a very active part in the preparation of its Charter, was proud to range itself alongside those who placed their signature on the final document. Like them, my country hoped that an end had been finally put to war, that the reign of the Nazi and Facist crimes had disappeared for ever and that man could finally live free, in a free society, and freely determine his own fate. There was much hope that the exploitation of small nations by big nations would finally disappear, that colonialism and imperialism belonged to the hideous past and that future society would be fashioned on the model of ideas which formed the basis of the Charter. The Charter promised happiness, peace and security to a world which had been torn for more than five years by a savage and devastating war.
3.	On this great and memorable occasion when several Heads of State and statesmen will be meeting here to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization, it is entirely natural to examine the successes and failures of the last quarter of a century.
4.	I do not want to be pessimistic and to begin with failures. On the contrary I shall begin with successes
and shall try to be as optimistic as possible, for my country, in spite of everything, is still attached to the noble purposes of our Organization.
5.	I shall try to be optimistic in spite of the tremendous misfortune that has just plunged the Arab world into mourning and consternation through the loss of its greatest leader and chief, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Everyone is aware of the place which President Abdel Nasser occupied in Syrian hearts, before the unity with Egypt, during that unity and after it. The United Arab Republic owes its name and colors to that unity. Syrians for their part know that Syria always occupied in the heart of President Abdel Nasser a privileged place. President Abdel Nasser could have, if he had wanted to, maintained that unity by force. But he said that unity which was based on the love and fraternity of two peoples should not be maintained by force of arms. President Nasser gained a great deal more than he lost by this magnanimous, noble and far-sighted attitude. Unity between the two regions, in spite of their official separation, was maintained by sentiment, by total understanding and co-operation, by the same struggle against imperialism and Zionism and, finally, by the love and veneration which the two peoples, Egyptian and Syrian, always had and will always have for President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
6.	I should like to take this opportunity to recall a sentence uttered by the caliph Abou-Bakr after the death of the prophet Mohammed. Addressing the Moslems who were mourning the prophet, he said: 'If you worship Mohammed, Mohammed is dead, but if you worship God, God exists. He is powerful and eternal.'
7.	The principles to which Abdel Nasser dedicated his whole life will remain and grow in our hearts. The great victories of Islam were accomplished after the death of the prophet, by his disciples and brothers. But, although President Nasser is dead, the Arab nation lives. That nation which produced Omar ibn el Khattab, Khaled ibn el-Walid, Moussa ibn Nousseir, Saladin and other leaders will produce other Abdel Nassers. Therefore, in spite of our mourning I shall try to be optimistic.
A/PV.1856
8.	More than anyone else, the Secretary-General can enumerate in his annual report [A 18001 and Corr.l], with clear and precise examples, the successes of our Organization. To repeat that would be futile. To challenge it would be to fail in courtesy towards him. I admit, however, that the greatest success of our Organization lies in its survival. For it to continue to survive in spite of the many difficulties which have 
confronted it and the disdain in which certain great Powers hold it is in itself an enormous success. However, we should admit that this Organization owes its survival to its Secretary-General, who, by his rare and exceptional qualities, his indefatigable work, his wisdom and faith, has managed to maintain the Organization's prestige, value and dignity. I hasten on this occasion to congratulate the Secretary-General for his efforts to facilitate the forthcoming admission of Bahrein to our Organization and Fiji's accession to independence. I would add that, by his assiduous efforts, this Organization has helped a great number of peoples to free themselves from the yoke of colonialism, to acquire independence and to become, by that very fact, Members of our Organization, thus effectively contributing to our work and bringing to our Organization their scientific, cultural and moral support.
9.	We should note, however, that the most striking successes have been achieved by the specialized agencies in economic, social and cultural spheres. I should like to mention particularly UNESCO, which has done a great deal to assist the propagation of science and culture. I would, however, welcome the opportunity of hearing, here as in UNESCO, the ILO and FAO, that the Arab language has become an official language because it is a language already spoken in 14 countries and more than 100 million people understand and listen to it.
10.	I should like also to pay a tribute to and express my appreciation of the juridical and humane work done by the International Law Commission, which has codified a series of laws and treaties constituting a vital and lasting contribution to the treasury of international law.
11.	We hope that our Assembly will at its present session adopt the draft declaration on principles of international law concerning friendly relations and co-operation among States, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [A/8082, para. 8], a declaration that will lay the basis for a solid and durable peace.
12.	I am very much afraid that the list of failures which I am about to enumerate and upon which the Secretary-General dwelt at some length in his annual report may be rather longer and more extensive than the list of successes. It is clear that some of these failures can still be retrieved. By this I mean the admission to membership of the United Nations of States which hitherto have been kept outside of our Organization. That is the case with the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the German Democratic Republic.
13.	My delegation expresses the hope most sincerely that the United Nations will admit to membership immediately these States which, through their age-old civilizations and their human, scientific and cultural potential, could make a very valuable, very rich and very beneficial contribution to our Organization,
14.	It is a challenge to civilized society and a 'continuing affront to human dignity' to use the terms employed by the Secretary-General when he spoke of apartheid and of seeing racist, Zionist and colonialist States freely occupying seats in this Assembly, at the very time when the free States of which I have spoken remain outside the Organization. These racist States, against which several resolutions have been adopted could not have defied the United Nations if they had not previously been assured of the support of the Anglo-Saxon imperialists. The British Parliament not too long ago adopted a decision to supply arms to South Africa. A similar decision was taken two weeks ago by President Nixon who decided to provide arms to Israel in the amount of $450 million. South Africa will use these weapons against the African people and Israel will use them against the Arabs.
15.	Just a few days ago a most honorable and distinguished Foreign Minister of a great country spoke from this very rostrum of a return to the law of the jungle. I wonder how one could describe the sale of destructive weapons to South Africa. It seems to me that this distinguished Minister forgot that the law of the jungle was established by one of his illustrious predecessors more than 50 years ago when he promised a land which he did not own to a people which did not exist. He should have promised it a part of his own kingdom. That would have been much simpler and more logical and the world would not have suffered for more than half a century the troubles which have kept the constant threat of another world war hovering over our heads. For more than 30 years this law of the jungle was established and carried out by successive British Governments in Palestine. It continues now in the hands of the Zionists and racists by what they so insolently call collective punishment. These acts of pure barbarism were condemned by our General Assembly last year in resolution 2535 B (XXIV) which speaks of 'collective punishment, arbitrary detention, curfews, destruction of homes and property, deportation and other repressive acts against the refugees and other inhabitants of the occupied territories'. This is the law of the jungle which Great Britain established in Palestine and which the United States is protecting, encouraging and supporting today by every possible means.
16.	If apartheid in South Africa is an affront to human dignity, discrimination in Israel is an abominable crime because it aims at the total annihilation of the Palestinian people by the Zionists, colonialists, imperialists and their agents.
17.	These Palestinian peoples whom they want to liquidate by all possible means have been living for some 20 years in tents, in an inhuman atmosphere, in cruel and inhuman physical and social conditions. The only harvest has been death, privation and poverty, poverty which engenders hate, indignation and revolt against all institutions and in particular against our Organization because it was this Organization which was the source of these evils and the basis of the misfortunes of these people.
18.	Twenty-two years ago the United Nations made its greatest mistake, and by this very fact it committed the greatest injustice in the history of mankind. After 22 years now the whole world has been reaping the bitter harvest of this injustice and is becoming more and more aware of the serious consequences of this mistake.
19.	If during the course of history certain examples of fait accompli have been accepted, the artificial creation of Israel in Palestine will never be agreed to. It is a grafting operation which will have no success. Rejection is stronger and the patient who has been the subject of such grafting will die sooner or later.
20.	The Palestinian people is aware today of its personality. As a nation it has become entirely fedayeen. Its struggle for the recovery of its usurped motherland is most just and noble. It is not alone in its struggle, it has the whole Arab people behind it. All the forces of freedom in the whole world are behind it. Even in the most reactionary and most capitalistic of countries the free masses are supporting the struggle of the Palestinians. It is no longer a refugee people who are living on the alms doled out by UNRWA. It is a people conscious of its rights and its future. It has been waiting in vain for 23 years to see the awakening of the human conscience of the world and the principles and the resolutions put into effect and the people responsible for the crime punished. But the days go by, misfortunes accumulate and the resolutions pile up. These resolutions recognize their inalienable rights but remain dead letters because that is the wish of the imperialists and the Zionists. Not having succeeded in recovering their legitimate rights from the United Nations, the Palestinian people will resort to all possible means to liberate their homeland.
21.	I should like to take this opportunity to say how great, sublime, brave and magnanimous is the attitude of Mrs. Bandaranaike, a lady full of courage and dignity, or wisdom and humanity, when she so bravely corrected the mistake committed by the previous Government of Ceylon and withdrew recognition from the State of Israel.
22.	How great and praiseworthy is the attitude of the countries which have refused to recognize this artificial creation and which have so bravely resisted all imperialist pressure to recognize Israel.
23.	How great, estimable and praiseworthy is the attitude of the Soviet Union and the socialist countries which, after the Zionist act of aggression of 1967 against Arab countries, broke off diplomatic relations with Israel and are giving us all possible support and are at our side in condemning the acquisition by force of Arab territories, and which are demanding the total withdrawal of the forces of aggression from all occupied territories.
24.	How great and praiseworthy is the attitude of the non-aligned countries which, in the Dar-es-Salaam Preparatory Conference and in the Summit Conference in Lusaka, recognized in unambiguous terms the inalienable right of the Palestinian people and called for their resettlement in their usurped motherland, and supported their national liberation struggle against colonialism and racism. The Lusaka Conference condemns in clear terms the flagrant policy of the continuous use of force as a means of exercising pressure and considers that it is inadmissible for Israe! to continue to occupy the territories of three, sovereign non- aligned States.
25.	I should not forget, either, the numerous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, all of which recognize the rights of the Palestinian people and condemn most severely the Israeli refusal to apply the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in time of War.
26.	I should not like to dwell further on the Palestine question because, however important and delicate a question it may be, it should not cause us to forget the other problems of the world for which the United Nations should find a solution.
27.	The position of the Syrian Government with regard to those problems has been stated clearly at the Summit Conference of the non-aligned countries, and I would venture to state that position briefly here.
28.	On the subject of Africa, the Syrian Government condemns racism and apartheid and demands that the South African Government cease its policy of separate development.
29.	We also condemn the racist Government of that country for having imposed its colonial domination on the people of Namibia and call upon the United Nations to use all possible means available to it to give the people of Namibia their right to self-determination. It condemns the sale of arms to South Africa from whatever source.
30.	The Syrian Government also condemns the racist minority of Southern Rhodesia and demands the use of force to oblige it to grant to the people of Zimbabwe the right of self-determination.
31.	It condemns Portuguese colonization in South Africa and supports the liberation movements in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).
32.	In regard to Asia, the Syrian Government condemns the American war of aggression in Indo-China and demands the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all American imperialist forces and their allies from South Viet-Nam and the recognition of the Provisional Revolutionary Government as the only representative of the people of South Viet-Nam.
33.	It condemns American intervention in Laos and Cambodia and demands that the legal Government of President Norodom Sihanouk resume its seat in this Assembly.
1 Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries held at Lusaka. Zambia, from 8 to 10 September 1970.
34.	The Syrian Government demands the withdrawal of the United States troops and troops of all other foreign countries occupying South Korea under the flag of the United Nations, the dissolution of the United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea, and the unification of North and South Korea on the basis of free general elections.
35.	In the Middle East, the Syrian Government condemns Zionist racist aggression and imperialist aggression against Arab countries. It demands the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Zionist occupation forces from all territories and all positions acquired after 5 June 1967, in order to prevent the aggressor from enjoying the fruits of his aggression. The question is not one of evacuating certain territories in order to maintain secure frontiers, because even the Atlantic Ocean in our day does not constitute a secure frontier.
36.	The Syrian Government fully recognizes the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and sup-ports it in its legitimate struggle to liberate its land from the neo-Nazi colonialist occupiers.
37.	The will for peace mentioned by the Secretary- General in the introduction to his annual report [A 180011Add. 1 and Con. 1] is and remains the most ardent desire of my country and this has always been the case. Its attachment to peace, together with the generosity and hospitality which are very well known features of the Arabs, has earned us for many centuries the reward of foreign domination. There is a peace imposed by force and based upon the denial of rights, and this a fragile peace doomed to failure. The period between the two world wars was sufficient demonstration of this. There is also a peace based upon right and justice, and this is the peace which lasts. Yesterday, from this very rostrum [1854th meeting], the representative of the United States, speaking of peace in the Middle East, said that his Government is ready to renew its efforts for peace in this region.
38.	With your permission, I shall explain to you how the American Congress understands those efforts and carries them out. Two days ago, 29 September 1970, there was an article in The New York Times from which I shall read certain extracts: it is entitled 'Israelis get assurances from Congress that they can buy missiles and tanks as well as planes'. The article reads:
'Israel received explicit assurances from Congress today that the arms she might buy on favorable credit terms in the United States would include missiles and tanks as well as aircraft.
'This clarification was contained in a House- Senate conference Committee's version of the $19.9 billion military procurement bill, which was sent to the two chambers and is expected to win final approval later this week.'
The article continues:
'With the bill imposing no cost or quantitative limits on Israeli credit purchases, the Administration had the specific authority to grant Israel probably the most open-ended arms buying program in the world.
'Because of Israel's shortage of foreign exhange, she has been permitted under the bill to obtain military equipment here on credit terms not less favorable than those offered other countries.
'In the past, Israel paid in cash for most of her purchases. For the 50 Phantoms authorized in 1968, she paid two-thirds in cash, with one-third covered in short-term credit. In addition to the new credit arrangement, the Administration is preparing to refinance earlier Israeli defense purchase debts.
'Today's action in Congress served to reassure the Israelis of easy access to American equipment as the Middle Eastern crisis deepened.' 
39. The United States, then has offered Israel limitless funds and enormous facilities to acquire tremendous quantities of aggressive arms to be used against the Arabs. That is the American interpretation of the will to peace. Happily, in the free world peace is not viewed in the same way, and with your permission I shall also read an excerpt from an article by Mr. George Montaron published on 13 August 1970 in Christian Witness:
' 'Peace? But what peace? In 1947 a grave injustice was committed against the Palestinians. They were driven out of the towns and countryside where they had been born. They have to live in exile. This injustice must be redressed. These men and women have the right to live in their own homes if they so wish.
'Since 1947 hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been living as second-class citizens because they are Arabs, Moslems or Christians because they are not Jews. This situation cannot continue. A growing number of Israelis are beginning to resent this fact, and their action should be supported.
'Since 1967 Arab people have been living under an occupation regime. They have been awaiting liberation, a legitimate demand because there can no longer be and I quote Pope John XXIII 'people who dominate and people who are dominated'.
'It is these truths of which the Palestinian organizations ceaselessly remind us, and do so vigorously, even if it is a little annoying. How can they possibly be reproached for that? The super-Powers are ignoring the Palestinians, as they did in 1947 when they gave the Jews the land of Palestine as though it were uninhabited. Many Governments fear them because they are poor and free of any connexion with imperialists and because they have the revolutionary ideal that is a cause for anxiety for feudal systems. As to world public opinion, it is not too familiar with them because they have hardly presented themselves to the world yet.
'But they are the very root of the question in the Middle East.
'It is said that armed struggle is not the only way for them to make themselves heard and to recover their dignity. That may be true, but so far they have had no alternative. Do present political trends in the Middle East allow them to fight on the diplomatic and political plane? That is not certain. However, the Palestinian leaders have the duty to leave no stone unturned in seeking the best means of attaining their objective in the best possible conditions. Let them not forget that sometimes war is, despite appearances and the suffering of those who fall in battle, an easy way for leaders who lack imagination. Let them remember that in recent history peoples have struggled for their liberation and that they were able to use many different means. Revolutions are not to be copied. Freedom struggles are not always the same. It is for each to find its own way, and in this we can trust the Palestinian leaders because they are very closely connected with their own peoples.'
40.	What, then, is the peace professed here by the Israeli Foreign Minister? Peace dictated by aggression? Peace based on annexation? The peace refused by Dayan, Begin and their colleagues? The peace of Deir Yassin and the other monstrous massacres? Peace based on the complete denial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people? What peace? And what confidence can we have in the words of the Foreign Minister of Israel, which have been refuted by the threatening statements of his militarist colleagues?
41.	If Israel really wants peace, let it negotiate with the Palestinian leaders. They are the ones most closely concerned in the matter. Let them begin by carrying out the innumerable resolutions of this Assembly that have remained dead letters in the archives. Actions and sincerity make us believe people, not fine words, rhetoric or dialectics.
42.	The same Foreign Minister spoke of 'the invasion of Jordan by regular armored units of the Syrian army' [1851st meeting, para. 122], I say this parenthetically, because he mentioned it; I shall not reply to his false allegations, but I would refer you to the report of a Reuters correspondent who is neither Syrian nor Palestinian; everyone knows that Reuters is a British agency. He was on the spot when the fighting was going on, and he categorically denied the participation of Syrian forces in the fighting.
43.	When coming to this twenty-fifth anniversary session, we representatives asked ourselves whether this session was going to be as ineffective as previous ones or whether something more constructive was going to happen here.
44.	I have no doubt that all representatives and delegates, like myself, have the desire to see this Organization become an effective instrument of peace and progress in the world, and to see its resolutions and decisions carried out and its prestige confirmed and enhanced.
45.	To that end, it is necessary for the United States, which has welcomed the Organization on its territory, to cease looking upon the United Nations as an instrument for the pursuit of its imperialist policy. This Organization must serve noble principles and ideals, not the interests of any given party. It should pursue the purposes laid down at its creation. Otherwise, it will share the fate of the League of Nations.
46.	When heads of State and statesmen met more than. 25 years ago at Dumbarton Oaks and San Francisco to draw up the Charter of this Organization they had a shining image of a free Lnd democratic America, the America of Lincoln, Jefferson and Roosevelt  America the liberator. They chose New York as the seat of this Organization in the hope that they would find here peace, security and freedom freedom of expression, at least because the Statue of Liberty which adorns New York harbor is bigger than the statue of Lincoln. Unfortunately, she has turned her back on the United States. And that is very significant, because after the 1939-1945 war the United. States inherited European imperialism and colonialism. Of the glorious history of the United States there remains only the image of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the atrocious war of extermination in Viet-Nam, the military intervention in Laos and Cambodia, and massive arms assistance and unconditional support for Israel in its aggression against the Arab countries.
47.	Freedom of expression is no longer guaranteed even within this sacred precinct of the United Nations, because at the very time one of our Arab colleagues was making a speech, just a few days ago, his mission was bombed. No one knows what may happen to any of us if his speech does not suit his American hosts. Our mission has often been sacked and occupied by reckless and irresponsible elements, and officials have been manhandled. Is that the freedom of thought representatives of States Members of this Organization should enjoy?
48.	I leave it to you to answer that question.




"
25,1970,MAR,"81.	  Mr. President, on the threshold of this twenty- fifth session of the General Assembly, which we hope will be not just a commemorative anniversary, but a pause for deep and fruitful reflection in order better to assure and adapt the progress of the international community towards peace, justice and progress, my delegation is glad to welcome warmly the unanimous choice which has brought you to the Presidency of the Assembly at this historic session.
82.	This choice is undoubtedly an indication of the will to seriousness and the intention to succeed. Your thorough skill in international law, your long experience of this Organization, and the fact that you belong to a family and a country which have given distinguished statesmen to service in the League of Nations and the United Nations should assure us, that we have indeed chosen, for exceptional circumstances, a man who will raise our debates to the level of the hopes that the international community justifiably places in this twenty-fifth session of our General Assembly.
83.	May I, Mr. President, add my personal satisfaction in addressing these words to the representative of a country whose relations of friendship and cooperation with Morocco are marked with an exemplary spirit in international cooperation, in esteem and in mutual respect.
84.	Our Organization is completing its first quarter century of existence and embarking on the last decades of a century during which mankind has lived through what are perhaps the most decisive events of its destiny. The international community must courageously take stock of this Organization's years of existence, not to lament what it has not done or what it should have done, but above all to seek ways and means of ensuring effectively the realization of the hopes to which it gave expression 25 years ago, some of the most legitimate of which are far from having been brought to fruition.
85.	Our Organization has undoubtedly been an adequate instrument for preventing or stopping grave crises in the postwar years. It is also true that the Organization has gone far toward eliminating the concept of the supremacy of force, of the hegemony of power, and toward introducing into international relations certain concepts that were unknown or that were deliberately ignored before its creation.
86.	During the many international crises of the past 25 years, the United Nations has provided a meeting place, direct or indirect, for antagonistic forces whenever confrontation interrupted dialog and led the parties to the edge of the abyss. It has, above all, been platform and tribunal, a hearing place and also a factor of encouragement in the face of persistent colonialism, whose conscience it has stirred and whose grip it has weakened in the greater part of the world where it held sway. It has attempted to be a court of appeal, a guide and a helping hand to States whose first steps in the international community have been difficult. It tries, as part of the restoration of national sovereignty and the equality of States, to reduce persistent injustices and to close the real gap that still exists between the privileged part of mankind and the rest, whose poverty and ignorance still remain, and will remain into the indefinite future, the lot that the selfishness of the great Powers continues to inflict on them.
87.	One of the paramount future tasks of the Organization must be a continuing concern to ensure the ever increasing primacy of law and international morality, to ensure all States the means to secure respect for the prerogatives of their sovereignty in international equality, and to ensure all citizens of the world peace, freedom, prosperity and justice.
88.	What our Organization has already accomplished is undoubtedly immense when one considers the anarchy that international relations might have been if power and violence had been the only law. But if we consider the present state of international affairs and what the situation is likely to become, we realize with anguish what the fate of mankind would be if the Organization should fail to awaken to the imperative need to be more dynamic, more firm and more scrupulous as to the validity of its principles.
89.	Most of the international crises now confronting the Organization are chronic crises that began years ago. Solutions to these crises, found for better or worse at the time they arose have remained a dead letter   a fact that, with the passing years has increased their gravity and correspondingly weakened the authority of our Organization.
90.	Three years have passed since the Israeli aggression of June 1967 and it is an illusion to suppose that the war in the Middle East lasted only six days. In actual fact it has scarcely ever ceased. Indeed, Israel has almost constantly intensified military operations inside the occupied territories, against Jordanian territory, has carried the war across the frontiers and into the villages of Lebanon, and has undertaken a series of aerial bombardments against the towns and industrial installations of the United Arab Republic. The war has continued without surcease on both sides of the Suez Canal and the opposing artillery batteries in that zone have caused more damage than on certain fronts in the Second World War.
91 Yet in the United Nations and in several capitals many efforts have been made to ensure respect for the ceasefire and to start things moving towards the quest for a solution.
92.	The Tel Aviv Government and its military chief of staff have continuously opposed all these initiatives and have often created political and military situations which made the quest for peace even more difficult and more remote.
93.	The Security Council resolution of 22 November 19671242 (1967)] nevertheless defined the framework within which this quest for peace might be successfully pursued. But through its rhetoric the Israeli Government, which has chosen to give that resolution as many interpretations as it has members, has blocked the numerous efforts that the international community optimistically attempted to maintain.
94.	During these three years of continuous warfare and tireless efforts, the Israeli Government's policy has revealed at least one constant: rejection of peace and determination to consolidate its present conquests as one stage in an expansion that some of its members unabashedly proclaim from time to time.
95.	Early in August this year the international community welcomed with hope the latest initiative the result of great and concerted efforts. It may be said today, with deep conviction and in the light of the latest events, that the dilatory maneuvers of Tel Aviv are the source of the deteriorating situation in the region. Since the acceptance of the Security Council resolution by the Arab States concerned, nothing has been forthcoming from the Israelis to encourage them in their will to peace. Indeed, the intensification of military operations on the one hand, and diplomatic intransigence on the other, have justified the Arab world in its substitution of despair for hope.
96.	The new situation created by the tragic death of President Nasser at a time when he was courageously doing everything possible to bring peace closer renders still greater the responsibility of the Tel Aviv Government, which has done everything   and in the most irresponsible fashion   to delay any move towards a political solution. In paying tribute to the statesmanship of President Nasser the whole world has unanimously recalled his desire to restore peace in the region and his courage in having tried to do so. The Egyptian leader's death is not only a profound sorrow for the Egyptian people; in him, the Arab world has lost one of the most outstanding figures of its recent history; the international community, too, has lost one of the most dedicated architects of the policy of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation.
97.	The trial period of the ceasefire is now drawing to a close. Must we again let it pass, to the satisfaction of Israel? If so, what future might be expected after 7 November? Must the international community be a helpless witness first to aggression, then to provocations compromising all peace efforts, and tomorrow, perhaps, to the resumption of a war that could only be more violent still? But we must however repeat here what we for our part have constantly emphasized at all times and what His Majesty the King has also repeatedly reaffirmed, namely, that the quest for a just and lasting solution in the region must necessarily be built on respect for the rights of the Palestinian people as such.
98.	The principles set forth in the Security Council resolution and in the latest peace initiative should indeed make it possible to eliminate the consequences of the aggression and to secure respect for the principles of the Charter. But any peace effort, no matter how praiseworthy, would remain inadequate if it ignored one of the most pertinent realities of the Middle East situation, namely, the existence of the Palestinian people and their legitimate determination to shoulder their own destiny.
99.	It is because the peacemakers persist in regarding the Palestinian factor as a mere refugee problem, to which a so-called humanitarian solution could be found by assembling them in camps and assuring them, for better or worse, of a marginal existence, that they were more or less taken by surprise by the tragic events that lately rent Jordan. It would be criminal, above all after that tragedy, to fail to recognize that the refugees have become combatants and that those combatants are a people who wish to recover their native land.
100.	Resolutions that approach this problem with euphemisms and peace plans that try to ignore it will remain futile endeavors. If it is really desired to bring back peace in the Middle East, the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people must necessarily be envisaged.
101.	The rapid and dangerous development of the situation in the Middle East requires lucid and energetic decisions in the days ahead. Our Organization has a legal and political framework within which to seek a solution; the SecretaryGeneral has a personal representative whose qualities have been acclaimed throughout the world; the great Powers are aware of what is at stake in this development; must Tel Aviv alone insist on perpetuating a territorial occupation which is incompatible with the restoration of peace, and must the international conscience continue to disregard the rights of the Palestinian people whose tragic fate no longer allows their existence to be ignored?
102.	As crucial as the crisis in the Middle East is the situation prevailing in Africa, where thousands of Africans are still undergoing the most backward and degrading forms of colonialism and of racial discrimination entered into a system of state.
103.	In the years immediately following the Second World War the United Nations played a remarkable role in accelerating the process of decolonization and the accession of many countries to independence and sovereignty. But progress in this field has been halted by the systematically negative attitude adopted towards the United Nations by those who practise colonialism and apartheid, particularly South Africa and Portugal.
104.	Despite the universal condemnation of apartheid by the United Nations as a crime against humanity, despite resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960 on the granting of independence to countries still under colonial domination and resolution 2145 (XXI) terminating the South African Mandate over Namibia, despite the economic sanctions ordered against Rhodesia, South Africa and Portugal, these countries continue with impunity their work of exploitation and oppression in South Africa, Namibia, Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).
105.	The most alarming factor in this situation is the economic and military assistance that certain States Members of the United Nations continue to extend to South Africa and Portugal. This economic and military assistance, and more particularly the increase in foreign investments in the territories under colonial domination in southern Africa, are helping politically to strengthen the colonialist regimes and constitute a more and more specific threat to the independent African countries and Africa generally.
106.	The alliance between Portugal, South Africa and the Salisbury regime confirms that the colonial regimes in power in southern Africa are attempting to encircle independent Africa.
107.	Two years ago our SecretaryGeneral called attention to the gravity of the situation and addressed the following remarks to the African Heads of State:
' I must recognize that the destiny of the world will be influenced greatly if not decisively by the future development of events in Africa. Peace and progress throughout the world depend on peace and progress in developing Africa.'
11
108.	It is a fact that the force and authority of the principles of the Charter   which brought about the decisive event of this century, namely the emancipation of many peoples of the earth   have lost some of their hold on much of world opinion. Whether in South Africa or other parts of Africa still under colonial rule, the tide of colonialism in that part of the world, so far from ebbing, is clearly gaining strength.
109.	On the occasion of its twenty-fifth anniversary, our Organization should reaffirm the spirit and principles of the Charter and strengthen the world's confidence in it by taking specific steps to impel all States to support it in its struggle against racist and colonialist regimes and its material support of peoples still, struggling to recover their freedom and independence.
110.	The process of decolonization as defined by the United Nations has in the course of the last decade helped many peoples of the third world more or less peacefully to recover their nationhood, to reconstitute their territorial integrity and to join the international community, bringing to it their deep conviction as to the primacy of peaceful settlement for all problems   even where their rights are self-evident and their highest interests directly at stake.
111.	Morocco has completely endorsed the value of this process and the virtues of this method. Since the proclamation of its independence, my country has patiently pursued the settlement of outstanding problems, particularly with Spain. In so doing, we have been prompted by the desire to maintain our age-old historical links with our neighbor to the north and to build the closest possible cooperation for the future, in respect for our many mutual interests. No one was happier that we were to see Spain in its turn quit the dwindling group of Powers opposed to the freedom of colonial peoples and formally give its support to the principle of self-determination, which it has actually implemented in Equatorial Guinea. Unfortunately, so called Spanish Sahara continues to be denied the benefits of this principle. Nevertheless, for several years now the United Nations has been adopting resolutions on the future of the Territory and has urged Spain to apply these resolutions which it has always supported.
112.	In the spirit of these resolutions and the better, to facilitate their implementation, Morocco and its neighbors concerned for the peace of the region and development of cooperation among themselves have decided to do everything possible to facilitate the application of self-determination to the Sahara, in collaboration with the United Nations and the administering Power. But we deeply regret the negative attitude of the Spanish Government whose policy in the Sahara gives ground for daily growing anxiety and ever increasing doubt as to its sincerity about applying the resolutions. Spain is called upon, within the framework and the terms repeatedly specified by the General Assembly, to hold a referendum giving the populations of the Sahara an opportunity freely to express their choice.
113.	However, no steps have been taken to reassure the populations, their neighbors and the United Nations as to Spain's intention to hold this referendum in the required conditions, that is to say, under the guarantees specified by the United Nations and restoring conditions in the Territory in which the indigenous populations and all Saharans   now temporarily exiled from the Territory by a climate of fear and coercive measures   may freely choose their future.
114.	For our part, we have consistently reiterated our determination to foster the most peaceful solutions, facilitating the Territory's transition from the status of a colonial country to that of freedom, in which the whole region and Spain can establish sincere cooperation to preserve the interests that are vital to the future of the whole region.
115.	Turning to the Asian continent, the prospects for peaceful settlement of other vestiges of the past seemed at one point to hold out the possibility of peace in SouthEast Asia. Unfortunately, the Paris talks, begun after such patient international effort, are now bogging down almost without hope of results in the near future. Meanwhile the war has spread to other countries of the region, making an approach to a solution far more complex and for the moment creating a situation with unforeseeable consequences.
116.	It is deplorable and even tragic that during this session of commemoration and stocktaking the international Organization is being bypassed in the search for a solution. It is only fitting to pay tribute to the courage of the SecretaryGeneral who has tirelessly endeavored to remind everyone whenever necessary of what the logical outcome of this situation must be if peace in Asia is to be restored and international security strengthened.
117.	On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the problem of disarmament constitutes a stumbling block to an international relaxation of tension. As the delegation of Morocco is a member of the Committee on Disarmament, it will set forth its views at length on this particularly important question during the debates in the First Committee. However, I feel I must make the point, albeit briefly, that there is a contradiction between the general desire to stop the arms race and the increasingly alarming progress of technology which with the development and the stockpiling of ever more dangerous weapons poses a growing threat to the survival of humanity. That is why we believe that the problem merits greater efforts by everyone to bring home to the Powers directly responsible that competition in this area has brought about a very special kind of crisis of confidence in the international community.
118.	Of course, certain treaties on some aspects of disarmament have been signed and the dynamics of that process might, if we remain constant in our efforts, broaden agreement to other aspects of the problem, thereby realizing the universal desire to achieve agreement on general and complete disarmament in the course of this decade. In that spirit, the Government of His Majesty the King submitted the instruments of ratification to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] and acceded to the Geneva Protocol of 1925 banning chemical and bacteriological weapons. During the debate in the Disarmament Committee in Geneva our delegation, in a series of suggestions, contributed to the draft treaty on the partial demilitarization of the seabed , and we earnestly hope that the First Committee will endorse that draft treaty.
119.	The problem ^f. international security seems to us to be increasingly related to progress on disarmament. Indeed, it is impossible to speak seriously of establishing international conditions favorable to security without eliminating, or at least reducing as much as possible, political considerations which have given rise to the arms race. It is true that that question is not the only one which requires an appropriate and rapid solution to speed up the process of reducing antagonism and to bring about conditions conducive to a universal dialog on the problem of international security. Last year the delegation of Morocco set forth in the First Committee [1667th meeting] certain considerations, which were brought to mind as the result of the present state of international affairs and potential conflicts which are serious obstacles to progress and need to be removed, to restore that confidence which is indispensable at all levels of the international community.
120.	In fact, however, an understanding between the great Powers alone is not sufficient grounds for optimism on the prospects of peace in the world. Even such an understanding, if it were based only on the idea of replacing the concept of confrontation with that of hegemony, would be not only inadequate but would also constitute a particularly serious danger to the rest of the international community. We can be justly proud of progress being made in any area of the world to put an end to a conflict or to reduce tensions. However, to be truly international a relaxation of tension must be contagious and encompass all continents. In that connexion and in so far as the situation in Europe directly after the Second World War constituted one of the major obstacles to the solution of problems arising from the war itself, we welcome the signing of the Moscow Treaty on the non-use of force between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union. That Treaty opens the door to the settlement of a number of problems which arose in the area in 1945 to which a peaceful solution now seems feasible.
121.	Is it necessary to say that a solution to political problems cannot alone bring about miracles and usher in an era of understanding and harmony after a quarter of a century of more or less constant crises? The existing economic and social disequilibrium between the continents continues, in our opinion, to be a fundamental obstacle to efforts to bring about a permanent relaxation of tension. Many Powers do not seem to give that reality the attention it nevertheless deserves. A minority maintains and still has in its hands the economic potential of the entire world and therefore determines the future of the rest of mankind. This situation requires permanent and effective action in order to ensure a change of direction in international relations.
122.	The disparity in economic and social development requires the same struggle as the one being waged to do away with political supremacy. It is not impossible that a widespread effort may ensure in the not too distant future the replacement of domination and exploitation by cooperation and assistance. We are convinced that such problems will find some of the necessary solutions within the framework of equal exchanges at the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels. We firmly believe that while such cooperation may seem remote at the international level, its realization on the regional plane would constitute an effective encouragement.
123.	We are pleased that this idea, which we have constantly put forward in all the organizations in which Morocco is a member, was clearly enunciated in the Organization of African Unity and the Conference of nonaligned countries at Lusaka.
124.	In this connexion, we believe that the question of the use of the seabed and the ocean floor for peaceful purposes must be an indispensable corollary to that international cooperation. The idea of a common heritage which is supported by most States is one which we also agree with, as indeed we agree with the principles that the resources obtained from the exploitation of the seabed and the ocean floor must be considered the heritage of all mankind. Although we are today pleased that those principles are broadly shared, it remains no less necessary to reach agreement on a clear and precise definition of the limits of the continental shelf and of the areas where sovereignty and national jurisdiction may be exercised. In this connexion, a reexamination of the 1958 Geneva Convention on the continental shelf seems to us to be necessary, and the delegation of Morocco would join many delegations which would like to see that international instrument brought more into line with present day realities of which the developing countries in particular have become keenly aware as a result of the progress made in the field of research and underwater exploration.
125.	The considerations I have just set forth on international security, disarmament, economic development and international cooperation were at the forefront of the Lusaka meeting of the Heads of State or Government of nonaligned countries. They underline the devotion of the participating countries to the conditions needed to ensure their unity and harmony in international relations. They also demonstrate their determination to make a broader contribution to the general effort to reduce the causes of international tension in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.
126.	The primary political result of the Lusaka meeting was to call in question again the present structures of the international community dominated as it is by the great Powers and characterized by political, economic and racial barriers which obstruct the determination of a large segment of the world's population to improve the quality of life for the individual and ensure that nations will develop free from oppression, insecurity and anxiety.
127.	It continues to be our profound belief that in spite of everything, the United Nations constitutes an instrument capable of protecting the international moral principles which were proclaimed 25 years ago.
128.	It is the special responsibility of the permanent members of the Security Council to be the first to maintain and promote the rule of law and to promote and ensure respect among States. Only such an attitude can encourage the small and medium-sized Powers, which form the majority in this Organization, to maintain their confidence.
129.	In spite of the wars and tragedies which beset our strife-torn world, we wish once again to express to our Organization, on the occasion of its historic commemoration, our confidence and our support. We wholeheartedly hope that the theme of this twenty- fifth anniversary, 'Peace, justice and progress', will be henceforth the sole objective and the main source of inspiration of mankind, as much in its thoughts as in its actions.



"
25,1970,AUT,"155.	  May I begin by expressing to Ambassador Hambro, on behalf of the delegation of Austria, our best wishes on his election as President of this General Assembly.
156.	We derive great satisfaction from the knowledge that this twenty-fifth session of the United Nations will be held under the Presidency of a man whom we not only admire as an experienced diplomat, but whose background and personality are so germane to the problems and the respect of international law. This may be quite significant at a time when national and international systems of law are exposed to increased attacks and hard tests.
157.	As representatives of a European State, we are also happy to see that this twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly happens to be held under a President from our continent. Starting with the first General Assembly of 1946, which convened under the presidency of that European statesman of genuine greatness Paul-Henri Spaak and up to this twenty-fifth anniversary session, a chain of outstanding personalities coming from all continents has presided over our Assembly. The President of this session is continuing this illustrious tradition.
158.	I also wish to use this opportunity to express the sincere gratitude of the Austrian delegation to Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph, President of last year's General Assembly.
159.	A tragic event of the first magnitude has cast a dark shadow on our deliberations. President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic died suddenly on Monday of this week. In him his own country has lost an outstanding leader and the world a statesman who, by opting for a ceasefire followed by negotiations, rekindled the hopes of millions for a peaceful solution of the Near East conflict. We bow our heads to the memory of a great man and extend our heartfelt sympathy to the people of the United Arab Republic in their great bereavement.
160.	The twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, which came into being after the end of the Second World War out of a genuine desire to free future generations from the scourge of war, is an occasion to consider what has been achieved and also what has been left undone so far; an occasion to examine our conscience and to ask whether each Member State has really made a due contribution to the peaceful cooperation of the peoples of the world, I believe that it should always be borne in mind that the United Nations can successfully exploit the possibilities open to it by the Charter only within the boundaries set for it by the will of all Member States, and especially by the great Powers.
161.	Looking back at the developments of the last twenty-five years one is entitled to ask to what extent have we shown respect for the fundamental principles of international law and acted in the spirit of the Charter? Have we, the States Members of this Organization, really refrained in our international relations from the use or the threat of force against the territorial integrity or the political independence of other States? Have the Member States always settled international disputes by peaceful means and in such a way as not to endanger international security and justice? Has the principle been applied that no State should interfere in the domestic affairs of another State? Has the principle of the equality of sovereign States and their peoples and their right to self determination been observed? And, finally, have the States cited out in good faith the obligations assumed under the United Nations Charter?
162.	We must acknowledge, regretfully, that there is a flagrant discrepancy between the present international situation and those principles of the Charter and of international law which should have governed friendly relations among States. While we make speeches here, people are fighting and dying in SouthEast Asia and in the Middle East. Horrible acts of air piracy, kidnapping and murder of innocent hostages are increasing in a frightening way. The rules of international law, the principles of the Charter and human rights are trodden underfoot daily and real or imaginary wrongs are avenged by new lawlessness.
163.	I believe that this situation, which is of grave concern, can be resolved only if we find our way back to that deep and sincere desire for peace which filled all the nations of the world at the end of the last great war, and if we make the principles of the United Nations Charter the guideline for our conduct. Just as in the domestic life of a State, mutual tolerance must be exercised in relations between communities, as advocated by Comenius the 300th anniversary of whose death is being commemorated this year  when he said:
'No State receives internal peace as a free gift; it is the expression of mutual give and take, of self restraint, of freedom based on equal and inalienable rights and the dignity inherent in all men. The same applies to external peace: it will not just drop into one's lap without mutual give and take, self-restraint and continuous effort.'
164.	Austria, as a permanently neutral State whose national security is closely linked to international stability, is vitally interested in all measures conducive to the strengthening of international security; accordingly, we welcomed the debate at the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly on the item entitled 'Strengthening of international security' and conveyed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations our position and proposals on that item [A 17922]. To come closer to that objective of international security, it is first necessary to strengthen the United Nations as the most important institution for the preservation of world peace and to support it in the fulfillment of its task. The current anniversary session of the General Assembly provides a welcome opportunity to that end,,
165.	Peace on our planet will be attainable only if each individual State makes its contribution to that end by endeavoring to solve, in the spirit of the Charter, all problems arising with its neighboring States and within its region.
166.	Since Europe, too, is not free of such tensions and since Austria has a natural interest in a detente, it welcomed the recent signing of a treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union  as an encouraging beginning. It also welcomed the proposal to hold a conference to deal with questions of security and cooperation in Europe. In a series of bilateral talks with interested States, Austria has endeavored to make its contribution to the creation of a generally acceptable basis for such a conference. Austria has outlined its position in a memorandum addressed to all interested States.
167.	A minimum of trust is a prerequisite for all cooperation and the foundation for the success of any conference. The best way to build trust remains the fulfillment of treaties and respect for United Nations resolutions. In this connexion it is a source of great satisfaction for me to be able to report to this Assembly on a problem which, in accordance with two resolutions of the General Assembly, it was possible to move appreciably closer to a solution during the last year, namely, the question of South Tirol.

168.	By its resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI) the General Assembly has called upon Austria and Italy to resume negotiations on the implementation of the Paris Agreement of 5 September 1946. which regulates the status of the German-speaking population of the Province of Bozen and establishes a system designed to guarantee to the German-speaking inhabitants of the Province of Bozen 'complete equality of rights with the Italian-speaking inhabitants, within the framework of special provisions to safeguard the ethnical character and the cultural and economic development of the German-speaking element'.  The talks were to be resumed with the objective of finding a solution to all differences related to the implementation of the aforementioned agreement.
169.	Last year, after nine years of effort, Austria and Italy worked out a proposal for a solution which has received, on a democratic basis, the approval of the elected representatives of the people both in Austria and Italy as well as that of the South Tirolean minority. The two Governments have conveyed this information to the States Members of the United Nations through the SecretaryGeneral in documents A/7927 and A/7928 of 22 July 1970.
170.	While the proposed solution could not be based on a reconciliation between the legal positions of the parties concerned, it provides nevertheless for a number of steps to be taken by the Austrian and Italian sides in accordance with a timetable called 'calendar of operations'. Within its framework and by means of a constitutional law, ordinary laws, executive regulations to the constitutional law and administrative decrees, Italy committed itself to granting a number of legislative and administrative rights to the province of Bo wn the homeland of the South Tiroleans thus expanding the autonomy of that minority.
171.	The administrative decrees provided under this timetable of operations have already been issued. The constitutional law was introduced into the Chamber of Deputies by the Italian Government at the beginning of this year and is now under parliamentary consideration. The ordinary laws should be submitted to the Italian Parliament before the end of this year. It is our sincere hope, and we are encouraged therein by the Government declaration of Prime Minister Colombo on 10 August 1970, that the parliamentary procedures for the projected legislation will not consume too much time, so that its positive political effects may not be impaired by excessive delay.
172.	As soon as the measures enumerated and described in detail in the official annex to the Italian Government declaration of 3 December 1969, which were noted with approval by the Austrian Parliament at its meeting of 16 December 1969, and which are to be incorporated in a Constitutional Law, ordinary laws and executive regulations to the Constitutional Law, become legally valid in South Tirol, Austria will declare that it considers as terminated the dispute which was the subject of the aforementioned resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
173.	Hand in hand with the implementation of measures in favor of the South Tirolean minority in Italy, an agreement between Austria and Italy will be signed and submitted to the ratification procedures and, after completion of these steps, will come into force. This will make the provisions of Chapter 1 of the European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes  applicable, in the relations between Austria and Italy, to disputes concerning the interpretation and implementation of bilateral agreements in force between the two parties, also in those cases where disputes refer to facts or situations prior to the coming into force of the aforementioned European convention between the two States.
174.	I am happy to acknowledge that, through the new regulation envisaged for autonomy in South Tirol, a cornerstone was laid for a renewed and fruitful cooperation between the two neighboring countries, Austria and Italy. The Austrian Government is firmly
8 Signed in Strasbourg on 29 April 1957 under the auspice'; of the Council of Europe.
resolved to honor its commitments under the proposed solution. At the same time, it confidently trusts that Italy will make its contribution to the further development of friendly and rewarding relations between our two countries by a speedy implementation, in letter and spirit, of the measures envisaged, and also by following a policy of understanding in respect of the South Tirolean ethnic group. Austria is sincerely interested in such a development.
175.	Notwithstanding the efforts by European States to arrive at a lessening of tensions and to achieve closer cooperation, the overall political picture of our world remains clouded. It is an undeniable fact that it has not become possible to put an end to warfare in the Middle East and in SouthEast Asia, or even to reduce the hazards the situation in the Middle East presents to world peace. There was no lack of earnest endeavor from various sides. In particular one has to rate highly the efforts deployed by the great Powers to reach a formula acceptable to all parties for settling the differences in the IsraeliArab conflict. The ceasefire and the renewed search for a political solution to the conflict through the interposition of the United Nations mediator, Ambassador Gunnar Jarring, were overshadowed by the sanguinary battles fought in Jordan. In the long run, however, the only hope for a solution would seem to lie in a settlement of the deeply rooted differences among the peoples of the Middle East by peaceful means. Austria is convinced that the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967 [242 (1967)] points to a way that would lead to a peaceful coexistence of the peoples of that area, a region so rich in cultural heritage and economic potential. Austria is prepared to continue its contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping operations in that area and is also willing, whenever it is deemed desirable, to provide observers or contingents even on a larger scale.
176.	The war in VietNam goes on and in the course of this year has even spread over a wider area because of the hostilities in Cambodia. While here, too, efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement and a deescalation of military actions should not be overlooked, we cannot refrain from expressing this year again, our serious concern at the continuation of the armed conflict.
177.	We hope that in the face of the continuing human suffering and of the apparent deadlock in this horrible war, all sides will eventually realize that here too a political solution and the use of peaceful means can alone lead to a settlement, a suitable basis for which may be provided by the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and 1962. We have to realize that all planning for the future would be pointless, that we would lack credibility unless we succeeded in settling problems of this scope and urgency.
178.	Among the grave problems confronting us, I should now like to point with purpose to those occurrences which not only represent a retreat from the fundamental rules of a civilized world, but which may also become a serious threat to the maintenance of peace. I am referring to the increasingly frequent acts of air piracy and bombing attempts against civil aircraft in flight, as well as to the abuse and even slaughter of innocent hostages to enforce political ends. I agree entirely with SecretaryGeneral U Thant when he calls such acts savage and inhuman and asks for effective international measures to prevent the perpetration and spreading of these crimes.
179.	In the light of our interest in the strengthening of international security, Austria follows the development of the disarmament talks with the greatest attention. I should like to express here our satisfaction that the two superPowers found themselves ready to engage in negotiations on the limitation of strategic weapons. The fact that the latest phase of these talks was held in Vienna underscores anew the relevance of a permanently neutral State as a venue for such meetings. May I express the hope that the continuation of these talks will lead to concrete agreements whereby the threat of an atomic devastation of our planet would be at least diminished, if not altogether removed.
180.	At the same time I should like to emphasize the significance of multilateral disarmament efforts which have worldwide disarmament measures as their objective. The coming into force of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] in march of this year was certainly an important step forward. Austria, one of the first countries to ratify this Treaty, appeals to those States which have not yet decided to do so to accede to it, despite the perhaps not entirely balanced commitments between the nuclear and the nonnuclear States. Austria also welcomed the fact that important tasks relating to the implementation of the Treaty were referred to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.
181.	The complexity of the question of disarmament is directly related to the revolutionary progress in science and technology. It is therefore logical that in the last years the United Nations has increasingly directed its attention to the long-range problems which are closely linked to this technical evolution. I am referring here mainly to the practical applications of space technology which are likely to change our daily life in the future. I should also mention, in this context, the attempts to institute a legal system for outer space and the ocean floor and, last but not least, the efforts of the United Nations to preserve the human environment.
182.	Despite an encouraging start in the area of legal arrangements for outer space, a slowdown may now be observed in this work. Nor have the efforts to set forth a declaration of principles for the seabed, so far, achieved the desired goal. This immobility must be overcome because, not only in theoretical but also in practical terms, legislative action of the United Nations in these two fields appears to contribute constructively to the future evolution of the world Organization.
183.	The technological, scientific and also political developments of the last decades have made the interdependence of human activity all over the globe even clearer. This is evident in the political and, perhaps
even more so, in the economic field. Accordingly, industrial States must take into account, 'n their economic policies, the interests of the developing countries. The United Nations and its subsidiary agencies on their part should carry out the technical preliminary work necessary for a better understanding of the increasing needs and also for the coordination and execution of the various programs. The Second United Nations Development Decade, approved by the twenty-first session of the General Assembly and designed to reduce the gap between the poor and the rich by promoting the economic growth of the developing countries, thus acquires particular significance. Austria will make its contribution to the goals of this decade and within the limits of its economic possibilities will in particular make every effort to achieve, during that period, a volume of development assistance equivalent to 1 per cent of its gross national product.
184.	The presence in Vienna of important United Nations institutions, particularly the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and the holding in our country of numerous international conferences underline once again the importance which we attach to the Development Decade. In this regard I wish to point out that the Austrian Government incurred very substantial expenses to provide UNIDO with fully adequate working premises mainly through new construction   and we are proud to note that our efforts in this direction were rewarded by the appreciation expressed from all sides, including the Secretary General.
185.	Regarding the establishment of a United Nations , city in Vienna, which would serve as headquarters for
the organizations already located there, as well as those that would wish to move to Vienna in future, an international competition of urban architecture has now been completed. The projects selected by the jury are now being examined by the Austrian Government in respect of their feasibility, and it may be expected that a decision on the project to be adopted will be made, in consultation with IAEA and UNIDO, even before the end of this year. Austria hopes that by providing the financial support for this undertaking it will make a further valuable contribution towards the attainment of the objectives of the Development Decade.
186.	I should like now to point to two more subjects which, in our view, deserve particular attention on the part of the United Nations. I am referring to the fact that the uses and the significance of data processing in economy, education, administration and science have grown to such an extent that individual States can no longer, by themselves, keep pace with this development. At the same time a situation should be avoided in which, because of higher technical capability, individual States or groups of States acquire a monopoly in this important field. The Austrian Association for Data Processing therefore submitted some time ago a memorandum to SecretaryGeneral U Thant, which contains a proposal for the setting up of a central service for the processing and exchange of data within the United Nations framework and which, in addition to the processing of the material,
would also have the task of carrying out an objective evaluation of all the data on the basis of unified standards, thus preventing possible manipulations.
187.	The second thought I wanted to submit is that, in view of the continuously increasing demands on national administrations and on the secretariats of international organizations, the problem of the auditing of these administrations acquires a growing significance. Austria is happy to be host in Vienna to the International Secretariat of the Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions, which has set itself the task of promoting principles of efficient administrative controls through periodic exchange of experience. In accordance with a wish often expressed by developing countries a seminar has been planned within the framework of that Organization's activities, to be conducted in Austria in the spring of 1971, with assistance from the United Nations Development Program, which will deal with State audit problems at the highest level, with particular emphasis on problems peculiar to developing countries.
188.	In conclusion, I should like to go back once again to the phenomenon of the increasing acts of violence occurring both in international and national life. According to Art 1, paragraph 1 of the Charter, the primary purpose of the United Nations is to settle international disputes and situations which may lead to a breach of peace by peaceful means and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law. It would therefore be correct to say that the United Nations is built on the principle of 'peace through law'.
189.	The external peace to be ensured in accordance with that principle necessarily implies internal peace within the members of the family of nations as its prerequisite. That internal peace cannot exist, in the long run, inside a State which does not respect the fundamental rights of the person, which are also consecrated by the Charter of the United Nations. Human rights and fundamental freedoms can no longer be exclusively regarded today as the classic rights which we may find in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December 1948.
190.	The principle of the equality of all men has since been expanded by the codifying activities of the United Nations, aimed at preventing all forms of racial discrimination. Discrimination based on the color of the skin or on ethnic origin, such as we find it today in particular in southern Africa, is therefore liable to compromise external peace. The Austrian Government has repeatedly stated that it rejects the concept of apartheid, which is contrary to the Charter, just as it rejects every other political concept based on racial, religious or ethnic discrimination. I wish to restate this position of ours most emphatically and to stress, in this context, that in the opinion of Austria, the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa, which was endorsed by the twenty-fourth General Assembly, points to a practicable way towards the implementation of the Declaration on decolonization adopted ten years ago.
191.	The developments in southern Africa are the more alarming since the discriminatory policies, condemned by the whole world, are spreading to an area which by virtue of decisions of this Organization had been placed under the direct responsibility of the United Nations. The inhabitants of Namibia must be given the right freely to determine their future, just as all the other peoples of the world.
192.	In connexion with this problem we welcome the decision of the Security Council reflected in its resolution 284 (1970) of 29 July 1970, which requests an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice regarding 'the legal consequences for States of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia, notwithstanding Security Council resolution 276 (1970)'. One hopes that the advisory opinion to be handed down by the International Court of Justice will bring this Organization one step nearer to the solution of the Namibian problem.
193.	In this connexion, it would seem appropriate for me to say a few words about the International Court itself. We believe that the proposals submitted to the General Assembly to review the role of the Court deserve close study. Those proposals are designed to expand the sphere of action of the Court, and in that context more emphasis could be placed on the concept of the peaceful settlement of disputes. Especially interesting is the idea of setting up regional chambers of the Court which could be used for the settlement of disputes within a given region. To stress the significance which Austria attaches to the role of the International Court of Justice, I should like to state here that the Federal Government of Austria has decided, during these last days, to introduce a bill in Parliament which would provide for the issuance of a declaration under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, according to which Austria will recognize the jurisdiction of the Court as 'compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement, in relation to any other State accepting the same obligation'.
194.	I have focused my remarks more specifically on the aspects of international security and the maintenance of law and order in the world. This in no way means that we underrate the significance of other problems. I am, however, firmly convinced that a firm re-dedication by all Member States to the principle of friendly relations and cooperation among nations would be an essential step to bring us nearer to peace and to the solution of all pending problems.
195.	We must learn from the past that peace, justice and progress form an indivisible whole and constitute as such the condition sine qua non for the survival of mankind.




"
25,1970,NZL,"180.	 At the outset, I should like to refer to the dark shadow which the tragic and untimely death of President Gamal Abdel Nasser has cast over this Assembly and the world. In a statement made in Wellington yesterday, my Prime Minister referred to the late President as one of the most significant political figures of the post Second World War era. He was a constant source of inspiration to his people and he helped to mold and fortify a new sense of national identity and dignity.
181.	The profound sympathy of the people of New Zealand has already been conveyed to the Government and people of the United Arab Republic. To the delegation of the United Arab Republic, I should like to add my own expression of deep sympathy at the tragic loss suffered by the Egyptian and, indeed, by all the Arab peoples.
182.	President Nasser's statesmanlike acceptance of the American proposals had raised hopes that the long awaited negotiations might at last have begun. We must all hope that his generous spirit will prevail and that peace will soon come to this troubled area of the world.
183.	Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to congratulate the incoming President of this Assembly. It is a singular pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, a representative of a country which sat with New Zealand at San Francisco, on the honor of presiding over the session which takes place in this twenty-fifth anniversary year. Your career has been marked by your close association with the advancement of international law and of this Organization. It is a fitting symbol that the direction of this session should have been placed in your hands at a time when the world needs from the United Nations a strong and renewed assertion of the rule of law. I also take this opportunity to pay a well-merited compliment to your distinguished predecessor in office, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph of Liberia.
184.	May I also at this point say how much New Zealand looks forward to welcoming Fiji a South Pacific country with which New Zealand has many close associations to membership in the early part of this twenty-fifth session.
185.	There are many features of the world situation today which could not have been foreseen at San Francisco, even though the Charter adopted there contained a wealth of insight, and has proved to be an instrument of great flexibility. But one must ask as well whether some of our purposes in banding together in the United Nations have not been neglected to the point where confidence in the Organization is gravely diminished.
186.	Who could have foreseen that, as a backdrop to the opening of the twenty-fifth anniversary session, we should have the spectacle of international piracy, the spectacle of nations held to ransom and subjected to blackmail by those whom we treat too respectfully by using the term 'hijackers'. We must place this in conjunction with another remarkable phenomenon: the lightning rapidity with which the shock waves of events, and particularly of violent events, are felt around the world in this age of instant communication. We cannot allow the epidemic of hijacking to be condoned. It is, I suggest, time to combat the ingenuity and ruthlessness of those who use such methods to serve their own political or personal ends. Hundreds of years ago, international law was equal to the challenge posed by piracy on the high seas.
187.	Today all the nations of a technologically advanced world will need to use all their skill and determination to stamp out the scourge of piracy in the air.
188.	In a recent address the SecretaryGeneral proposed that all nations should pledge to extradite hijackers, irrespective of their nationality or political affiliation, for trial before an agreed international tribunal. My Government welcomes the boldness of the SecretaryGeneral's approach. It believes that strong measures are required. It urges all Governments to give the most serious consideration to international action which would effectively put a stop to hijacking. Important work to this end is being undertaken in the International Civil Aviation Organization, but there may well be room for this Assembly to encourage and accelerate this urgent task.
189.	The communications revolution to which I have referred is one of the reasons why in recent years vast problems of global dimensions have been perceived so much more rapidly and universally than in the past.
190.	The United Nations today is applying itself to these problems. The solutions which are found will determine for us and future generations the quality of life. They will also be a mark of the vigor and adaptability of our Organization.
191.	The relationship between population and development is one of these problems. Its solution is essentially dependent on decisions taken at the national level within the framework of the circumstances of each country, including its economic structure and its social and spiritual aspirations. But there exists also a global responsibility. The United Nations, through its Population Commission and its Population Fund, has an important role to play in focusing attention on the world problem and in providing assistance to countries which seek it.
192.	The scope for international action to conserve the human environment is even more obvious. New Zealand, as a country in an early stage of industrial development and in an isolated geographical position, does not have the acute problems experienced by more heavily industrialized and populated countries. We have had, none the less, to develop active policies in such fields as land conservation, and are conscious of the growing risks of pollution of various kinds. A national organization in the form of an Environmental Council has been set up, and New Zealand is anxious to contribute to work in this field through participation in the Stockholm conference,  in the specialized agencies and, as we hope, in the Economic and Social Council.
193.	Of equal importance and of special interest to New Zealand is the question of establishing a just and effective regime for the deep seabed. There are fewer than ten countries with a longer coastline than New Zealand. We are isolated and surrounded by a vast area of ocean. By any definition we have an exceptionally large continental shelf. In short, we have as great a stake as any other Member of the United Nations in the work of the seabed Committee. 
194.	All these questions of global scope relate to the work of the United Nations on development generally, and all Members stand to benefit from this work.
195.	We recognize and respect the fact that for the great majority of delegations the overriding preoccupation is with the mainstream of economic development. The preparations for the Second United Nations
Development Decade, to which priority has been accorded at this session, have come to be regarded as a touchstone, and attitudes to it as a test of good faith. As my Prime Minister said in this debate last year, the first Development Decade taught that sound economic development is a continuous, complex ana longterm process in which the willing cooperation of all developed and developing countries is essential. We continue to believe that it is correspondingly important that the goals or targets set should be realistic. The New Zealand Government has stated its readiness to work towards the target of one per cent of gross national product for external aid. Its ability to do so, however, is in strict relation to its ability to maintain and expand the level of its exports, consisting almost exclusively of primary commodities. This is a factor which my Government hopes will be borne in mind during consideration of international commodity arrangements for the forthcoming decade. There is nothing unique in the problems which particular countries face. It is only by approaching them together in a spirit of common aspiration that the highest factor of benefit to all can be achieved.
196.	The opportunity to pursue a common approach to international trade problems arises most obviously through regional economic groupings. The potential for development which these can present has been amply demonstrated. Caution is needed, however, to ensure that benefits accrue both within the grouping and in trade with the outside world. The net result must not be to inhibit external trade through the growth of restrictive trade practices and protectionism.
197.	For New Zealand the problem is far from theoretical. For a decade it has faced the prospect of seeing its largest market, the United Kingdom, become part of the world's most powerful regional economic grouping, the European Economic Community. In spite of our continuing efforts to find new export markets, the British market still represents the only outlet for nearly half New Zealand's total exports and almost all our exports of certain key agricultural products. Now that negotiations for British entry to the European Economic Community have begun, my Government is confident that New Zealand's position has the full sympathy and understanding of all parties concerned and that adequate safeguards to enable this trade to continue will be adopted. In a very real sense the role of regional groupings in world trade is on trial in this test case. New Zealand appreciates and fully supports the motivations behind the drive for a united Europe which could be so powerful a force for good in the world. However, it would be tragic if, as a result of enlarging the European Economic Community, one of the world's most efficient agricultural producers were driven to the wall. This would be a sad irony in a world facing grave potential shortages of food.
198.	I have devoted my remarks thus far to economic and social questions and to some of the new areas in which the United Nations is active. It would be a mistake, however, to believe that in pursuing these important questions the United Nations is achieving the primary objectives of the Charter. As my Prime
Minister suggested last year [1757th meetingJ, we are all to some extent guilty of self-delusion for as long as we fail to achieve the essential goal of international peace and stability.
199. The occasion of the commemorative session will, I hope, provide an opportunity for an analysis of some of the reasons for the Organization's inability to control international conflicts and of steps which might lead towards the diplomatic reactivation of the United Nations. This was a theme stressed by the Foreign Minister of Brazil in the traditionally eloquent intervention with which he opened our general debate [1841st meeting].
200.	In one critical area the Middle East we have followed the patient efforts of Ambassador Jarring on behalf of the United Nations. We fervently hope that the cautious expectations engendered by the United States peace initiative, and by the stated willingness of the parties to enter into negotiations, have suffered only a temporary setback. It seems to us that the minimum conditions for further progress towards a settlement are an agreed extension of the ceasefire and the resumption within that time of endeavors to bring the parties to negotiations. In these endeavors the four permanent members of the Security Council will doubtless have to play a continuing, honest and persuasive role in accordance with the principles of the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967 [242 (1967)].
201.	In relation to the VietNam war, however, the failure of the United Nations to play any real part is notorious and a matter of regret. The last four months have seen the involvement in that war, from no volition of its own, of a small country which has consistently sought to avoid such involvement. My delegation asks this Assembly today whether it will choose to remain indifferent to the situation in Cambodia, which has deeply concerned my Government.
202.	From the outset Cambodia refused to take sides in the VietNam conflict and tried to prevent the war from spilling across its borders, but in vain. Over a period of years the armed forces of North VietNam and the VietCong took advantage of Cambodia's neutrality to establish bases and supplylines within its territory. The then Head of State of Cambodia, Prince Sihanouk, became increasingly alarmed at that situation but was unable to persuade the North VietNamese to withdraw their forces. In March 1970 he was dismissed as Head of State by a unanimous vote of the Cambodian Parliament. The Government of General Lon Nol, which Prince Sihanouk himself had appointed, demanded the withdrawal of the communist forces, while making clear that it was prepared to negotiate on the question. Instead of taking up that offer, the communist forces immediately began to attack the forces and installations of the Government of Cambodia to make war on the country whose territory they were already making free of,
203.	That action of the North VietNamese was a clear case of aggression, of an attack on one State by the armed forces of another. It has continued right up to the present time. Indeed the communist forces have expanded their activities throughout Cambodia and have virtually annexed a large part of it. They have, it is true, used the name of the deposed Prince Sihanouk as a cover, but the forces involved in the fighting have been almost entirely VietNamese, either North VietNamese or VietCong.
204.	Some time after the communist forces had begun to attack the Cambodian Government forces, the forces of South VietNam and the United States launched a series of operations across the South VietNamese border into Cambodia. These were designed to destroy the bases from which the communist forces had so long operated with impunity against Saigon and the surrounding areas. They were welcomed by General Lon Nol and undoubtedly helped him to survive the military pressure that the North VietNamese and their supporters were putting on him. But it should be noted that the Cambodian Government had previously appealed in vain for help to the Geneva Conference coChairmen, to the members of the International Control Commission, and to this Organization. The Security Council took no effective action to deal with this clearcut case of North VietNamese aggression in Cambodia and there is no sign that it will do so.
205.	Cambodia's neighbors were more forthcoming. The Foreign Ministers of eleven Asian and Pacific countries, including New Zealand, met in Djakarta on 16 and 17 May and expressed grave concern over the situation in Cambodia. They called for an end to all hostilities there and for the withdrawal of all foreign forces. They also recommended the reactivation of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia and supported the idea of an international conference to consider the Cambodian problem. The moderation of the Djakarta Conference was widely recognized and its outcome met with the approval of many countries which were not represented at it. Yet it was condemned out of hand by North VietNam and by Communist China, and it evoked no positive response from the Soviet Union.
206.	The Djakarta Conference was a remarkable demonstration of regional solidarity. My Government attaches great importance to the development of regional cooperation in Asia and we welcome the determination of the countries in the area to find an Asian solution for an Asian problem. We are confident that the spirit of the Conference will persist in spite of the hostile reaction from some quarters.
207.	But regional cooperation is no substitute for action on a wider basis, and the fact that action is being taken regionally is not a reason for the international community to do nothing. The great Powers  and in particular the Soviet Union and Communist China bear a heavy responsibility for the continuation and extension of the conflict in IndoChina, and no settlement can be reached without their collaboration. But what is even more relevant in this Assembly is that the fate of Cambodia is a matter of concern to small nations everywhere. All of us have an interest in ensuring that a small country cannot be invaded and attacked by stronger neighbors under whatever pretext. This Assembly may not be able to do much on its own to end the conflict and restore the integrity and neutrality of Cambodia. But that is no excuse for indifference. At the very least, the Members of this Assembly should take heed of the true nature and the implications of the situation with which the people of Cambodia are confronted.
208.	There is one other related matter I would briefly add, on which this Assembly has a humanitarian duty to fulfill. I refer to the fate of those prisoners of war held by the North VietNamese. The appeals of the International Red Cross, meeting at Istanbul in September 1969, and the reiterated efforts made by the International Committee of the Red Cross have elicited no response. Yet all that is sought is that these men be treated in accordance with international humanitarian law and, more specifically, that North VietNam honor the minimum undertakings which it gave in ar ceding to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. There is an inhumanity in the attitude displayed which must awaken this Assembly's deepest concern. How can it deal sincerely with an item such as that on human rights in armed conflicts without renewing at the solemn level of the General Assembly the appeals already made?
209.	Consideration of the ability of the Organization to discharge its responsibilities in the field of peace and security leads on to wider questions. How adequate is the structure of the United Nations to permit it to perform its functions in this twenty-fifth year of its existence? That is a matter which requires examination on two different levels. We are all conscious of the problems involved in proposals for the Charter review. The best must not, however, be the enemy of the good. If that wider reform should not prove possible, there is still scope for more modest and practical innovations. For that reason my delegation has joined in co sponsoring the item on the rationalization of the procedures and organization of the General Assembly.
210.	We do not approach this subject with preconceived ideas. We believe the Assembly could benefit from the recommendations which might come from a small group, rich in direct personal experience. We have in mind, for example, that the functioning of Assembly committees has become more formalized than was originally contemplated. Do they now serve their purpose in meeting as frequently as they do? There are a number of questions on which attitudes have become rigid. This, in turn, suggests that there may be a case for reviewing the agenda with a view to avoiding automatic inscription, or annual discussion, at least of those items where the outcome does not vary from one year to the next. How, on the one hand, can the Assembly's procedures be shaped to recognize the increasing practice of negotiation between, and within, groups which is now an abiding feature of the General Assembly and some other bodies? And how, on the other, can it be ensured that, in the larger forum of the General Assembly committees, countries which are not members of such specialized bodies as those dealing with outer space, disarmament, the seabed and the like, may still participate meaningfully in discussion of matters on which real negotiation tends to be restricted to an initiate circle? These are but some of the issues perhaps some of the more difficult issues which we should like to see debated.
211.	Finally, as part of a program to enable the Organization better to meet its responsibilities it is all too clear that its financial situation the precarious state of affairs with which the Organization has lived too long must be remedied. This is a matter to which our SecretaryGeneral has made pointed reference in the introduction to his annual report [A/8001/Add. 1 and Corr.l]. There is something incongruous about a world body which can stem insolvency only by borrowing. It is well to remind ourselves that the Organization is faced with a shortfall of some 190 million dollars in assessed contributions. It is surely not unreasonable to hope that those who perpetuate this situation could make a gesture in this anniversary year to help put the Organization back on a sound financial footing.
212.	The growth of the budget is a financial problem of a different order. The question must be asked whether the present rate of growth is not excessive. Growth must be accepted, but it must be carefully managed and apportioned to make the most effective use of our limited resources. In many countries, including my own, serious thought is being given to new forms of budget planning and presentation. We welcome the international studies carried out on this topic. There is much to be said for budgeting by program rather than by object of expenditure as at the present time.
213.	But technical measures of rationalization and consolidation are only part of the answer. What is needed above all is a willingness on the part of the membership as a whole to eliminate the conflict between what it wants and what it is prepared to pay. This is a basic conflict as much political as budgetary. The blame does not lie entirely with the Fifth Committee, which is largely ineffective in the face of the financial implications of substantive decisions. These decisions, often of a political nature, emanate from the legislative organs of the Assembly and the subsidiary bodies. Nor can the Secretariat, as the author of the budget document, be held solely responsible, nor indeed is inflation the sole culprit. It is we, the Member States, who hold apparently irreconcilable views about the desirable rate of growth, the level of overall expenditures and the use to which funds are put. As a consequence, no really effective budgetary control exists. This is a problem which the Secretary General himself has singled out in a plea for urgent action in his foreword to the budget estimates for 1971.
214.	While we must bear in mind the objectives of the Second Development Decade, a serious effort is needed in this year of stocktaking to reach common ground on these questions. The failure of the Committee on Conferences has illustrated an apparent absence of willingness effectively to empower an organ to exercise determined control. Surely we must deduce from this that there remains only the spirit of compromise if there is to be a healthy development of the budget, the administration of the Organization, and the programs which it services.
215.	I have dealt with some themes of current concern and with some pervasive questions of United Nations reform. All of us have, I am sure, been struck by the new strains to which international life is now subject, and with the correspondingly urgent need for our Organization both to strengthen its role in world order and to adjust itself to the times. In an address given in London some months ago our SecretaryGeneral said that:
'The news is so full of stories of conflict and violence that not enough attention is paid to the steady undercurrent of decency and commonsense in the affairs of nations, and people increasingly have the impression that in international affairs nothing ever goes right.'
216.	For New Zealand's part I urge that we all show in this anniversary year our determination to give effect to the spirit which at San Francisco gave rise to the Charter of the United Nations. Our Prime Minister then spoke of that historic conference as 'a moment of time which will not recur in our lives and which may not recur again'. Now, 25 years later, we have the opportunity and the necessity in this anniversary to take stock, and to add to the stature of the Organization. Let us use this chance."
25,1970,NLD,"141.	 As my opening remark I should like as many speakers have done before me to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph, for the able, distinguished and gracious manner in which she presided over our debates during the twenty-fourth session. She addressed wise words of counsel to us from the time she took her high office until the day she relinquished the Chair, and I feel, with many others in this hall, that the Assembly is indebted to her for her able guidance.
142.	It is likewise a matter of profound pleasure and satisfaction to me to pay the respects of my Government and my delegation to you, Sir, upon your election by this august body to the Presidency of the present historic session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Preceding speakers have recalled that your family has a distinguished record covering half a century of service in the interest of international peace, security, progress and respect for international law and order. If I may be allowed to strike a more personal note, I should like to add my warmest personal congratulations to you as an old friend and resident of the Netherlands and as an eminent representative of Norway, a country with which we have always had close and friendly relations in war and in peace and with which we confidently expect soon to be even more intimately linked within the framework of an enlarged European Economic Community.
143.	We feel that the enlargement of the Community is of the utmost importance not only to Western Europe but also as a result of the ensuing strengthening of our continent to the rest of the world. It has been the constant post-war policy of the Netherlands to help build a united Europe, and to us Europe means more than the Six. The nations now applying to become members of the Community are part and parcel of the economic, political and cultural fabric of our European commonwealth of nations which is only just becoming aware of its common heritage. I believe that we in Europe are now entering a complete new era which is sure to be of the greatest benefit to all mankind. Indeed, an enlarged European Community will be far better placed to promote world trade and therefore to be of assistance to the efforts of the developing countries to strengthen their economies. We are naturally aware of the anxieties in many parts of the world about possible protectionist tendencies of the European Community; I wish to assure this Assembly that the Netherlands, in concord with other European countries, will continue to strive for better trade conditions on a world-wide scale by promoting a general system of trade preferences for the developing countries.
144.	We realize that expanding trade is one aspect of overcoming the existing differences in economic development. Granting aid is another. At this time I do not wish to examine this subject, and the whole question of the Second United Nations Development Decade, at length. During the commemorative session the Netherlands Prime Minister will have the opportunity to elaborate on this subject, on which as a whole the Netherlands people, I feel proud to say, take a united, positive stand. My countrymen show this attitude in their many voluntary contributions to development projects, but as a member of the Government I should like to mention that in the budget presented to the Netherlands Parliament the goal to bring, official development aid in 1971 up to 1 per cent of the national income has been attained.
145.	In this session we are to celebrate the foundation of the United Nations 25 years ago. The Kingdom of the Netherlands, as one of the fighting members of the great alliance of the Second World War, was one of its founding fathers. The high hopes and great expectations we cherished at San Francisco in 1945 have not been realized. True, we have avoided a new world war, but time and again armed conflicts have broken out in various parts of the world. We have made big strides forward in the realization of independence and freedom for many peoples of the world, even if not for all, but at the same time the number of disputes, and often open conflicts, has increased. It seems to me that the voice of reason is frequently ignored. More often than not violence takes the upper hand, both inside our countries and on the international plane. Terrorism, air piracy, holding innocent people as hostages, kidnapping and killing diplomats, and other barbarous acts confront us with serious problems. In the past 25 years we in the United Nations have come to realize our common responsibility for the economic and social development of all mankind, but still the poor and the hungry form far too large a part of the world population, We may be grateful on the one hand that we have the United Nations as a common meeting place to discuss world problems, but on the other hand the past 25 years have shown that progress is too slow.
146.	Peace and international security, our primary responsibility under the Charter, have almost constantly been in grave danger and, I might add, still are.
During chis session the Assembly will discuss the subject thoroughly, but let me sound a warning that more than mere words in expected at this time. So long as there is no concrete progress towards international security, my country, for one, feels obliged to spend energy and money for its defenses in order to remain free and independent and to be able to settle its own affairs in its own way. We know that to build adequate defenses by ourselves would tax our resources too highly and we remain therefore convinced of the necessity of a strong alliance with our European, American and Canadian friends.
147.	Building up military defenses, however, is not the only nor the best way to preserve peace and liberty. We in the Netherlands have always been strongly convinced of the necessity to meet each other, to talk over differences and to try to find a common basis for peaceful solutions. This does not mean dissolving existing alliances. It has been demonstrated that our own alliance, NATO, can and does play a most useful role for the promotion of detente in Europe. Our actions are concerted ones; the commitments of one ally are backed by the others and thus gain greater weight.
148.	In this connexion the Netherlands Government welcomes the important understanding reached by the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. I realize that this understanding is only a first step, although an important one. We are now awaiting developments in Berlin which will ease the unhappy situation in this tragically divided city.
149.	The new approach is East-West relations, to which the Secretary-General alluded in the valuable introduction to his annual report [AI8001 /Add. 1 and Corr. 1] and of which I found many proofs in my contacts with many Eastern European colleagues, will, I am confident, be of great value in paving the way to a further relaxation of tension in Europe, possibly leading to a European security conference. In our view, a European security conference is an enterprise of such political significance that it can only be held when success seems reasonably assured. If not, the new developments in East-West relations might well be seriously damaged; therefore, I consider thorough preparation for such a conference a necessary and perhaps essential prerequisite.
150.	But there is more to it. A thorough preparation of all the subjects to be discussed and an assurance of progress is one thing, but the political climate is another. This climate is at present conditioned mainly by three factors. The first one is, as I said a moment ago, a substantial change in the situation in Berlin. For all of us in Western Europe the Berlin Wall is the most abject symbol of the cold war. Changes in the political climate in Berlin and improvements in the access system of the four-Power city are necessary not only for the success of the German-Soviet Treaty, but also for paving the way to a European security conference.
151.	The second factor is progress in the strategic armaments limitation talks, the so-called SALT talks.
Later on I will have something to say about disarmament and arms control in general, but in connexion with the European security conference, I must stress the importance of these American-Soviet negotiations. Their outcome will be of very great importance for the world as a whole, but especially for the European confrontation area.
152.	The third factor is the development of the crisis in the Middle East. It was, I am sure, a great relief to everybody when the fighting in Jordan stopped and when the hostages were freed. Maybe now anew possibility will arise for talks between the Arab States and Israel under the patient guidance of Ambassador Jarring. However, the role of the Soviet Union and the United States of America in promoting peace in the region is as you all will agree truly a paramount one. All of us should refrain from rendering more difficult the present delicate situation. In this respect I earnestly hope that the cease-fire between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors will be prolonged after 5 November next.
153.	The development of the crisis in the Middle East will likewise have its impact on the possibilities of a detente in Europe and on a European security conference. The Middle East is a region whose stability remains of prime importance to Europe.
154.	In enumerating Berlin, SALT and the Middle East as having a great impact on the possibility of convening a European security conference and for the success of the Soviet-German Treaty, I only want to be realistic. I have dwelt at some length on the European political situation and I am confident that the Assembly will not misunderstand the emphasis I have given to these problems. I have been encouraged to do so by a recent remark of our Secretary-General when he stated that, in his view, Europe is the political capital of the world.
155.	Turning now to the problems of arms control and disarmament, I know that the General Assembly will no doubt, as it has done throughout the years, devote considerable attention to these problems. Although the Assembly is still faced with staggering difficulties in this field, I believe there is reason for hope since some real progress has been made during recent years. To a significant extent this was due to the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva. This Conference has proven its value as the central organ for negotiations on matters of arms control and disarmament. For a year now my country has had the opportunity of participating in the deliberations of that body, and we are gratified at the constructive spirit in which its work is generally done.
156.	Speaking of recent progress in the field of arms control, I think in the first place of the conclusion of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] in July 1968 and particularly its entry into force in March of this year, which represents an important landmark in the search for a more secure world. Since then meaningful progress has been made in preparing the ground for the negotiation of safeguards agreements, provided for in the Treaty, in particular through a special safeguards committee advising the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. I am convinced that safeguards arrangements can and will be worked out which will enable IAEA adequately to discharge its responsibility of ensuring in all non- nuclear-weapon countries parties to the non- proliferation Treaty that nuclear material is not diverted for the production of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. It goes without saying that the international safeguards system to be established under the non-proliferation Treaty must be effective and credible.
157.	In order to make the non-proliferation Treaty fully successful, it is vital that all potential nuclear- weapons countries accede to the Treaty. For its part, the Netherlands Government will, wherever possible, promote the ratification of the Treaty by the non- nuclear-weapon countries which are members of EUR ATOM. I have said more than once, and I repeat today, that ultimately the success of the non- proliferation Treaty is 1 iy dependent on the attitude of the present nuclear- .pon Powers. If the vertical proliferation of nuclear arsenals is not curbed, I fear that all arms control will in the long run be frustrated.
158.	In the field of nuclear arms control, I note with gratification the agreement reached within the Confer-ence of the Committee on Disarmament on a draft treaty banning the emplacement of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction on the sea-bed and the ocean floor. 
159.	Without diminishing the urgency of measures of arms control with regard to weapons of mass destruction, I feel bound to voice concern about the dangers arising from the build-up and proliferation of conventional armaments. As the Secretary-General has rightly pointed out, 'the conventional arms race. . . absorbs by far the largest portion of all military expenditure' [A 180011Add. I and Corr.l, para. 20]. That deplorable race is as much a cause as a consequence of political tensions in many parts of the world. Therefore, all competent organ?: of the United Nations should keep this problem constantly in mind. In order to seek effective and non-discriminatory measures to counter the competition and the trade in conventional armaments, it might be useful first to concentrate on the collection of data and on studies of the factual situation.
160.	At the same time, where appropriate, possibilities for regional arrangements could be explored. In this context I may remind the Assembly of the initiative of members of the North Atlantic Alliance calling upon the Warsaw Pact countries to join in the exploration of these possibilities in Europe.
161.	Before concluding my remarks on arms control and disarmament, I should like briefly to go into the matter of chemical and biological warfare, a matter which has received considerable attention at previous
15
sessions of the Assembly. During the present year the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva devoted a major part of its time to this issue. That Committee should certainly be encouraged to continue its study of ways and means to strengthen the existing ban on those methods of warfare.
162.	One of the points of controversy has been the question whether such agents as tear gases and herbicides fall within the scope of the ban on the use of chemical methods of warfare. I do not intend to discuss here the legal aspects of that question,, Instead I want to clarify my Government's position with regard to the desirability of a prohibition of the use in war of those chemical agents. My Government shares the concern that destruction of crops by chemical means for military purposes usually means great suffering for the civilian population. Moreover we are seriously concerned that large-scale use of herbicides and defoliants for military purposes might have ecological long-term effects of an unpredictable nature on man's environment. Therefore we think it necessary to establish a clear rule for the future which would exclude the use of those agents for warlike purposes.
163.	As to tear gases and similar irritants, we recognize that their use in warfare can in certain cases serve humanitarian purposes. However, in the framework of international negotiations the Netherlands Government is ready to take account of a majority opinion in the United Nations: to wit, the use of all biological and chemical agents of warfare including tear gases should be prohibited. My Government will try to promote a consensus along those lines in order to ensure maximum effectiveness of the ban on chemical and biological warfare.
164.	In our general debate there have always been some subjects which do not fit into the general pattern of a speech. They do fit, however, into the general concept of national views and as such they seem important enough to be mentioned before this august Assembly, although they may seem repetitious to those representatives who have listened to my speeches in the last twenty years a modest remark.
165.	The first subject to which the Netherlands Government attaches great importance is the idea of creating the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, originally brought forward by the delegation of Costa Rica at the twentieth session of this Assembly.  My delegation is aware that the progress in the field of standard-setting with regard to universal respect for human rights made in the existing bodies of the United Nations has been important. I feel, however, that when these bodies try to ensure implementation of the formulated standards, their discussions sometimes tend to degenerate into rather vehement debates on a purely political issue. A High Commissioner for Human Rights, on the other hand, would have the advantage of working outside the immediate attention of public opinion, thus being able to avoid political issues while giving quiet advice and assistance, aimed at promoting respect for human rights around the globe.
166.	Because of a combination of factors, the industrialization process in my country has gained great momentum in the last 25 years. Primarily this has been achieved through the unremitting efforts of the Nether-lands working population and partly as a result of the favorable geographical location of my country. A huge concentration of German industries along the Ruhr and Rhine Rivers as a welcome 'hinterland' to my country makes it clear why Holland, and in particular Rotterdam, the greatest harbor in the world, is called the 'gateway of Europe'.
167.	Reaping the benefits of a high level of industrialization, which places my country relatively speaking in a privileged position, has made us realize that the single-minded pursuit of material well-being through a relentless development of our natural and human resources has resulted in a serious disruption of harmonious relations between man and nature. We find ourselves confronted with an air, land and water pollution problem.
168.	May I in this respect refer to the penetrating statement which the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Philippe de Seynes, made last week in the Second Committee of this Assembly [1310th meeting j? I fully agree with Mr. de Seynes that the pollution problem must be seen in its right perspective. Highly industrialized countries, struggling with this problem, tend perhaps to overestimate its impact in the world at large. For the great majority of the world population it is, I may say fortunately, not even a marginal problem, but at the same time this majority of the world population is deprived of the benefits of the technological revolution.
169.	Being fully aware of this reality, there is nevertheless reason for this Organization to cope with pollution. Measures must be taken on an international level to prevent the spread of water and air pollution. My Government, for one, is hopeful that the forthcoming United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  will lead to a comprehensive environmental policy. The Netherlands, as a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Conference, will spare no effort to promote an agreement on reaching those objectives.
170.	By way of change, I wish to refer briefly to a problem that has been solved. The agenda of the twenty-fourth session included the only problem still outstanding between the Netherlands and Indonesia: the question of West Irian. That problem is now solved and therefore no longer appears on the Assembly's agenda. The Netherlands and Indonesia, both free and independent nations, are building up a new relationship I venture to say a new friendship. The state visit of President Suharto of Indonesia was one proof of this most gratifying development.
171.	Among the many subjects remaining on our agenda are one or two I should like to u;fer to briefly.
One is the representation of China. More than 20 years ago, in March 1950, the Netherlands recognized the People's Republic of China. It is therefore logical and understandable that we should like to see the People's Republic take China's seat in the United Nations. We consider that the United Nations is crippled by the absence of the People's Republic of China and that a number of important matters cannot be dealt with satisfactorily in one world organization until this state of affairs is rectified. On the other hand, there is the undeniable fact of the existence of an effective Government exercising authority over more than 12 million people in Taiwan. That Government has for decades made a valuable contribution to the work of the United Nations, and we see no reason why it or any other Government represented here should be summarily expelled from these halls.
172.	Finally, I come to the question of how the United Nations asserts itself in world affairs. In the Netherlands Parliament, and in other public discussions in my country, the question is frequently asked: 'Why does the United Nations not act? How can we strengthen the United Nations?' All of us in this hall are aware that unfortunately the answer cannot be found in amendments to the Charter and that the primary question is how faithfully Members are prepared to conform to the spirit of the Charter. After 25 years, I respectfully submit, words will no longer suffice. It has rightly been said that our Organization is in grave danger of drowning in a sea of words. If the United Nations is to fire the imagination of succeeding generations, as it should, we the Members must change our attitude towards it, and change it now. We are living in disturbing times. Even while this Assembly was in session Violence erupted, international peace and security was endangered broken, even and as a result human blood was shed.
173.	Can it be said with any degree of sincerity that full use has been made of the existing United Nations machinery to prevent or stop those deplorable events, or even to prevent their disastrous recurrence?
174.	Are we, the representatives of the Member States, not too inclined to focus our attention primarily on aptly turned phrases in this magnificent hall instead of acting upon feelings of anguish, shame, anger and grief over lost lives, ruined homes and the inevitable set-back and stagnation in economic and social development? I include myself in that indictment.
175.	These, in the view of the Netherlands delegation, are some of the questions that should be considered at this twenty-fifth session of our Assembly. I am confident that many of my fellow delegates feel as I do, and, although I am well aware that our expectations with regard to the United Nations must always be closely geared to the political realities of the moment, it seems to me important to get a process of political soul-searching started in the hope that it may lead us in due course, and under the indispensable guidance of the Almighty, to a more responsible, more meaningful performance in the United Nations.



"
25,1970,NOR,"113.	 Mr. President, I am happy to congratulate you upon your election to your high office at this twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly. The Norwegian people and its Government share in a feeling of pride at the honor which has been bestowed upon you and we warmly wish you good luck.
114.	We are observing the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. The occasion calls for a few remarks on the unique position occupied by the United Nations, as well on the relations between the Organization and its Members.
115.	The aims and purposes of the United Nations, as set out in the Charter, cover virtually the whole range of man's aspirations. The United Nations is different from other international organizations. It has been given tasks within almost every field of human endeavor, and we have placed upon the Organization the heavy responsibility of safeguarding world-wide peace and security, the fundamental condition for the existence and the survival of the international community.
116.	The United Nations is the most comprehensive vehicle for international collaboration. It is a forum where nations meet regularly without anyone's particular initiative being necessary a forujm where any international problem can be discussed. /It is essential to realize this unique nature of the United Nations, for here lies the key to understanding the potentialities of the Organization as well as its limitations.
117.	The Secretary-General touched on the position of the Organization in a recent speech when he said:
'If there is a crisis today in connexion with the United Nations, it is a crisis of commitment by nation States to the Organization and its purposes. Too many nations still regard the United Nations as peripheral rather than essential to their foreign policy. They tend to evaluate it according to its possible use in advancing their goals rather than as the central instrument for forging solutions to world problems in concert with the rest of the world community.'
118.	The Secretary-General's point of departure is the basic constitutional fact that the United Nations is an organization of sovereign States, and that the authority of the United Nations, and the prospects for the further development of the Organization's capacity for action, are dependent on the willingness of Member States to let the Organization act on their behalf. This is today a realistic view, however much at variance it may be with the popular misconception that the United Nations stands above nations and can act independently of Governments.
119.	It is in that context that the Secretary-General speaks of 'a crisis of commitment'. I am certain that most Governments today feel themselves committed to the United Nations and that in theory they accept the necessity of conferring on the world Organization the authority which is required to carry out the functions with which it is charged. But abstract convictions alone are not sufficient. Governments act on their interpretation of their national interest. We usually are well aware of our immediate and narrowly defined goals. It is not always so easy to discern our long-range interests.
120.	Ours is a rapidly changing world. Political disruptions carry with them ever more frightening threats of total destruction. Scientific and technical discoveries impose new discipline on our every activity, and intellectual and ideological development has led us to a deeply felt concern that all peoples are entitled to share in material progress. In this world, a solution to many of our problems can be found only in joint action by the various nations States through appropriate international organizations. It is our own experience that our true national interests have always depended on the development and improvement of instruments of inter-national co-operation, and in particular of the United Nations. Such development and improvement can, in our view, most effectively be furthered by conferring greater authority on international organs. That, however, would mean that Member States must be willing to relinquish a greater part of their national sovereignty than has been the case in the past.
121.	I am convinced that international society will inevitably have to develop in this direction. We have no means of guessing how rapidly such changes will take place. But we may be fairly certain that they will come about gradually and by small, careful steps. Postwar history has shown us that such developments are likely to progress more quickly in international organizations that are limited functionally and regionally. This poses no contradiction to our ideals of a general and universal organization. Indeed, my country has applied for membership in the European communities in the belief that closer relations between the nations of Europe will also make important contributions to the United Nations in political terms, as well as with regard to the ability of the world Organization to deal effectively with the problems of international economic development.
122.	But in our long-range view on future international organization, we must never lose sight of the urgent realities of the present. It is the overriding purpose of the United Nations to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security. Yet we meet today in bitter realization of the fact that violent conflicts still prevail in many parts of the world. A few weeks ago we were encouraged by the restoration of the ceasefire in the Middle East and by the prospect that fruitful discussions might come about concerning the enduring problems of that area. Despite recent disappointing developments, it is still my hope that all parties will enter into the discussions for which the stage was set during careful preparations by interested Powers.
123.	In this situation, it is imperative to avoid acts which might jeopardize developments towards a peaceful settlement. We are therefore disturbed by the recent manifestations of new forms of organized violence emanating from that area. Groups, acting independently of States, have perpetrated politically motivated attacks against civilian aircraft of many nations. These attacks on civil aviation threaten the lives of innocent civilian passengers in a manner which would be illegal among soldiers in open warfare. We are threatened with serious disruptions of international air transport which may mean grave economic setbacks for many countries and also a setback to civilized society. Continued attacks against civilian airlines are intolerable wherever they occur and whatever their motivation, and they must be brought to an end. We have already started to deal with the problem in the United Nations and in other relevant organizations too, and we must pursue our efforts with still greater energy.
124.	We find the most dramatic threats to international security in the areas of acute conflict. But let us not for a moment believe that latent disputes pose less serious threats to the international community. It is therefore encouraging to note that the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany have recently agreed on the mutual renunciation of the use of force. The signing of the treaty between the two countries represents an important contribution to future detente in Europe. Other important diplomatic developments either have already been launched or are in active preparation. In time, and with luck, these developments may create conditions for improved relations between all European States.
125.	The risk of nuclear warfare remains a matter of serious concern to the world community. Nevertheless, we have noted with satisfaction that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has presented a draft treaty on the prohibition of the emplacement of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction on the sea-bed and the ocean floor and in the subsoil thereof.  In another forum the two-Power talks on the limitation of strategic armaments are being continued.
126.	But the question of international security has a wider range than purely political considerations. When we talk of peace we must never forget the basic conditions that breed conflict and lead men and nations to war. The world must offer everyone a decent standard of living in the widest sense of the word: material, social, medical, cultural. The world must ensure respect for fundamental human rights and man must protect his own environment. In every one of these fields, the United Nations is faced by demands and challenges. The organization must respond and Member States must shoulder the burdens which will be placed on them in this respect.
127.	During the Second United Nations Development Decade we must make a serious effort to work out a comprehensive time-table for action and commitment for development based on the idea of concerted worldwide activities. However, the development problems of the third world cannot be solved merely by drafting a strategy for development. All nations developing as well as developed must be prepared to undertake the political and financial commitments inherent in the development strategy. Norway, for its part, is prepared to do so. The Norwegian Parliament has recently approved a plan whereby the total flow of Norwegian financial resources to international development will be accelerated and reach 1 per cent of our gross national 
product in 1974. Furthermore, my Government intends to propose gradually increased appropriations for official development assistance so as to reach a level of at least 0.75 per cent of our gross national product in 1974.
128.	The work of the United Nations in advancing the ideals of human rights over the past twenty-five years represents yet another way of dealing with the shortcomings of human society. We have undoubtedly made notable progress but much remains to be done. We have translated our ideals into texts and given adequate definition to our legal concepts. We have reached the stage where implementation of almost universally accepted human rights and fundamental freedoms has become the crucial issue. Under the two Covenants on Human Rights, we have established for the first time under the United Nations a conventional machinery resting on legally binding international treaties. The Economic and Social Council has accepted a proposal for improved procedures for dealing with complaints of gross violations of human rights within the Commission on Human Rights. There is a proposal before the Assembly to establish a post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. We fully support that proposal and we feel that the Commissioner should be given a mandate which would enable him to deal with all sorts of viola-tions of human rights in every part of the world. At the stage where we are concentrating our efforts on the implementation of human rights, we should be aware of the dangers of inconsistency in the application of the international standards we have agreed upon. All the provisions of the international instruments must be applied justly, without discrimination and without attempts at politically motivated exploitation. We cannot expect any Government to accept the advice or the criticism of an international body if that body is not scrupulously fair and consistent.
129.	The protection of human rights may require an adjustment of traditional concepts of the relationship between the United Nations and its member States, and an expansion of the competence of organizations in fields hitherto exclusively reserved to national authority.
130.	The need for new thinking in this field has already been demonstrated in situations where the international community has been unable to bring relief in sufficient quantities and with the required dispatch to civilian victims of natural and other disasters. As will be known, my Government has repeatedly urged an examination of the ways and means by which the United Nations could play a greater and more effective part in future disaster situations of that kind.
131.	Similarly, the problems connected with the protection of the human environment do not appear to lend themselves to a rational solution exclusively by national means. The problems are universal. Cause and effect are not confined within a single nation, or even larger geographical regions. Nor do those problems concern the industrialized countries alone. The United Nations has already made a start in coordinating the views of Member Nations, and we look to the Stockholm conference in 1972  with hopes that the gravity of the problems, and the pressing needs to do something about them, will be brought forcibly home to world public opinion and to Governments.
132.	The exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed and ocean floor is another field where new realities require us to abandon traditional concepts. The seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction forms a part of the common heritage of mankind. Basic rules are urgently needed for the exploration, conservation and peaceful exploitation of the potential riches of this area for the benefit of all peoples. It is a source of disappointment to my Government that the Committee has not reached agreement on a declaration of principles governing the activities of States in this field. My Government regards the adoption of a set of principles as an important first step towards effective international regulation of the sea-bed and ocean floor, and would sincerely hope that the General Assembly will be able to make progress towards agreement on such principles during the present session.
133.	Any exposition of a country's total policies with regard to the United Nations within the framework of this general debate must, of necessity, be fragmentary. But I need not assure you, Mr. President, that the Norwegian people are sincere in their devotion to the ideals of the United Nations and that we are earnest in bur desire to seek a constant development and strengthening of the Organization. If we can achieve some progress at this anniversary session of the Assembly, if we succeed in strengthening confidence in our Organization, then this measure of success will reflect honor on the United Nations.
"
25,1970,PRY,"226.	  Before I begin my statement in the general debate and with the consent of the President, I should like to state from this rostrum the deep and sincere feeling of solidarity with which the people and the Government of the Republic of Paraguay as well as members of my delegation associate themselves with the sorrow of the Government and people of the United Arab Republic on the premature death of their President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, an eminent leader of worldwide stature, to whose memory we seriously and respectfully bow.
227.	On coming to this rostrum I shall first discharge an express mission, which is as honored as it is pleasant, entrusted to me by my Government. On its behalf I extend to Ambassador Hambro its warmest congratulations on his election to preside over this session of the General Assembly, during which the United Nations Organization will commemorate its twenty- fifth anniversary. My Government sees in Mr. Hambro's election both a tribute to Norway because of its eminent and constant contribution to the cause of peace, and a tribute to Ambassador Hambro's lofty personal qualities, which have justly won for him our respect, admiration and confidence. As the representative of my Government I present to his predecessor, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph, a tribute of sincere appreciation for the outstanding work she did during the previous General Assembly.
228.	It has been a rule of my delegation to participate in the general debate at each session of the General Assembly so as to state from this rostrum its views regarding the principal problems submitted to it for consideration and on the most important items in the agendas.
229.	But, in this anniversary year, which marks a quarter of a century of existence for the United Nations, we wish to depart from this rule and present in a tightly-knit synthesis a recapitulation of some of the ideas connected with the past, the present and the future of our Organization, which have already been expressed by my delegation at previous meetings.
230.	Being fully aware that no cooperation in the application of the principles and the attainment of the purposes of the United Nations is more complete or more noble than that which can be offered by Member States through their compliance and respect both in their domestic and international conduct, we wish to present the credentials which authorize me to speak from this rostrum with objectivity and independence of views.
231.	My country is one which belongs to the numerous group of the 'developing countries', as they are called, whose economy is essentially agricultural and of livestock and whose industrialization is still in its beginning. Furthermore, it is one of the only two countries which in Latin America see that, over and above the problems inherent in development without sufficient financing, we furthermore face problems which result from being landlocked. As such, we have fought and will continue to fight with steadfast determination to win acceptance for ever more advanced principles of international law which will compensate for the disadvantages derived from our being situated at a considerable distance from the sea. In this connexion, an eminent jurist from Afghanistan said that the problems of international trade of landlocked countries are enormous and that this condition does not disappear, even though the problems may change from time to time and from region to region.
232.	I mention this circumstance simply to give you a clearer idea of the magnitude of the problems which Paraguay must overcome and vanquish in its tenacious and uninterrupted effort under a dynamic and patriotic Government, to consolidate our economic infrastructure and to raise to ever higher levels.
233.	On the international level our conduct is such that we can proclaim, without either boasting or false modesty, that our country has not created situations nor been involved in conflicts that required the attention of the General Assembly at any time. That does not mean that we have no problems of this kind, or that we have not had them, but that, in conformity with our own tradition and with the mandates of the Charter, we have sought and still seek adequate solutions by way of direct negotiations.
234.	Internally, we have carried out a vast task of consolidating the economic infrastructure, of constantly raising the standard of living of our population; of improvement of our democratic institutions; of maintaining the value of our currency, despite the tremendous sacrifices this implies; and, above all and foremost, we have managed to strengthen an order of peace based on justice, in which democratic political parties are free to play an active part, and are now preparing to participate in general municipal elections called for 25 October. The index of attendance at schools, as well as that of nutrition, are among the highest in Latin America. Progress, in a few words, is continuous and integral, and the results obtained are the best rewards won by the statesman who presides over our national destiny. This is the country which I represent in this Assembly and whose voice I bring to you.
235.	Perhaps as never before, this general debate has given us an opportunity to know with greater accuracy the points of view of Member States regarding the undoubted successes of the United Nations during its twenty-five years of existence; regarding the failures which, even though with pain and in spite of sincere efforts, we must recognize, and the frustrations which more than once have tended to weaken our will. But, above all, this debate is in a way unique, because the criticisms of the shortcomings of the Organization, brought to light during its life span, have been set forth with loftiness of purpose and, we believe, with a constructive intent.
236.	But it would be tantamount to self-deceit and to deceiving the peoples whom we represent if these criticisms, addressed to the United Nations as a whole, were not accompanied by a capacity for as objective an examination as possible, which each Member must undertake, of the value and scope of his own national effort to give the provisions contained in the Charter universal content and validity.
237.	As long as this capacity for criticism and self criticism exists we can have faith in the future of our Organization, in its role, and expect that its actions will move forward a time of wellbeing, of dignity, a time of value and happiness for the human being, whatever his nationality, race, sex, creed, language, the place where he was born, or the land he inhabits.
238.	Some of the criticisms have perhaps been very severe. It is conceivable that with the creation of the United Nations, the world, which had just emerged from an extremely cruel, bloody, and devastating war, placed in the Organization an overdose of optimism about the possibilities open to it, giving it a prematurely illusory content.
239.	The frustrations resulting from the contrast between illusions and reality and from observing the growing political and economic power held by a few States, which are too powerful in comparison with the vast majority of those which make up this Assembly, have probably been some of the determining causes of a situation which, particularly in recent years, has become accentuated and is certainly a cause for deep concern. This situation consists in the tendency to remove from United Nations jurisdiction some of the gravest international problems which should, because of their very nature, have a natural forum in this Assembly. Instead of bringing those problems to a frank and open debate in this universal forum, they have been taken to the restricted forums of the conference tables of a few States which are, of course, the strongest within the community of nations. We cannot accuse the most powerful countries which hold the political, military and economic power I have referred to, of being solely responsible. We must also recognize our share of responsibility. We have increasingly attributed to them greater responsibilities, thus adding to the power which they already have, the power of representation, which is nothing but a disguised form of a renunciation of what should be our unavoidable duties.
240.	Hence, the time has come to reaffirm the need to make maximum use of the possibilities of this lofty forum. It is time to bring or bring back to it the problems which are its responsibility and not remove them. And when these problems refer to the breach or the possibility of a breach of peace and international security, the obligation is even more absolute. If any attitude can be dangerously negative, if any conduct can contribute to a greater degree to the ineffectiveness of the United Nations and eventually to its decline, it would be to remove from the Organization the examination of the problems I am referring to.
241.	Of course, we must expect that debates of such problems will bring to light deep differences of views in the application of the principles and the attainment of the purposes of the Organization criteria which not only will be different but will even be opposite. None of this should discourage us. Perhaps we should be less concerned with the quest for constant unanimity, since uniformity of thinking is not a usual condition among men who come from and represent different continents, States, races, cultures and civilizations, and accordingly respond to different historical, political and economic interests. In the contrast of criteria is the indispensable element to give strength and vigor to our Organization.
242.	In making those comments I do not intend to attempt to pronounce judgment on the results achieved by the United Nations during twenty-five years of existence. But I would be failing in an unavoidable duty were I not to formulate the categorical and unequivocal affirmation that in our view the postulates, the principles and the purposes of the United Nations, incorporated in the Charter which was signed at San Francisco, are at present as valid as they were then, that in themselves they point to the goal we shall some day reach and that today, like yesterday, they define the standards for domestic and international conduct, whose universal scrupulous and loyal observance is, and will continue to be, the best guarantee for the maintenance of peace and security in justice, for the establishment at the world level of the rule of that justice, to regulate relations among States in an order in which each one enjoys full sovereign equality, and to promote social progress and the economic wellbeing of man within an atmosphere of greater freedom.
243.	Our differences in many cases are due to our diverse criteria regarding the procedures which are adequate to win universal acceptance of such principles, and for the likewise universal attainment of these purposes. These differences are due also to varying assessments of the effectiveness of the organ to which the Charter attributes the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, namely the Security Council. The political conception of what the postwar world would be, seen from the perspective of 1945, determined the structure of that Council and the role of fundamental importance assigned to its permanent members. These had emerged victorious after a long and hard bloody war, waged in solidarity, against the forces of aggression and barbarism. That conception of the postwar world, nevertheless, is not fitting for a different era. Since then we have seen the decline of great colonial empires. On the world stage we have seen the emergence of superPowers endowed with a military, economic and technological might as yet unknown on earth, On the other hand, a result of the growing application of the principle of right of peoples to self-determination in the process of decolonization which, nevertheless and regrettably, has still not been completed, most representatives who attend this Assembly represent States which barely twenty-five years ago were subject to the colonial yoke and are today masters of their own sovereign destinies. No, the world of 1945 is not that of 1970. 
244.	In San Francisco it was expected that, in cases of a breach or threat of a breach of international peace, the permanent members could take joint and harmonious action to preserve peace. The expectation faded, time has seen to it, and the result has been, in many cases, the inability or powerlessness of the Security Council to take effective action; inability or powerlessness which is all the more to be deplored since the action which we expected from that organ was both indispensable and urgent.
245.	Faced with that situation and its possible consequences for the effectiveness of the fundamental mission which devolves on the United Nations which led to its creation we can expect a growing role for the other Members of the Organization, particularly for those which represent the less endowed areas of the world Africa, Asia and Latin America. But let us not forge for ourselves the vain illusion that because of our number we constitute an influential force, yet nor would we wish to underrate the value of our numerical majority, a numerical majority and a value which would subsist to the extent that we found a formula for joint action, based on our own common interests. This quest is something far greater than a right. It is an obligation to exert our best efforts to that end and with that purpose.
246.	Referring to the area from which I come, Latin America, I must specifically mention the important and far-reaching role in the preservation of peace and international security which our regional Organization plays, an organization which combines the achievements which honor its existence with the vast capital of its contributions in the field of international law.
247.	Now, I believe it is my duty to reiterate once more the concepts stated in past sessions of the Assembly by the head of my delegation and Minister for Foreign Affairs. If States are to act within the international community as individuals do within national communities, logic indicates that the peaceful coexistence of countries of such varied origins and disciplines, with such different ideological, political and economic criteria and at such unequal stages of development, can only be secured with the three traditional basic elements: international law or the set of internationally accepted principles loyally observed; international tribunals or organizations for the administration of justice; and international forces able, when needed, to forestall situations which violate accepted 'laws and to apply international sanctions.
248.	The United Nations has done considerable work in the field of establishing international laws, because of the many conventions adopted under its auspices, but we must recognize that the road ahead is a long one. As regards organizations able to administer justice at the international level, we note with concern and sorrow the declining role of the International Court of Justice. We believe that acceptance of international justice and compliance with the decisions of competent organs is no offense to the sovereignty of States. On the contrary, it is typical of eras of regression and barbarism that, in the event of conflict between States, the strong try to prevail over the weak by their own means, for their own benefit, disregarding all concepts of right and justice.
249.	As for the existence of international forces provided for in the Charter, the possibility is still remote. Years ago, in his introduction to his annual report on the work of the Organization, presented to the General Assembly at its nineteenth session,  the SecretaryGeneral referred to offers of military units as reserve forces made to the United Nations by several Member States, that is, forces available to the Organization whenever a justified need for them arose. The SecretaryGeneral then added that he had not been able to do much because no competent United Nations organ had adopted any measure authorizing him to accept the offer, even though no expenditure for the
Organization was involved until a contingent actually began to serve the Organization. Six years later, the situation is still the same. Furthermore, it is known that there has been no solution to a problem indissolubly linked to the possibility of having those forces, or others, intended for peacekeeping. I am referring to the adoption of equitable systems to finance peacekeeping operations. We know the magnitude of the efforts made in the relevant committee, under the leadership of an eminent Latin American, to find mutually acceptable formulas. In recording the fact that they have not yet been found, we trust that the months to come will prove to be more fruitful.
250.	The above comments and, particularly, some made during this general debate, would seem to indicate a desire to revise the Charter. We frankly admit that we do not believe that the time is propitious to undertake such a task. At the same time we believe that for a real and effective evaluation of the predominant trend of thought among Members of the United Nations, the General Assembly already has the appropriate instrument in item 88, entitled 'Need to consider suggestions regarding the review of the Charter of the United Nations'. Let us avail ourselves of that instrument.
251.	I have devoted most of my statement to questions related to international peace and security. Implicit in these comments is the hope for general and complete disarmament, under adequate international control. If I have not made special reference to matters pertaining to disarmament, it is because the item is on the agenda of the First Committee, where there will be ample opportunity for an exhaustive examination. For the time being, I should like to voice the deep concern with which we observe the monstrous amount of resources invested in armaments, an amount which is all the more overwhelming when it is compared with the figures to which the solidarity of the developed world is reduced, as its contribution to the economic and social development of most of the human race.
252.	Peace is the cornerstone on which order among nations and collective security rest, because they are indissolubly linked with other problems, and it is the latter that affect us from day to day. This is so for those of us who constitute the countries called developing, in our unceasing efforts to overcome the obstacles to our economic and social development, to correct a system of international trade which is not only unjust but immoral, to obtain the equitable distribution of our riches and the fruits of our work and to raise the standard of living of our peoples, many of whom, in this second half of the twentieth century, are still struggling in the infamy of backwardness and the degradation of poverty.
253.	Every day that goes by without demolishing the artificial barriers which separate those who have too much from those who have too little, barriers dividing those who enjoy highly satisfactory remuneration as compensation for their efforts from those who must be satisfied with the wages of a pauper, means new and increasing suffering for those large masses of man 
kind. In that difference, the magnitude of which can only be measured in unspeakable anguish is rooted the greatest of the potential conflicts which it is possible to imagine, and, should it ever break out, would spare no continent, no country, no human community.
254.	The time for finding adequate solutions to this contemporary drama is running short, particularly in this Second Development Decade. The hour is late, but not irrevocably so. Therefore let us renew our efforts and our hope, in the expectation of better days. I conclude my statement with a quotation from the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brazil: ' 'We must not forget that the United Nations represents the only specialized agency we have for peace, development and collective security' [1841st meeting, para. 15].
255.	On our capacity for collective action, on our sincerity of purpose and on the intensity of our efforts, will depend whether we convert into fruitful reality the theme of this twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations: peace, justice and progress for all the peoples of the world.
"
25,1970,DZA,"1.  The delegation of Algeria is very pleased to see the Twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly held under the presidency of a person who has rendered great services to the international community and who deserves the great esteem in which all his colleagues hold him. I should like to stress the fact that you, Sir, represent a friendly country which, In this international forum, has shown sympathy and support for the struggle of the Algerian people to achieve independence.
2.	During the course of our reflections throughout these last few days, since the death of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, we remembered that on 27 September 1960 [873rd meeting] 10 years prior to the death of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, almost to the very hour, our General Assembly had the opportunity to hear a speech made by our brother, the President of the United Arab Republic. The Algerian delegation requested a few moments ago that the Secretary General be kind enough to accede to our request and to circulate to all members the full text of that speech delivered by President Gamal Abdel Nasser. I will confine myself to quoting a few extracts from that historic speech. These few extracts which I quote will emphasize the determination of our President, as expressed in Cairo, and proclaimed also by our delegation here, never to forget the teachings left by President Nasser.
3.	Exactly ten years before his death, President Nasser stated here:
'There is no problem which concerns our homeland, the United Arab Republic, or which concerns our nation, the Arab nation, or which relates to the two continents, Asia and Africa, through which the
frontiers of our country extend, or which relates to any of the world problems   I say that there is no such problem for whose solution we are not ready to accept the Charter of the United Nations and its principles, the resolutions of the United Nations and its recommendations for a just settlement, with the best of goodwill.' [Ibid., para. 119.]
4.	President Nasser added:
'Four years ago the African continent witnessed the end of one era of colonialism, and today it is witnessing a new form of imperialism. The aggression on Suez was the end of unmasked imperialism and its graveyard. Today we find the Congo presenting us with masked imperialism, which does not shrink from exploiting the United Nations itself in order to realize its hidden designs and aims. The real meaning of Suez to liberation movements in Asia and Africa was that an era had gone forever, an era in which imperialist forces were able to possess and mobilize armies and launch fleets to strike deadly blows at the liberation movements. The Suez war has proved that the victim of aggression has its own armies and that freedom has its supporters everywhere in the world.' [Ibid., para. 120.]
A/PV.1859
5.	President Nasser continued:
'In our part of the world, the Arab East, the United Nations has forgotten its Charter and disregarded its responsibilities towards the rights of the people of Palestine,
'Have the days and the years led to a solution of the problem? Have the people of Palestine forgotten all about their country, their land and their homes? Did the Arab nation forget the tragedy of the Arab people of Palestine, against whom imperialism conspired   with a mandate from the League of Nations   taking upon itself to promise to certain groups a country belonging to another people? Since when have the motherlands of peoples been the property of the imperialist, to dispose of arbitrarily and to give to others?
'Imperialism has its own logic. The logic of imperialism, as manifested in its crime against the people of Palestine, has been to break the geographical unity of the Arab world, on the one hand, and, on the other, to create for itself in the very heart of the Arab world a base from which to threaten the Arab peoples. I believe no stronger proof of this could be given than the conspiracy which led to the tripartite aggression against us in 1956.
'Have the peoples of the Arab nation accepted the geographic division imposed on them by imperialism?
'A phenomenon worthy of reflection is that the drive of Arab unity has extracted its great power from this aggression; in fact, we find that in its footsteps came the birth of the United Arab Republic.
'Have the people of Palestine accepted the loss of their motherland? Did the Arab nation accept that loss? It is certain that the determination of the Arab peoples to restore the Arab rights in Palestine has since this aggression become one of the major driving forces in the Arab East.' [Ibid., paras. 129134.]
6. In this hall we heard President Gamal Abdel Nasser declare:
'You all know that the United Arab Republic believes in the policy of nonalignment and adheres to it as a strict yardstick. I hardly need to repeat the story of the sacrifices made by our Arab nation to hold to the policy of nonalignment, animated by our conviction that it ensures its independence on the one hand, and is conducive to the preservation of lasting peace on the other.
'In spite of all pressure, we refuse to become tools in the cold war. We also spared no efforts to explain underlying principles of that policy, namely, that peace cannot prevail while the world is divided up into antagonistic parts or blocs with no link between them but trenches and barbed wire behind which lie the weapons of aggression and the arms of death and destruction. This policy is based on the belief that peace prevails only when there is more understanding among peoples and when fruitful contacts and creative interrelationship exist on the largest scale possible. The Bandung Conference of AfricanAsian peoples is one of the greatest landmarks on the road of our national struggle in defense of our principles.' /Ibid., paras. 154 and J55.]
1. A few moments later, our lamented brother, Gamal Abdel Nasser, added:
'I hereby declare before you, in the name of the United Arab Republic and in expression of its thoughts and conscience, that we believe that the problem of peace and war should be shared by all peoples inasmuch as it determines their future and destiny. The big Powers do not alone have the right to speak about peace and war; it is mankind as a whole that has the final word, having obtained this right through the sacrifices of its different peoples for the sake of civilization and the promotion of its development, and its long yearning for security.
'Thus, when peace is at stake, we do take sides; ours is the side of peace. If we have any qualifications to attach to this definite position against war, it is that the peace we aspire to is that based on justice without discrimination.
8.	President Abdel Gamal Nasser continued his speech in these terms:
'There remains then the problem of the great drive towards freedom, particularly economic independence. We see, and you can see with us, those free and glorious drives going on in Africa, in Asia and in Latin America.
' 'We have but to observe this encouraging increase in the number of States Members of the United Nations. While only forty-eight nations participated in the first session of the General Assembly, we find almost a hundred nations represented here today. We do not doubt, as we see the remnants of imperialism retreating everywhere before the march of the peoples looking forward to liberty, that the scope of the United Nations will increase and strengthen and that the next few years will bring with them new flags representing new victories in the sphere of political freedom. We can, however, observe from now that this great expected development will not completely solve the problem of the drive for freedom; we might even say that, if the matter is not dealt with in a spirit of conscious appreciation, the problem of the drive for freedom will grow in dimension as a result of the struggle behind it and of the pull and clash of forces latent in it.
'Those peoples who have obtained their political freedom or who expect to gain it in the near future look forward to economic independence and are preparing to fight for it. These newly independent nations are firmly convinced that, if they do not obtain their economic independence, they will not find the sound basis upon which they can preserve their political freedom. Much of what goes on in Africa, Asia and Latin America today   the acute aspects of which may astonish many of us here   constitutes in fact some features of that drive towards economic liberation. The newly independent peoples are convinced that true freedom lies in reaching a higher standard of living for their sons. The newly independent peoples   and this I must state here frankly   are hastening their steps along the road to economic development, and they feel that they cannot afford to waste any time after a long period of lagging behind.' [ Ibid., paras. 173175.]
9.	In that declaration that we, Algerians, who were on the threshold of the United Nations, heard in this hall, he continued:
'We believe also that the supremacy of the United Nations means the supremacy of principles and the triumph of law and justice over the dreams of conquest and domination. We believe that the spirit of peace based on justice provides the most favorable atmosphere for our country to promote its development and for paving the way for the fulfillment of its hopes for rebuilding our society on a new basis. You all know that a national revolutionary current sweeps our country today; or, in fact, our country, the United Arab Republic, is living three revolutions running side by side.
'First, a political revolution made itself felt in resisting imperialism in its various stages, from the time it was overt in the shape of occupying forces till the days when it hid itself behind military pacts, in which we saw nothing but an attempt at subjugating us to the policy of zones of influence.
'Second, a social revolution manifests itself in resisting feudalism and monopoly. In its devoted task for increased production with a view to raising the standard of living and affording equal opportunities to all citizens   in compliance with the implementation of which a ten-year plan to double the national income has started in both regions of the United Arab Republic   this revolution is but an aspect of the unwavering effort and the determination of our people to build their country.
'Third, an Arab revolution found expression in resisting artificial dissension and the material and moral obstacles set up by those who tried to rule our country by the wellknown Machiavellian method of 'divide and rule'. We declare that we believe in the unity of our nation. The Arab nation was always characterized by the unity of language, and the unity of language is the unity of thought. The Arab nation was always characterized by the unity of history, and the unity of history is the unity of conscience. We cannot find another basis of nationalism stronger and more stable than this. It is not by pure hazard that the Arab nations which obtained their independence stipulated in the post independence constitution that their 'people are part of the Arab nation'. Moreover, it is not merely an emotional reaction that the Arab peoples sincerely believe that any aggression against one of them is an aggression against them all; and that there was no trial that faced the Arab nation without its becoming one strong front to meet it. The birth of the United Arab Republic is the biggest symbol of the faith of the Arab peoples in Arab nationalism and in Arab unity.
'We believe that conscious development which is based on the call for peace and which relies on setting examples through creative and positive work is our path to this unity, in which we have faith.' [Ibid., paras. 184  188.]
10.	Algeria will participate in the Twenty-fifth anniversary session of our Organization and will do its share of the task of taking stock of the work of the last quarter of a century and our responsibilities in one of the most critical and dangerous international situations and will also make an effort to help restore to the United Nations its true dimensions and its moral authority. Therefore this statement will be limited to a few most important and fundamental points of great timeliness.
11.	Algeria in the last general debate [1784th meeting] stressed that the world was facing the problem of attempts at world hegemony, which find their murderous and brutal expression in the least developed continents, where imperialism   and United States imperialism in particular   is attacking peoples, revolutionary movements and ideologies of liberation.
The developing countries are the objects of imperialist covetousness, and it is their children that fall under the guns of the aggressors, who are the same in VietNam, Palestine, Africa and Latin America.
12.	The independence of the peoples, their economic development and their social progress automatically challenge imperialist, colonialist and neo-colonialist interests. It is in order to preserve these threatened interests that imperialism is stepping up this aggression against the peoples, the national liberation movements and progressive societies. The awakening of conscience with regard to this threat which looms over the developing countries and certain agreements between great Powers have provoked the birth and strengthening of nonalignment and explain the success of the Lusaka summit.  
13.	We should of course record a relaxation of tension between the great Powers and the progress made in the search for solutions to European problems, but we are forced to note that this relaxation of tension between great Powers, between developed countries, is of benefit to the imperialists who are engaged in wars of extermination in IndoChina, the Middle East and Africa.
14.	Peaceful coexistence in its present conception has not put an end to the arms race, has not caused an evolution in the developed countries with regard to their economic relations with the developing countries and has not put an end to imperialist aggression and exploitation. This concept of peaceful coexistence assures the great Powers peace and permits war to be waged against the small countries.
15.	The best way to bring about peace is to fight those that threaten it, that is to say, the aggressors. It is by creating a united front of the peoples against all forms of hegemony, against domination, against exploitation of any kind, that we shall succeed in creating conditions of true peace r d true security which will make it possible to have free economic development and social progress. This struggle is being waged by the peoples of Palestine and VietNam and has been waged for more than 20 years. This struggle is also the struggle of the peoples of South Africa, Rhodesia, Namibia, Guinea (Bissau), Angola and Mozambique. Algeria is unreservedly behind those peoples. We shall continue to provide them with our moral and material support. It is by strengthening the national liberation movement struggle throughout the world that we shall really be working for peace, justice and international security.
16.	The Palestinian people has taken its destiny into its own hands. More than 20 years of joint acts of aggression on the part of the imperialistZionist forces have not succeeded in eliminating the Palestine national fact, which is the dominating factor in the Middle East situation. This people exists and fights, but our Organization continues to ignore its existence and its fight.
It is today in the vanguard of the liberation struggles, and that is why imperialism has unleashed all its forces and strength against it. The initiators of what is known as the Rogers plan had as their principal object the elimination of Palestinian resistance. AmericanZionist imperialism has found in Jordan reactionary forces to carry out a dirty criminal task, the massacre of tens of thousands of Palestinians, old men, women and children. These massacres have been perpetrated under the cover of the military umbrellas of Washington and Tel Aviv and with considerable logistic support from the United States. Never has the cooperation and coordination of the imperialists, Zionists and Arab reactionaries been so clearcut and so flagrant as during the recent bloody events in Jordan.
17.	The Algerian revolution, faithful to its principles and its fundamental policies, has ceaselessly been behind all causes for liberty throughout the world. It unconditionally backs the Palestinian people and indeed supports all the Arab peoples struggling against the Zionist aggressor and occupier.
18.	The problem of the elimination of the consequences of the Israeli aggression of June 1967 is closely connected that of the restoration to the Palestinian people of its legitimate rights, principally its right to self-determination and territorial integrity.
19.	The United States interventionism in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean began with the installation in Palestine by force and terror of a European settler colony, constituting a base at the crossroads of three continents, with the object of controlling the natural resources of the region and fighting the Arab peoples' emancipation movement. Israel and the Sixth Fleet have an identical mission: that of subjugating, dominating and exploiting the Arab peoples.
20.	The Zionist-imperialist threat and its alliance with the Arab reactionaries in Jordan have strengthened the unity of the Arab nation, strengthened its will to fight and developed its capacity to resist.
21.	In VietNam the United States aggressors and their lackeys continue to be thwarted by the brave VietNamese people. The extension of the United States aggression to Cambodia has only served to strengthen the united front of the peoples of IndoChina. Algeria is behind these peoples and has recognized the Government of National Union presided over by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and considers that Government as the only representative of the Khmer people.
22.	The fighting nature of the VietNamese people has brought the aggressor to the negotiating table, but the interminable talks in Paris only bring into relief the lack of good faith on the part of the United States aggressors. The Foreign Minister of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South VietNam, Mrs. Nguyen Thi Binh, on 17 September last submitted an 'initiative with a view to bringing about progress at the Paris Conference'. That program of eight points is a serious, tangible and realistic contribution towards a peaceful solution of the South VietNam problem.
23.	The refusal of the United States Government to consider the recent proposals of the representatives of South VietNam demonstrates that the imperialists have not given up their policy of aggression against peoples. But the VietNamese people and all the people of IndoChina have sufficient strength to throw back the aggressor and impose peace, independence and unity in that part of the world.
24.	Also in Asia, the Korean people remains unanimous in its will for independence, territorial unity and progress. It carries the banner of the right of peoples to self-determination, social progress and economic development. We must help that people in its struggle and demand withdrawal of the foreign troops from Korean territory United States troops under the United Nations flag.
25.	Africa continues to be, through its natural resources and its enormous economic potential, a choice target for imperialism, colonialism and neocolonialism and the most hideous expression of those policies, racism and apartheid.
26.	The fact that certain great Powers continue to provide arms to the colonialists and racists and to develop their economic relations with them   in spite of the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly will change nothing in the course of African history. This history is being forged by the hands of the freedom fighters and of the national liberation movements. The peoples subjected to colonialism and the victims of racism have taken up arms; and the gun is the dignity of today and the freedom of tomorrow.
27.	The question of the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is one of those which will be decisive for the future of our Organization.
28.	Since our admission to the United Nations we have ceaselessly denounced the discriminatory, hostile and provocative policy pursued by certain governments towards the Chinese people and its legitimate Government. That policy has as its main objective an attempt to isolate the greatest nation in the world, a nation with tremendous revolutionary successes to its credit and one whose economic, political and social potential constitutes an essential contribution in the struggle of the peoples against imperialism, colonialism and neocolonialism.
29.	This policy of quarantining the Chinese people and its legitimate Government has completely failed. The fraternal relations which exist between the People's Republic of China and the national liberation movements in Africa, Asia and Latin America are an example of solidarity in the common struggle. The diplomatic, economic and cultural relations of the People's Republic of China with an ever-growing number of States also constitute proof that the policy of quarantine has not succeeded.The growing influence in the world of revolutionary thought which inspires the Chinese people demonstrates the illusory, naive and futile nature of the policy of Governments which believe they can isolate the Chinese revolution and finally stifle it.
30.	What we have just said shows that it would be ridiculous to think that the Chinese people needs the United Nations to make progress in its struggle. Quite the contrary, it is the United Nations which needs the presence of the People's Republic of China if it wishes to survive. To survive, the Organization must bring its acts in to line with the principles enshrined in the Charter and it must reflect the international realities.
31.	The Preparatory Committee for the Second United Nations Development Decade set up by the General Assembly two years ago is on the point of concluding its work, and we must pay a tribute to it for the considerable work that it has done. Nevertheless, we cannot conceal the fact that the international agreement which has been brought about regarding development strategy is far from responding to the expectations of the less privileged nations and peoples. The slow pace of the achievements of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in implementing agreements relating to primary commodities, the need for the reorganization of international trade and the proper proportion to be allotted to the developing countries within the framework of the creation of new liquidity, only serves to stress most acutely the inadequacies of the commitments of the more developed countries.
32.	Algeria is resolutely devoted to a policy of development based principally upon its own resources and means, the preservation of its economic independence in harmony with its neighbors in the Magreb and Africa, and the development of economic and technical cooperation. Our economic plan expressed in our FourYear Plan is under way and falls within the framework of the development strategy defined by the Algiers Charter which emanated from the Conference of the seventy-seven  and the Lusaka Declaration.
33.	Our general debate, which is about to be concluded, has been marked by numerous references to the problem of the security of air transport, and there have been many judgments and assessments made which deserve comment. We would have liked the Assembly to be concerned primarily with breaches of the law and international conventions, which are committed by authorities which have signed the conventions and which claim to be Members of our Organization. The best contribution to a serious debate on the question of air transport security and safety would have been the condemnation of the Tel Aviv authorities responsible for the kidnapping of two Algerian nationals on 14 August last.
34.	The gloomy picture of the international situation which we have just painted should not cause us to overlook certain grounds for hope for a better future for the international community. One of the reasons is to be found in the results of the World Youth Assembly  which was organized here last summer under the auspices of our Organization. The texts which were published by the Congress indicate in what direction the world is going: the right direction.
"
25,1970,BLR,"
71.	. We are today mourning the untimely death of the President of the United Arab Republic, Gamal Abdel Nasser, an outstanding statesman and acknowledged leader of the national liberation movement, and a great friend of the Soviet Union.
72.	Under the leadership of President Nasser the people of the United Arab Republic achieved considerable success in the development of the national economy and carried out a number of important social reforms; it also waged a decisive anti-imperialist struggle for the freedom and independence of its own country and of other peoples.
73.	We express our deep sympathy to the people and Government of the United Arab Republic and to the family of the deceased President.
74.	The delegation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic congratulates you, Mr. President, on your election to the office of President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, which we hope will leave a great mark in the history of the United Nations.
75.	We should like to take this opportunity to express our best wishes to the SecretaryGeneral of the United
Nations U Thant, who in the summer of this year paid an official visit to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and had useful talks with leaders of the Republic.
76.	The General Assembly is holding its twenty-fifth session in a year marked by some notable anniversaries connected with events of primary and permanent historical importance for the peoples of the whole world, and also for the United Nations..
77.	The year 1970 was the hundredth anniversary of the birth of V. I. Lenin, an outstanding thinker and revolutionary whose name is connected with the beginning of a new era in the history of mankind the era of the revolutionary transformation of the world in the interests of the workers. To Lenin, the founder of the first socialist State in the world, belongs the outstanding merit of preparing and implementing the peace-loving principles of socialist foreign policy. In accordance with those principles, the first Congress of Soviets of Byelorussia on 2 February 1919, i.e. one month after the foundation of the Republic, created as a result of the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, sent to all peoples a message which solemnly proclaimed, on behalf of the millions of workers and peasants of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, its will to live in peace and friendship with all peoples.
78.	Lenin's ideas on peace and peaceful coexistence between States with different social systems, the principle of proletarian internationalism, his ideas on ensuring the independence and equal rights of large and small States and peoples, equitable and mutually advantageous cooperation among all States, and their development along the path of economic and social progress, are gaining ever wider recognition. In substance they form the basis of all positive action on the international scene, including the work done in the context of the United Nations. It is natural that Lenin's anniversary snouid be widely celebrated in the United Nations and its specialized agencies.
79.	This year is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the great victory of the Powers of the antiHitlerite coalition over fascist Germany and militarist Japan. A decisive role in this victory was played by the Soviet Union which demonstrated the indestructibility of socialist achievements and freed many peoples from foreign enslavement. An important contribution to the defeat of fascism was also made by the Byelorussian people. More than one million Byelorussians fought fearlessly on the fronts of the Great Patriotic War, and on the temporarily occupied territory of Byelorussia more than 440,000 partisans and members of the underground carried out an active, organized struggle. One out of every four inhabitants of Byelorussia gave his life in the struggle for the victory over the dark forces of fascism, aggression and reaction. The heroism and unprecedented steadfastness of the Soviet people, in the struggle against fascism, will always remain in the memory of a grateful humanity.
80.	This year is also notable because it is already a quarter of a century since the time when victorious socialism extended beyond the frontiers of a single country and became an international force. The world socialist system emerged.
81.	The year 1970 is also the twenty-fifth anniversary of the signing of the Potsdam Agreement which formed the basis of the postwar peace settlement in Europe.
82.	Born in the fires of the Second World War, the United Nations owes its very existence to the victory of the peace-loving people over the fascist oppressors.
83.	The twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations is a suitable time in which to assess once again its activities, its achievements and shortcomings and, taking due account of the past, to map out the main directions of its future work.
84.	The viability of the United Nations depends on how actively and fruitfully it can comply with the high purposes and principles which were proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations twenty-five years ago and which are still applicable today and correspond to the interests of all people. We have primarily in mind the fulfillment of the main task of the Organization, which is the maintenance of international peace and security.
85.	Thanks to the efforts of the peace loving peoples, during the last quarter of a century mankind has now been subjected to the holocaust of a new world war. However, it has not on the whole known genuine peace either since the aggressive forces of imperialism have by their reckless policy frequently brought the world to the brink of a dangerous conflict. Today, as we sit in this hall, the imperialist forces are committing acts of aggression which are causing tension in international relations and creating a threat to world peace.
86.	A United States army half a million strong is waging an aggressive, barbarous war against the people of VietNam, which is defending its right to determine its own fate, its right to freedom, independence and unity. The United States of America has extended its aggressive action to the other peoples of IndoChina, taking a direct part or using the troops of its accomplices against the peoples of Cambodia and Laos. Making use of the so-calledF 'Guam doctrine', the United States is trying to make Asians fight against Asians, contrary to the interests of the peoples of Asia.
87.	The Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic resolutely condemns the American aggression against the VietNamese people and the other peoples of IndoChina, and demands the immediate, total and unconditional withdrawal of American troops and the troops of its allies from that area, and the strict observance of the Geneva agreements of 1954 and 1962. It demands the settlement of the VietNam problem on the basis of the proposals of the Democratic Republic of VietNam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South VietNam, which fully comply with the requirements and aspirations of the peoples of SouthEast Asia and ensure their right to live in conditions of peace without foreign intervention in their internal affairs.
88.	We condemn equally strongly the aggression of Israel against the Arab States and demand the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from all the occupied Arab territories.
89.	During the last three years the Arab States have done a great deal for the peaceful political settlement of the Middle East. They have supported a series of measures proposed in the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967 [242 (1967)], they have shown their willingness to solve the Middle East crisis by using the services of Ambassador Jarring, and have agreed to a complete ceasefire for the sake of achieving the purposes of the Security Council resolution. For all those years the Arab countries have enjoyed the unswerving support and assistance of the socialist States in the struggle for an early, just and peaceful political settlement of the Middle East conflict.
90.	Relying on the support of the imperialist and warlike Zionist circles in the United States of America and in other Western countries, Israel is continuing to exacerbate the situation in the Middle East. It not only refuses to carry out the resolutions of the Security Council, but it is hindering the renewal of contacts by the Special Representative of the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations with the interested parties on this subject. Israel is continuing to enlarge its military potential with the help of forces which are not interested in restoring the violated rights of the Arab peoples. The statement made on 28 September by the Foreign Minister of Israel [1851st meeting] once again made it perfectly clear that Israel is waging a struggle not for its own existence, not for its security, but for the conquest of foreign land. Such a course of events is fraught with serious consequences for the cause of peace.
91.	The Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic will continue to support the just struggle of the Arab peoples for the full implementation of the Security Council's decisions on eliminating the consequences of the Israeli aggression in the Middle East in the interests of peace and international security, and will continue to help the Arab peoples to achieve their rights to independence, sovereignty, and free national development.
92.	The anniversary session of the General Assembly has before it important tasks, and the States Members of the United Nations are called upon to make every effort to achieve the observance by every State of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, to prepare and carry out measures for the strengthening of international security, and on that basis to solve all other questions. The United Nations has a real opportunity of achieving tHs if it concentrates attention on the most important and urgent tasks.
93.	The socialist countries, including the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, propose that the Assembly should adopt the draft declaration on strengthening international security [AlC.lIL.513], that it should prepare a progressive final document on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, declare itself in favor of a specific, clearcut program for the final elimination of colonialism, that it should support the principles of international law concerning friendly relations and cooperation among States, and should propose concrete and effective ways for solving the problem of disarmament and other items on its agenda.
94. In the light of the determination proclaimed in the United Nations Charter to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to live together in peace and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security in present day conditions of the unceasing aggression of imperialist forces against the peoples of a number of countries, special importance attaches to measures proposed by the socialist States in the Declaration on strengthening international security. Among these first of all is the obligation, for every State:
'1. To abide in their international relations, by the and principles of the United Nations, including the principles of the sovereignty, equality and territorial inviolability of each State, noninterference in internal affairs and respect for the right of all peoples freely to choose their social system;
4>2. To refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations;
'3. To abide strictly by the principles of the inadmissibility of military occupation and the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory as a result of war or the use of force, in violation of the provisions of the Charter;
'4. To implement fully the decisions of the Security Council on the peaceful settlement of armed conflicts and the withdrawal of forces from territories occupied as a result of such conflicts, and also other decisions of the Security Council aimed at the maintenance of international peace and security;
'5. To comply, in accordance with their obligations under article 25 of the Charter, with decisions of the Security Council taken in exercise of its powers to suppress acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace;
'6. To cease all military and other action for the suppression of the liberation movements of peoples still under colonial or racist domination, and to provide active assistance to all these peoples in attaining their independence in accordance with their inalienable right to self-determination;
'7. To settle all disputes between States exclusively by peaceful means and, to this end, to make fuller use of the procedures and methods provided
for in the Charter, including those methods for the
settlement of disputes which, in accordance with the
Charter, may be applied by the Security Council.'
95.	The United Nations has had some success in approaching the solution of the problems of disarmament. Although the arms race, imposed on the world by the imperialist forces, continues and ever more countries, including the developing countries, are being drawn in, we can say that a number of agreements concluded on the initiative of the Soviet Union have had a good effect on the limitation of the arms race. Such agreements are: the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water; the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies [resolution 2222 (XXI)], which prohibits the placing of nuclear weapons and other means of mass destruction in outer space and provides for the demilitarization of the celestial bodies; the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] and a number of other agreements. We approve the draft treaty prepared by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament on the prohibition of the emplacement of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and the ocean floor and in the subsoil thereof.8 The delegation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic is in favor of an early conclusion of a convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical and bacteriological (biological) weapons and on the destruction of such weapons, submitted by the socialist countries including our own Republic.9
96.	In present day circumstances the United Nations and all States are faced with the task of intensifying efforts for the speedy attainment of agreement on general and complete disarmament, as well as agreement on individual measures to limit and put an end to the arms race and on disarmament.
97.	The draft declaration on strengthening international security speaks of the need to accelerate the attainment of agreement on United Nations peacekeeping operations, on the basis of strict compliance with the United Nations Charter. In this connexion we welcome the statement of Mr. Yost to the effect that peacekeeping operations should be placed on a firmer and more reliable basis. But in the formula he proposes there is, as before, a considerable omission. In his formula there is no provision by which all United Nations peacekeeping operations would be carried out strictly in accordance with the United Nations Charter and not as they were imposed during the years of the cold war. Hence the task of the Committee headed by Mr. Cuevas Cancino should be to fill this gap and to place the peacekeeping operations firmly and reliably on the stable basis of the Charter of the United Nations and not on a one-sided practice for the benefit of one restricted group of States
98.	Great importance is to be attached to the clause of the declaration which provides for the development of international cooperation on a regional basis for the purpose of strengthening security in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Charter, with the participation of all States in each region. Naturally we support measures to safeguard collective security in Europe and are in favor of an early convening of a PanEuropean conference on the questions of security and cooperation. In their memorandum of 22 June 1970 the States members of the Warsaw Treaty, guided by the desire to attain the agreement of the interested States, have taken an important step to meet the wishes of the other countries on the question of the membership of a PanEuropean conference, its agenda and the methods of preparing for such a conference. We are entitled to expect that those who so far have been hindering the convening of a conference will stop finding pretexts for delay so that the way will be opened for it to meet and to do fruitful work in the interests of peace, security and cooperation.
99.	In speaking on the problems of Europe, we welcome the signing of the Treaty between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Federal Republic of Germany  in which, on the basis of the recognition of the actual situation which has developed in Europe in the postwar years, the parties regard the maintenance of international peace and the easing of tension as important objectives of their policies. They express their desire to help to normalize the situation in Europe and to develop peaceful relations between all European States. The contracting parties express their conviction that peaceful cooperation among States on the basis of t he purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter corresponds to the aspirations of the peoples and the broad interests of international peace. The Treaty recognizes that peace in Europe can be maintained only if no encroachments are made on present day frontiers. The contracting parties undertake scrupulously to observe the territorial integrity of all the States of Europe within their present frontiers. They state that they have no territorial claims against anyone and that they will not put forward any such claims in the future.
100.	The Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany recognize as inviolable, now and in the future, the frontiers of all the States of Europe as they exist on the date of the signing of *he Treaty, including the OderNeisse line, which is the western frontier of the Polish People's Republic and the frontier between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic.
101.	The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Federal Republic of Germany, it is stressed in the Treaty, will be guided in their mutual relations, and also in questions relating to the safeguarding of European and international security, by the purposes and principles established in the United Nations Charter, In accordance faith this, they will resolve their disputes exclusively by peaceful means and undertake to refrain from the threat or use of force.
102.	It is difficult to overestimate the importance of this Treaty, which we hope will sqon come into force and will be strengthened by other agreements in the interests of safeguarding peace and security in Europe and for the purpose of developing cooperation among all the peoples of that continent.
103.	We hope that the further development of events in Europe and throughout the world will enable us to eliminate the possibility of the resurgence of fascism in all its forms. To attain this goal, all States should, in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations, put an end to all activity by Nazi, racist and other ultra-reactionary organizations. It is also important for all States to accede as soon as possible to
Convention on the NonApplicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity [resolution 2391 (XXIII), annex] and to punish persons guilty of committing such crimes.
104.	I now consider it necessary to deal with some questions relating to Korea. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has, during its years of popular rule, achieved considerable success in socialist construction. But the solution of the vital national problem of the Korean people the peaceful unification of the country on a democratic basis is being prevented by the United States occupation of South Korea and the illegal activities of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. Therefore a group of socialist and AfroAsian countries will try to achieve the adoption of a decision, with the participation of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on such questions as the withdrawal of the United States and all other foreign troops occupying South Korea under the flag of the United Nations, and the dissolution of the so called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. A constructive solution of these .questions, as proposed by the above mentioned group of countries, including the Byelorussian SSR, will ensure for the people of Korea the right to a free existence and national reunification without foreign intervention in accordance with the interests of the whole Korean people and the cause of peace in the Far East.
105.	Our age is an era of stormy revolutionary transformation and renovation of the world, in which a great role is played by the national liberation movement of the peoples. The Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia laid the foundation of the great historic revolutionary liberation process, which brought freedom to many millions of peoples enslaved by imperialism, caused the crisis in the colonial system and brought gbout its collapse. •
106.	In the twenty-five postwar years, tremendous changes have taken place in the world. On the political map of the world there have appeared more than seventy new sovereign States. The scientific prediction of the great Lenin concerning the increasing role of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America in international life and international relations has come true.
107.	The joint efforts of the socialist and the young independent countries led to the adoption, in 1960, on the initiative of the Soviet Union of the historic United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the tenth anniversary of which the world is celebrating this year. The Declaration has been a notable weapon in the hands of the struggling peoples of the colonies. It is no coincidence that since 1960 twenty-seven new States have appeared on the map of the world.
108.	However, colonialism has not yet disappeared from our planet. The increased activity of the neo-colonialist and racist forces in southern Africa and their unceasing attempts to suppress the struggle of the African peoples for freedom and independence by force of arms and terror confirm the correctness of the conclusion, drawn in the basic document of the International Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties, that the liberation of southern Africa, one of the last regions of colonial domination, is of great significance for the future of Africa and for the cause of peace.
109.	The time has come to eliminate the remaining strongholds of colonialism in Asia, Oceania, South America and the Caribbean.
110.	The major culprit in the continuing colonial oppression is international monopoly capital. The international monopolies grow fat on the plundering and seizure of the material resources of the colonies. And the Governments of the Western Powers do not take any measures to put a stop to the pernicious activities of the monopolies in colonial territories and disregard the relevant decisions of the United Nations.
111.	The history of colonialism and the economic plundering of the peoples of the colonial territories are indissolubly linked to the creation by the colonial Powers of strategic military bases in the enslaved territories. The colonial Powers must be made to fulfill the repeated demands of the United Nations General Assembly for the elimination of military bases in the colonies.
112.	The Byelorussian SSR has always been and always will be on the side of the peoples struggling for their national freedom and independence. The Byelorussian people support the legitimate struggle of the peoples of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau), Zimbabwe and Namibia, who are struggling against the South African, Portuguese and Southern Rhodesian racist colonialists and their imperialist protectors. Together with all the peace-loving peoples, the Byelorussian SSR calls for the cessation of assistance and support to the regimes of the South African Republic, Southern Rhodesia and Portugal by the United States, Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany and other Western Powers.
113.	Speaking recently from this rostrum [1848th meeting] the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who has long been known for his class hatred of communism, instead of clearly stating that his Conservative Government, in answer to the just demands of the peoples, intended to eradicate racism and apartheid from southern Africa, engaged in slanderous attacks on communism. But this shabby maneuver did not enable him to cover up his sympathies for the racists or his policy of affording the racists assistance, including the supply of weapons.
114.	The United Nations is called upon to do everything in its power to assist the implementation of the purposes proclaimed in the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, so that, in accordance with the special program of activity for its implementation, a speedy end can be put to the remnants of colonialism.
115.	As a result of the collapse of the colonial empires, the membership of the United Nations has considerably increased. But the United Nations has not yet become a universal organization: a number of States have not been admitted to membership. We have in mind primarily the German Democratic Republic, a peace-loving socialist State.
116.	It is time to put an end to the discriminatory practice of the Western Powers and particularly the United States with respect to the German Democratic Republic, and to admit it together with the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations, thus opening for it the possibility of taking a full part in the activity of other organs. Again, so far the rights of the Chinese People's Republic in the United Nations have not been restored to it.
117.	The majority of States are faced with vast and most difficult problems that remain to be solved in the field of economic and social development. Poverty, hunger, disease, racial discrimination and segregation, the intensification of exploitation, and unemployment are the lot of millions of people in the capitalist world. The backwardness of many countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, stemming from the colonialist and neo-colonialist systems of the imperialist Powers, remains one of the most tragic phenomena of modern times.
118.	The United Nations is called upon to ensure the implementation of the purposes and principles of its Charter in the economic and social fields. For that purpose it is necessary further to intensify the efforts of countries and peoples to improve the international situation, to solve the problem of disarmament, to make the appropriate social and economic changes and to develop wide economic and scientific-technical cooperation on a mutually advantageous and nondiscriminatory basis among all States irrespective of their social systems.
119.	The Byelorussian SSR is firmly in favor of the adoption by the United Nations of such decisions as will meet the demands of genuine economic and social progress. That is why we, together with other socialist countries, supported the idea and purposes of the United Nations Second Development Decade; and, sincerely wishing this Decade to become an important factor in the improvement of international economic relations, we made a statement on the second decade of development and social progress [A 18074], which represented a broad program of progressive political, social and economic measures which should be implemented at the national and international level for the solution of the most acute social and economic problems.
120.	In connexion with the important problem of financing the economic and social development of the developing countries, the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR considers that the time has now come for the United Nations to take specific steps to implement the indisputable rights of those countries for compensation for the material damage caused by the former colonial Powers, and also by the capitalist States which are still exploiting their resources on an inequitable and predatory basis.
121.	It would be appropriate and useful for the United Nations to determine the damage caused during the years of colonial domination of the countries and peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America, taking into account in particular the plundering of natural wealth and the exploitation of the human resources of the colonial territories, the profits and material and cultural wealth siphoned off to the metropolitan countries, the losses resulting from inequitable trade and from the deliberate development of predominantly one-crop economies, and also the adverse effects of a slow pace of social development in such spheres as education, social welfare and health. Besides this, it is important to determine the total sum of the present outflow of capital through all channels from the independent developing countries to the developed capitalist States. Finally, we should determine, if only approximately, the rate of amortization of the indebtedness thus incurred by the developed capitalist States during this historical period in respect of the developing countries and the peoples of the colonial territories.
122.	Undoubtedly such an assessment of damage and historical responsibility for the economic backwardness of developing States would help in achieving the aims of the United Nations Second Development Decade.
123.	The Byelorussian SSR, together with other socialist countries, has consistently carried out a policy of affording assistance of all kinds to the young independent States in overcoming the economic remnants of colonialism, in the creation and strengthening of an independent national economy, and in accelerating the pace of economic development.
124.	We understand how complicated and difficult are the problems facing the developing countries. The people of Soviet Byelorussia have had to overcome the backwardness inherited from their pre-revolutionary past. Moreover, twice in the lifetime of a single generation we have had to rebuild our national economy from ashes and ruins and restore what had been destroyed by the imperialist wars imposed upon us.
125.	Because of the great advantages of the socialist system, the brotherly assistance of the peoples of all the other socialist republics of the Soviet Union have ensured for us swift and stable economic development, and a steady growth in the material and cultural level of our people.
126.	The Byelorussian SSR, which was one of the founding members of the United Nations and took active part in the San Francisco Conference which, twenty-five years ago worked out the Charter of the United Nations, finds the statements and proposals of certain delegations for a revision of the Charter of the United Nations quite unacceptable. Strange as it may seem, those who initiated the proposal to revise the Charter have become particularly active during the period of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. We have the impression that their purpose is not, on the basis of the provisions of the Charter which have withstood the test of time and confirmed its present usefulness, to point to ways of increasing the effectiveness of the United Nations, but rather to undermine our Organization and destroy its foundations.
127.	It is noteworthy that the partisans of the revision of the Charter do not see, pr do not wish to see, that the United States aggression in SouthEast Asia, and the aggression of Israel in the Middle East, the maintenance of the remnants of colonialism, the resurgence of Nazism, and the existence of racism and apartheid, are not the result of any shortcomings of the Charter but of the flagrant violation of that Charter by the imperialists. Moreover, some of the critics of the Charter, who protect and even support the aggressors, are accomplices in the crimes committed against freedom-loving peoples, or else they take up the position of a bystander who does not see the danger of the policy and actions of the aggressors and the racist colonialists for the independence and security of peoples. That is also confirmed by some of their statements in the general debate.
128.	Under present conditions the most important task of all States is the strictest observance of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the intensification of joint efforts to ensure that those who violate them carry out a policy in full accord with the obligations imposed upon them by the United Nations Charter and by the most important and progressive decisions of the United Nations.
129.	The United Nations as a whole, and in particular the twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly, is faced with vast and responsible tasks, which deeply affect the broad masses of the working people.
130.	The United Nations has sufficient powers and possibilities to solve those problems. A guarantee of success is the consistent peace-loving policy of the socialist countries, their growing mutual understanding of and their cooperation with the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and the combined efforts of all the peace-loving and antiimperialist forces.
131.	We note with satisfaction that the recent decisions taken at its seventh session by the Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity  and the Third Conference of Heads of State and Government of NonAligned Countries on the maintenance and strengthening of peace and international security, on the cessation of acts of aggression, decolonization, and on the universality of the United Nations, coincide with our own position and broaden the front of fighters struggling to ensure that the activity of the United Nations promotes the development of human society along the path of peace, democracy and social progress.
132.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR, reflecting the urge and wish of the Byelorussian people, will do everything in its power to ensure that in the coming years the United Nations shall earn its due authority among all the peoples of the world by means of the preparation, adoption and implementation of very important decisions directed towards the strengthening of peace and security on the earth and promoting the development of international cooperation and the triumph of the great purposes and principles in the name of which the United Nations was founded.
