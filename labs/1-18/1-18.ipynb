We denote strings by surrounding the desired value with quotes. For example, \"Data Science\" and \"2017\" are strings, while `bears` and `2020` (both without quotes) are not strings (`bears` without quotes would be interpreted as a variable). You'll also be using decimal numbers in Python, which are called *floats* (positive and negative decimal numbers). \n",

Booleans are often used to check conditions; for example, we might have a list of dogs, and we want to sort them into small dogs and large dogs. One way we could accomplish this is to say either `True` or `False` for each dog after seeing if the dog weighs more than 15 pounds. \n",
