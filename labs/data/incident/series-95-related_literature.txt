This report is the first NCVS report to profile crime victims at work. It
provides data on the extent to which workplace violence occurs, whether
offenders are armed and whether they are strangers or nonstrangers, and the
extent of injury and time lost from work resulting from these crimes.

This BJS Special Report is the first release of the 1992-93 estimates of
violence against women after an extended effort to improve the
victimization survey's ability to measure violence against women. The
survey now asks more explicit and direct questions about sexual assaults
and other victimizations perpetrated by known offenders. Data include
annual number of violent victimizations, rapes, and sexual assaults against
women; number perpetrated by intimates (including husbands, ex-husbands,
boyfriends, and ex-boyfriends); rates for violence by intimates for women
versus rates for men; rates for violence and sexual assaults by strangers;
age and family income of female victims of violence; and rates of injury.

The crime level was comparable to that for the previous year; while violent
crime rates did not change significantly from 1991, rates of personal and
household theft fell. The robbery rate was lower in 1992 than at its
highest points in 1981 and 1982, and the rate of burglary was lower than at
any time during the previous two decades. The survey covered both reported
and unreported crimes; it found that motor vehicle theft was most likely to
be reported to police, while larcenies without victim-offender contact were
least likely to be reported. Blacks, persons under the age of 25, and
households with lower incomes were most likely to be victimized. However,
while households with low incomes were more susceptible to violent crimes,
theft rates did not differ significantly between low-income and high-income
households. Residents of central cities had higher victimization rates for
all person crimes than did residents of suburbs or nonmetropolitan areas. 3

This annual BJS Bulletin summarizes 1993 findings from the redesigned NCVS
and presents the first tabulations of 1992 data based on the redesigned
survey, an ongoing survey of households, each year interviewing about
100,000 persons in 50,000 households. In 1993, U.S. residents age 12 or
older experienced a total of 43.6 million crimes--nearly 11 million violent
victimizations and over 32 million property crimes. There were 52 violent
victimizations per 1,000 persons and 322 property crimes per 1,000
households. Violent crimes (a quarter of the total that victims described)
include rape and sexual assault, robbery, and both aggravated and simple
assault (from the victimization survey), and homicide (from crimes reported
to police). Property crimes are comprised of burglaries, motor vehicle
thefts, and thefts of other property. Improved NCVS survey procedures and a
revised questionnaire now enable BJS to count crimes that were excluded or
unreported in previous years. Of the 43.6 million criminal victimizations
that victims described in 1993, 10.9 million were rapes, robberies, or
assaults:
Violent victimization rates, the number of crimes during 1993 per 1,000
persons age 12 or older, included: Victims sustained a rape or some other
non-rape injury in over 2.6 million incidents in 1993; about 29% of the
robberies involved injury.

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an important source of
information on criminal victimization in the United States. Each year, data
are obtained from a nationally representative sample of about 40,000
households comprising nearly 75,000 persons on the frequency,
characteristics, and consequences of criminal victimization. The survey
enables the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to estimate the likelihood
of experiencing rape, sexual assault, robbery, assault, theft, household
burglary, and motor vehicle theft victimization for the population as a
whole, as well as for segments of the population. Virtually all data
collection efforts experience the challenge of missing data, and the NCVS
is no exception. The NCVS is a panel data collection effort with three
possible types of nonresponse: 1) unit, 2) wave, and 3) item. BJS uses
weight adjustments to account for unit and wave nonresponse; however
nothing is done to address item nonresponse. This missing data may result
in a potentially biased estimate. This is particularly problematic when it
comes to the measurement of household income, one of the NCVS items that
has historically suffered from high rates of nonresponse. As BJS works to
continually improve the utility of the NCVS for understanding changes in
crime and its correlates over time, the high levels of missing income data
has to be addressed to accurately establish associations between
victimization and socioeconomic factors, including income. Continuing to
omit the nonresponse income data may lead to false interpretations of the
data collected and biased survey results. It is recommended that imputation
methods be used to impute income data for the longitudinal data. Although
alternative methods for addressing missing data during analysis exist,
imputation is a common and trusted approach.

better understood as crime and its correlates change over time. Recently,
BJS has been interested in assessing the measurement of variables that have
long been associated with victimization, including factors such as
socioeconomic status (SES). The goals of this paper are to: 1) understand
how other studies have measured SES and identify variables within the NCVS
that could be used to measure or be proxies for SES; 2) explore options for
creating an SES index that could enhance BJS’s analysis of victimization
and its correlates; and 3) assess how components of a potential SES index
are currently measured in the NCVS and consider ways in which they can be
improved. Section 1 of the report summarizes the literature on how SES has
been measured in the scientific literature and how it relates to crime and
victimization. Section 2 summarizes the recommended approach for creating a
measure of SES via an index that includes imputed income data. Finally,
Section 3 recommends changes to the NCVS that would address the current
limitations and allow for better measurement of SES and its components.

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an important source of
information on criminal victimization in the United States. Each year, data
from a nationally representative sample of about 40,000 households
comprising nearly 75,000 persons are obtained on the frequency,
characteristics, and consequences of criminal victimization. The survey
enables the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to estimate the likelihood
of experiencing rape, sexual assault, robbery, assault, theft, household
burglary, and motor vehicle theft victimization for the population as a
whole, as well as for segments of the population. One of BJS’s goals for
the NCVS is to continually improve its utility so that victimization can be
better understood as crime and its correlates change over time. Recently,
BJS has been interested in assessing the measurement of variables that have
long been associated with victimization, including factors such as
socioeconomic status (SES). The goals of this paper are to: 1) understand
how other studies have measured SES and identify variables within the NCVS
that could be used to measure or be proxies for SES; 2) explore options for
creating an SES index that could enhance BJS’s analysis of victimization
and its correlates; and 3) assess how components of a potential SES index
are currently measured in the NCVS and consider ways in which they can be
improved. Section 1 of the report summarizes the literature on how SES has
been measured in the scientific literature and how it relates to crime and

Persons ages 12-24 have the highest victimization rates for all types of
crime, while those age 65 or older have the lowest. The violent crime rate
is nearly 16 times higher for persons under age 25 than for persons over
65. According to the FBI, 5 percent of the murder victims in 1992 were age
65 or older. The elderly appear to be particularly susceptible to crimes
motivated by economic gain. In addition, injured elderly victims of violent
crime are more likely than younger victims to experience a serious injury.
Elderly victims are also more likely than younger victims to have
assailants who are strangers. Elderly victims of robbery and personal theft
are more likely than younger victims to report those crimes to the police.

Crime of Violence? An Analysis of National Data 1998-2007." Final Technical

The analysis of national data on burglary obtained from Uniform Crime
Reports, National Crime Victimization Surveys (NCVSs), and the National
Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) for 1998-2007 indicates that the
majority of burglaries did not involve physical violence and there was weak
evidence of even the possibility of violence. The incidence of actual
violence or threats of violence during burglaries ranged from a low of 9
percent in rural areas based on NIBRS data, to a high of 7.6 percent in
urban areas based on NCVSs. At most, 2.7 percent involved actual violent
acts. A comprehensive content analysis of the provisions of State burglary
and habitual offender statutes, however, found that burglary is often
treated as a violent crime instead of prosecuting and punishing it as a
property crime, while separately charging and punishing convicted offenders
for any violent acts that occasionally co-occur with burglary. The
discussion of policy implications of these findings suggests reform of
current statutes that do not reflect the documented characteristics of
burglary offenses. It suggests that at a minimum, only burglary of an
occupied building be regarded as a serious crime; preferably, the revised
law should require that an actual act of violence or threatened violence
occur before burglary can be prosecuted as a violent crime. 3 figures, 13

The information covers rape, robbery, assault, larceny, burglary, and motor
vehicle theft. It details the frequency of each crime, the characteristics
of the victims and the offenders, the circumstances surrounding the
offenses and their impact, and the pattern of police reporting. Findings
show that victimization rates for violent crimes were about 68 percent
higher for males than for females. Youths age 12 to 24 had the highest
victimization rates for crimes of violence and crimes of theft. Blacks were
victims of violent crimes at higher rates than were whites or members of
other minority groups. For both violent and personal theft crimes, the rate
of victimization was greatest for central city residents, compared with
persons living in suburban areas, semirural areas, and rural areas.
Inhabitants of the west had the highest victimization rates; those in the
northeast, the lowest. People in the midwest had higher rates than those in
the south. Data tables and appended methodological information.

This report presents data from the American Housing Survey (U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development) and the BJS National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS). It finds that, similar to the Nation's general pattern of
violent victimization rates, household perceptions of crime as a problem
rose during the late 1980's and early 1990's and then leveled off. However,
differences in perception of crime and actual victimization are found. As
crime later dropped sharply from 1994 to 1995, perceptions that crime was a
neighborhood problem remained relatively stable. Black households were much
more likely than white households to indicate crime was a neighborhood
problem. In 1995, 2.5 times as many black households indicated crime was a
problem; but the difference was not nearly as large for actual
victimization: 27% of black households experienced one or more crimes,
compared to 23% of white households.

The FBI's UCR program, which began in 1929, collects information on the
following crimes reported to law enforcement authorities: homicide,
forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor
vehicle theft, and arson. Arrests are reported for 21 additional crime
categories. The UCR data are compiled from monthly law enforcement reports
or individual crime incident records transmitted directly to the FBI or to
centralized State agencies that then report to the FBI. The Bureau of
Justice Statistics NCVS program, which began in 1973, provides a detailed
picture of crime incidents, victims, and trends. U.S. Census Bureau
personnel interview all household members at least 12 years old in a
nationally representative sample of approximately 49,000 households. The
NCVS collects information on crimes suffered by individuals and households,
whether or not those crimes were reported to law enforcement. It estimates
the proportion of each crime type reported to law enforcement and
summarizes the reasons that victims give for reporting or not reporting
their victimization. As much as their different collection methods permit,
the UCR and the NCVS measure the same subset of serious crimes, defined the
same. This paper also reviews the differences in the two measures of crime
and how the two together provide a greater understanding of crime in the
United States than either does alone.

Tabular data show the victimization rates for persons age 12 and over by
place of residence (central city, suburbs, and nonmetropolitan areas) and
by crime type (violence or theft). Victimization rates are then broken down
to show victimization rates by place (central city, suburbs, and
nonmetropolitan area) for residents of each area type by crime type. Data
indicate that although the majority of personal crimes occurred in the
general areas where the victims lived, there were substantial differences
between areas and for certain crimes. Central city residents were more
likely to be victimized in the central city, especially by robbery and
larceny with contact. Suburban residents had the highest probability of
being victimized in other locations, although the majority of both violent
and theft crimes occurred in their own areas. For those victimized outside
their residential jurisdictions, there was a greater likelihood that
nonmetropolitan residents would be victimized in metropolitan areas and
that suburban residents would be victimized in central cities than vice
versa. National Crime survey methodology is explained, and Bureau of
Justice Statistics reports as of December 1985 are listed.

Generally, the NCS questions achieve their goal, i.e., to determine the
number of victimizations of household members for the NCS crimes. Still,
problems have been identified, especially with larceny incidents, stemming
from asking the household screening questions only once in households with
two or more eligible respondents. The distinction between household larceny
(which occurs in or near the home) and noncontact personal larceny (which
occurs elsewhere) is also shown to cause problems in assigning victim
characteristics. Larcenies of parts of cars are discussed as an example of
the difficulties posed by the current questioning procedure. It is advised
that this study did not address the larger issue of whether the screening
questions as now administered, even if they were all asked of everyone in
the household, are as productive as a potential alternative format. A
sample NCS questionnaire is provided.

Since 1972, the Bureau of the Census has conducted victimization surveys
known as the National Crime Survey (NCS) for LEAA. More than one million
interviews have been conducted to gather information about rape, robbery,
assault, burglary, larceny, and vehicle theft victimizations. In this
report, the development and methodology of the NCS is discussed in terms
understandable to the person who is not a professional research
methodologist. Included are sections on the nature of questions asked and
the availability of the data for various methods of classification.
Substantive research based on NCS data is surveyed, and methodological
research conducted to improve the survey program is discussed. The NCS is
broken down into city samples and a national sample. A supplement surveys
attitudes toward crime. Problems being researched are interviewing 12 and
13 year old respondents, the effect of the supplemental attitude
questionnaire, analysis of screening questions, and possible biases in
recall and reporting. Bibliographic references are given for readers who
wish more technical detail. Appendixes include the NCS household interview,
commercial interview, and city survey attitude questionnaires.

Abstract: http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=3343
Full text PDF: http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rvphc.pdf
The investigative steps used by a number of existing restitution programs
to determine victim losses are applied to a national sample of crime
victimizations collected by the National Crime Survey (NCS) for the
following crimes: unarmed robbery, purse snatching/pocket picking,
household burglary, larceny from the home, larceny elsewhere, and vehicle
theft. The report discusses the possible effects on such a program of
factors such as offenders' ability to pay, the low wages paid to
incarcerated offenders, the fact that many crimes reported to the NCS are
not reported to the police, the low arrest rates for those that are
reported, and the very low conviction rates for those that are arrested.
The report concludes that relatively few single victimizations are so
costly as to prohibit the possibility of restitution, even considering the
low earnings of most offenders, but that restitution can be expected to
restore the losses for only a very small minority of victims. A broad
program of victim compensation must rely on other remedies. The report also
discusses the history and background of restitution, with a list of
references, and includes 10 tables and 2 figures displaying national
estimates of loss, damage, recovery, inmate income, and arrest rates. The
investigative steps covered include type of loss (theft, damage, medical
expense, lost work time), gross amounts lost, police recovery, insurance
payments, net loss, earning capacity of offenders, and victims' relative
financial needs. (Author abstract modified).

Presents findings on the rates and levels of violent victimization
committed by offenders who were strangers to the victims, including
homicide, rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple
assault. The report presents annual trends and compares changes across
three 6-year periods in the incidence and type of violence committed by
strangers from 1993 through 2010. It describes the characteristics of
victims and circumstances of the violent crime. The nonfatal violent
victimization estimates were developed from the Bureau of Justice
Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which collects
information on nonfatal crimes, reported and not reported to the police,
against persons age 12 or older from a nationally representative sample of
U.S. households. The homicide data are from the FBI's Supplementary
Homicide Reports (SHR) for 1993 through 2008.

Identity theft is defined as the unauthorized use or attempted use of
existing accounts, or the unauthorized use or attempted use of personal
information to open a new account or for other fraudulent purposes. The
report details the number and percentage of persons age 16 or older who
reported at least one incident of identity theft over the past year. It
describes how the personal information was obtained, financial losses due
to identity theft, victim reporting to credit bureaus and police, and the
impact of identity theft on victims' lives. The report also presents a
lifetime prevalence rate for identity theft and information on the
preventative actions taken to avoid becoming a victim of identity theft.

Overall, the data show significant changes in the levels and rates of crime
in the United States since 1973. By 1988 the general crime level had fallen
to 14 percent below the level in the peak year of 1981. The victimization
rate for violent crimes showed the first measurable increase from 1973 to
1979. The rate reached a high of 35.3 violent crimes per 1,000 persons in
1981; the low as 28.1 in 1986. The rate did not change significantly after
1986. The personal theft victimization rate rose between 1973 and 1977,
when it peaked at 97.3 per 1,000 persons. After 1977 the rate fell rapidly
until 1986 when the lowest victimization rate, 67.5 per 1,000 persons, was
obtained. The rate rose slightly after 1986. The rate of household crimes
remained high from 1973 through 1981 and began to drop steadily in 1982; it
has remained stable since 1985. Since 1973 the percentage of crimes
reported to law enforcement authorities has increased significantly. 49

Presents data from the National Crime Victimization Survey about
carjackings that occurred during 1992-96. Carjacking is defined as
completed or attempted robbery of a motor vehicle by a stranger to the
victim. It differs from other motor vehicle theft because the victim is
present and the offender uses or threatens to use force. Carjackings
resulting in murder of the victim(s) are not covered by the National Crime
Victimization Survey. According to FBI data, however, each year about 26
homicides by strangers involved automobile theft. These incidents may have
been carjackings. The report includes the incidence of carjacking;
demographic characteristics of victims and offenders, such as age, race and
sex; and characteristics of the incident, such as time and place of
occurrence and weapon use.

These costs included losses from property theft or damage, cash losses,
medical expenses, and the amount of pay lost because of injury or
activities related to the crime. The crimes included in this figure are
rape, robbery, assault, personal and household theft, burglary, and motor
vehicle theft. Crimes included attempts as well as completed offenses.
Economic loss of some kind occurred in 71 percent of all personal crimes,
including rape, robbery, assault, and personal theft. For the violent
crimes of rape, robbery, and assault, economic loss occurred in 23 percent
of victimizations. Household crimes of burglary, theft, and motor vehicle
theft involved economic loss in 91 percent of all victimizations. A total
of 33,649,340 victimizations occurred in 1992. About 12 percent of personal
crimes and 24 percent of household crimes involved economic losses of $500
or more. Additional findings, tables, figures, and list of other BJS

Rape cases during this 10-year-period were aggregated into a single data
set consisting of 1,082 cases which represent a national total of 1.5
million instances of rape or attempted rape. Only about half the victims of
rape or attempted rape surveyed stated that the crime had been reported to
the police. Two-thirds of all rapes and rape attempts occurred at night,
with the largest proportion occurring between 6 p.m. and midnight. Most
victims of rape or attempted rape were white and young; the ages with the
highest victimization rates for rape and attempted rape were 16 to 24. More
than half of all victims had never been married and most were members of
low-income families. The most frightening form of rape, an assault by a
total stranger, was the most common. More than 75 percent of all rapes
involved one victim and one offender, and most offenders were unarmed. Most
victims offered some form of resistance. The most common responses to the
situation were trying to get help; resisting physically; to threatening,
arguing, or reasoning with the offender; or resisting without force. The
total cost of medical expenses reported was almost $72 million. Sixteen
tables showing study data are included.

The study analyzed the largest probability sample of sexual assault
incidents available, which was derived from the National Crime
Victimization Survey for 1992-2002. In order to provide a basis for
comparison, assault cases that involved female victims were also analyzed.
The final samples consisted of 733 rape attacks, 1,278 sexual assaults, and
12,235 assault incidents that involved female victims. The study
methodology sought to remedy weaknesses of prior data and research
methodologies, which have included small nonprobability samples, failing to
consider the temporal sequence of victim protective actions and injury,
lumping various victim protective actions into two or three broad
categories, and failing to control for relevant circumstances. Logistic
regression analysis in the current study found that most SP actions, both
forceful and nonforceful, significantly reduced the risk of rape completion
regardless of conditions, such as whether the offender was a sexual
intimate, whether the offender was under the influence of alcohol or other
drugs, whether there were multiple offenders, and whether the attacks
occurred at home or at night. In assault incidents, most SP tactics
apparently reduced the risk of injury and serious injury compared to
nonresistance. SP actions that significantly reduced the risk of injury
included 'attacking without a weapon,' 'threatening without a weapon,'
'running away/hiding,' and 'calling the police.' The only SP actions that
apparently raised the risk of injury were ambiguous and nonforceful tactics
such as 'stalling/cooperation,' and 'screaming from pain or fear.'

This study was conducted because the typical annual victimization rates
alone do not convey the full impact of crime as it affects people. Lifetime
likelihoods of victimization were calculated from National Crime Survey
annual victimization rates and life tables published by the National Center
for Health Statistics. The probability that a person will be victimized at
a particular age depends on the probability that the person is alive at
that age and the probability that a person of that age will be victimized.
The lifetime likelihood of personal victimization is derived from the
probabilities of being victimized at the various ages that constitute a
lifetime. A similar method is used for calculating the long-term likelihood
of crimes against households. For crimes against the person, the lifetime
likelihood of victimization is presented for violent crimes, rape, robbery,
assault, robbery or assault resulting in injury, and personal theft. The
long-term likelihood of household victimization is presented for burglary,
household larceny, and motor vehicle theft. 3 tables and 3 notes.

This study was conducted because the typical annual victimization rates
alone do not convey the full impact of crime as it affects people. Lifetime
likelihoods of victimization were calculated from National Crime Survey
annual victimization rates and life tables published by the National Center
for Health Statistics. The probability that a person will be victimized at
a particular age depends on the probability that the person is alive at
that age and the probability that a person of that age will be victimized.
The lifetime likelihood of personal victimization is derived from the
probabilities of being victimized at the various ages that constitute a
lifetime. A similar method is used for calculating the long-term likelihood
of crimes against households. For crimes against the person, the lifetime
likelihood of victimization is presented for violent crimes, rape, robbery,
assault, robbery or assault resulting in injury, and personal theft. The
long-term likelihood of household victimization is presented for burglary,
household larceny, and motor vehicle theft. 3 tables and 3 notes.

Presents findings on the theft of firearms during household burglaries and
other property crimes from 2005 through 2010. The report examines the
number of property crime victimizations involving the theft of one or more
firearms, the number of firearms stolen each year, and the characteristics
of property crimes involving stolen firearms. It presents data by the
amount of loss, the percentage reported to police, the percentage of items
recovered, and the characteristics of households experiencing the theft.
The report also presents trends from 1994 through 2010 on the number of
victimizations involving firearm theft. Data are from the National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS), which collects information on nonfatal crimes,
reported and not reported to the police, against persons age 12 or older
from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.

characteristics of the victim and the incident, such as the victim-offender
relationship, injury, weapon use, and demographic characteristics. It
examines the emotional and physical symptoms associated with socio-
emotional problems, and the association between victim help-seeking
behaviors and the experience of socio-emotional problems. Data are from the

The personal crimes of rape, robbery, assault, and personal larceny (purse
snatching and pocket picking) and the commercial crime of robbery are
examined. The questions focus on the patterns, nature, and consequences of
victimization across urban, suburban, and rural areas. The analysis of
victimization patterns across the urban-rural dimension showed that overall
victimization rates were higher in urban than in suburban and rural areas.
Assault, while quite common in both urban and rural areas, accounted for a
larger proportion of all rural crimes than urban crimes. These patterns
held for juveniles, youthful offenders, and adults. Data on the nature of
victimization across the urban-rural dimension indicated a larger
proportion of victimizations by strangers in urban areas, while lone
offenders were more prevalent in rural areas. Finally, an examination of
the consequences of victimization according to the extent of urbanization
revealed there were no substantial differences in the proportion of
completed robberies across the urban-rural dimension for any of the
offender age groups. Financial loss did not vary with the extent of
urbanization and most financial losses reported by victims were relatively
small. In addition, the proportion of the victims injured during the course
of a robbery or assault was the same in urban, suburban, and rural areas.
However, the proportion of injured victims increases with the age of the
offender for the crime of robbery. Six figures and 14 tables present
statistics and crime rates described in the report. National Crime Survey
data and survey instruments are appended. Approximately 50 references are
included.

general patterns of victims' responses to being asked, 'How many times did
this type of incident occur?' and provides data on how reports of high-
frequency repeat victimizations have changed over time. It describes how
different procedures for counting series victimizations would affect
estimates of the level and annual rate of change in victimization for
various crime types and incident characteristics. The report also describes
how BJS will change its counting practices for estimating annual
victimization rates in future reports.

United States from 1993 to 2010. Seasonal patterns are periodic
fluctuations in the victimization rates that tend to occur at the same time
each year. The report describes seasonal patterns in property crime
(burglary, motor vehicle theft, and other household theft) and violent
victimization (rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and
simple assault). It also presents seasonal trends in other forms of
violence, including intimate partner violence, victimizations involving a
weapon, and violence resulting in injury.

fluctuations in the victimization rates that tend to occur at the same time
each year. The report describes seasonal patterns in property crime
(burglary, motor vehicle theft, and other household theft) and violent
victimization (rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and
simple assault). It also presents seasonal trends in other forms of
violence, including intimate partner violence, victimizations involving a
weapon, and violence resulting in injury.

Intended for an audience that is not trained in statistics, this report
graphically presents violent crime trends from the National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS). Because the NCVS is based on the victimization
experience of a sample of U.S. households, the rates and numbers from it
are estimates which, by definition, are not exact. This report discusses
the precision of these estimates to aid readers in interpreting the data
over time. Included are graphics depicting violent crime rates from 1973 96
and 1995 96 changes for the crimes of rape, robbery, aggravated and simple
assault, and murder. In the context of the NCVS, the report discusses
sampling, statistical significance, and statistical inference. Also
included are two appendices concerning additional information on basic
statistical principles and the data used in the graphics.

Presents estimates on property and fatal and nonfatal violent victimization
against persons age 65 or older from 2003 to 2013. The report examines
patterns of victimization over time and the distribution of violent
victimization by the victim-offender relationship, victim 's disability
status, victim and incident characteristics, reporting to police, injuries
sustained during the victimization, and identity theft victimization
against the elderly. Nonfatal violent and property victimization data are
from the National Crime Victimization Survey and homicide data are from
mortality data based on death certificates in the National Vital Statistics
System of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention' s (CDC) Web-based Injury Statistics Query
and Reporting System (WISQARS).

Perceptions of victimization risk include the student's memory of direct
experience (or nonexperience) with victimization; the student's perception
of risk-relevant aspects of the school environment; and the student's
perception of risk, which can be inferred to result from different
sociodemographic characteristics (for example, age, sex, social class). Two
related data sets were used for the study: the annual National Crime Survey
and the School Crime Supplement, one of the special-topic supplements to
the National Crime Victimization Surveys. The data used in this study were
collected from January 1, 1989, to June 30, 1989. The survey responses
analyzed were from approximately 10,000 students aged 12 to 19. The bulk of
the data analysis consisted of testing just over 35 hypotheses and sub-
hypotheses, and the primary methods of analysis were cross- tabulation and
log-linear analysis. The main variables analyzed were actual criminal
victimization; fear of victimization; perceived risk in the school
environment; avoidance of particular locations at school; poor attendance
at school; bringing things to school for self-protection; public versus
private schools; grade structure of the school; level of urbanization; and
such sociodemographic data as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and family income.
The study found a linkage between perceived risk in the school environment
and the respondents' own reported experience of violent victimization.
Violent victimization was in turn strongly associated with bringing
something to school to protect themselves, staying away from particular
places at school and on the way to and from school, and staying home
because of fear. 11 tables and 2 references

This annual final report gives detailed 1993 NCVS findings, presenting the
major variables measured in the survey in detailed data tables. Crimes
covered by the survey include rape, robbery, assault, personal and
household larceny, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft. Tables
cover victim characteristics (sex, age, race, ethnicity, marital status,
education, income, and residence); crime characteristics (time and place of
occurrence, distance from home, weapon use, self-protection, injury,
medical care, economic loss, and time lost from work); victim-offender
relationship; substance use by offenders; offender characteristics (age,
race, and sex); whether crimes were reported to police; reasons for
reporting or not; and police response time for reported crime.

This annual BJS Bulletin presents the first 1994 findings from the National
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), based on an ongoing survey of
households, each year interviewing about 100,000 persons in 50,000
households. In 1994, U.S. residents age 12 or older experienced more than
42 million crimes: about 11 million violent victimizations and 31 million
property crimes. Violent crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery,
and both aggravated and simple assault (from the NCVS), and homicide (from
crimes reported to the police). The violent crime rate has been essentially
unchanged since 1992, following a slight increase between 1985 and 1991.
Property crime continued a 15-year decline. Property crimes include
burglaries, motor vehicle thefts, and thefts of other property. Victims
reported approximately a third of all property crimes. Motor vehicle theft
was the most frequently reported crime (78%), and theft of other property
was the least reported crime (27%). This report also summarizes other
findings, including the extent to which crimes are reported to the police,
the characteristics of victims, and comparisons between 1993 and 1994
victimization rates and levels. Both 1993 and 1994 findings are based on
the redesigned survey that was phased into the sample beginning in 1992.

Summarizes the U.S. Department of Justice's two primary statistical
programs that measure the magnitude, nature, and impact of crime in the
nation. This report describes the strengths, limitations, differences, and
complementary aspects of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program
and the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS). The UCR Program compiles crime data from law enforcement agencies
and presents crime counts for the nation, regions, states, and cities. The
NCVS interviews a nationally representative sample of U.S. households about
crimes reported and not reported to police and produces national estimates
of criminal victimization.

Presents trends in the rate of completed or attempted rape or sexual
assault against females from 1995 to 2010. The report examines demographic
characteristics of female victims of sexual violence and characteristics of
the offender and incident, including victim-offender relationship, whether
the offender had a weapon, and the location of the victimization. The
report also examines changes over time in the percentages of female victims
of sexual violence who suffered an injury and received formal medical
treatment, reported the victimization to the police, and received
assistance from a victim service provider. Data are from the National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS), which collects information on nonfatal crimes,
reported and not reported to the police, against persons age 12 or older
from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.

This figure represents a decrease of 1 percent from 1992 figures and the
lowest recorded since 1975. The marginal decrease was caused by a fall in
the number of households victimized by burglary or theft. Five percent of
households had at least one member age 12 or older who was the victim of a
violent crime. Black households were more likely to be victimized than
white households, and Hispanic households were more vulnerable than non-
Hispanic ones. Urban households were the most likely to sustain a crime,
while rural households experienced the lowest crime rates. In general, the
more people in a household, the greater its susceptibility to crime
victimization. Respondents to the survey perceived burglaries and violent
crimes committed by strangers to be the most threatening. 6 tables, 3
figures, and 11 notes

Presents the annual estimates of rates and levels of personal and property
victimization and describes the year-to-year change from 2007 as well as
trends for the ten-year period from 1999 through 2008. The National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS) collects information on nonfatal crimes,
reported and not reported to the police, against persons age 12 or older
from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households. During 2008,
42,093 households and 77,852 individuals were interviewed twice for the
NCVS. The report includes data on violent crimes (rape/sexual assault,
robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault), property crimes (burglary,
motor vehicle theft and property theft), and personal theft (pocket picking
and purse snatching), and the characteristics of victims of these crimes.
The report also includes estimates of intimate partner violent crime and
use of firearms and other weapons in the commission of violent crime
overall.

After defining burglary, the report profiles burglarized households
according to race of household head, family income, tenure and number of
units in structure, and geographic location -- urban, rural, or suburban.
Data on seasonal fluctuations and time of day reveals that burglaries were
more frequent during the warmer months, but that time of occurrence was
about evenly divided between day and night. Also examined are proportions
of burglaries that resulted in theft or property damage and factors that
affect whether a burglary is reported to the police. The statistical data
indicated that peoples' fears that a burglar may harm a household member
who happens to be present during the incident are well-founded. Over the
10-year period, unlawful entry showed a moderate decrease while completed
and attempted forcible entry rates remained substantially the same. Charts
and tables are included.

This percentage was identical in 1980 and only 2 percent lower than in
1975. Black households, higher income households, and households in central
cities were most vulnerable to crime. Larcenies were the most pervasive of
the measured crimes, with more than 20 percent of all households
experiencing at least one larceny. In addition, 7 percent of all households
were the target of at least one completed attempted burglary, and members
of 6 percent of the households were victims of violent crime, either by
strangers or family members/acquaintances. A total of 11 percent of all
households were touched by crimes of 'high concern' -- household burglary
and violent crime by strangers (rape, robbery, or assault). These
statistics are derived from National Crime Survey data. Detailed findings
and graphs are presented.

In 1982, households with high incomes, those in central cities, and those
headed by blacks continued to be most vulnerable to crime. A fifth of the
Nation's households were victimized by larcenies, the most common crime,
while 7 percent were victims of attempted or completed burglary, and 6
percent had a member who was a violent crime victim. The percentage of
households touched by crimes other than personal larcenies without contact
did not fluctuate greatly between 1975-82. Statistical tables, graphs,

the NCS. As in the previous 2 years, about 1 in 4 American households
experienced one of the crimes discussed. This is well below the almost 1 in
3 households touched by crime in 1975. In 1987, as in earlier years,
households with high incomes, households in urban areas, and black
households were more vulnerable to crime than others. In addition, Hispanic
households were more vulnerable to crime than non-Hispanic households.
Households in the Northeast were the least vulnerable to crime, while those

For each year during this period, about 4 in every 10 criminal
victimizations by armed offenders involved strangers. Since 1976, violent
crime by unknown offenders with guns was between 13 and 14 percent, except
in 1983 when it was 11 percent. About 25 percent of violent crimes by
strangers resulted in injury, a percentage that remained relatively stable
over time. Assault was the most frequent violent crime, followed by
robbery, and rape. Robbery victims who took no self-protective measures
were less likely to be injured than those who did. Since 1981,
victimization rates for men have decreased more than those for women.
Victimization rates for blacks increased up to 1981, then decreased; while
that for whites showed little change until decreasing since 1982. Although
urban areas had the highest violent crime rates, urban rates have decreased
more since 1981 than those in suburban and rural areas. Finally, crime
rates for persons under 35 years old rose during the 1970's, while those
for older groups remained stable or fell. 3 tables and 8 figures.

Among violent crimes, robbery was most likely and homicide was least likely
to be committed by a stranger. Most violent crimes by strangers (70
percent) were committed against males, while most by relatives (77 percent)

of all crimes by relatives and about two-thirds of all crimes by relatives
against women. Crimes by strangers were more often committed by two or more
offenders than were crimes by nonstrangers. Stranger-to-stranger crimes
more often involved a weapon but less often resulted in attack or injury
than did crimes by a nonstranger. Crimes by relatives involved attack and

are rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault
(from the NCVS), and homicide (from the FBI's UCR program). Property crimes
include burglaries, motor vehicle thefts, and thefts of other property. The
findings are based on a redesigned NCVS that was phased in beginning in
1992.

Using the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), this report examines
violent crimes committed against Hispanic victims including rape, sexual
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault. Crime
victimizations of Hispanics are compared with those of four non-Hispanic
groups: whites, blacks, American Indians, and Asians. Additional findings
include 1993-2000 victimization rates by victim characteristics (gender,
age, marital status, household income, and location of residence) and crime
characteristics (victim-offender relationship, presence of weapons,
injuries and medical treatment, alcohol/drug use of offender, and reporting
violence to the police).

This report presents information necessary to keep crime down in school and
students safe. Establishing good indicators of the current state of school
crime and safety across the Nation and regularly updating and monitoring
these indicators are important steps in ensuring the safety of the Nation's
students. Preliminary data show that there were 33 school-associated
violent deaths1 from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010. In 2010, among
students ages 12-18, there were approximately 828,000 nonfatal
victimizations at school, which include 470,000 victims of theft and
359,000 victims of violence (simple assault and serious violence). In 2009-
2010, about 74 percent of public schools recorded one or more violent
incidents of crime, 16 percent recorded one or more serious violent
incidents, and 44 percent recorded one or more thefts. This report covers
topics such as victimization, teacher injury, bullying, school conditions,
fights, weapons, availability and student use of drugs and alcohol, and
student perceptions of personal safety at school. Indicators of crime and
safety are compared across different population subgroups and over time.
Data on crimes that occur away from school are offered as a point of
comparison where available. The indicators in this report are based on
information drawn from a variety of data sources, including national
surveys of students, teachers, and principals. Tables, figures, and

Presents data from the redesigned National Crime Victimization Survey,
examining injuries as a result of violent victimizations. This report was a
joint effort of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and BJS. It
describes the nature and severity of injuries caused by rape, robbery, and
aggravated and simple assault, comparing victims' injuries by
characteristics of the victim and offender including relationship, age,
sex, and race/ethnicity. The report also compares the likelihood of an
injury from a violent crime by characteristics of the incident such as time
of day, location, victim's activity, and the presence of weapons. The
percentages of victims informing police and receiving medical care are also
examined by severity of injury.

Compares the characteristics of rape and sexual assault victimization
against females ages 18 to 24 who are enrolled and not enrolled in college.
This report examines the relationship between the victim and offender, the
involvement of a weapon, location of the victimization, reporting to
police, perceived offender characteristics, and victim demographics. Data
are from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which collects
information on nonfatal crimes, reported and not reported to the police,
against persons from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.
The report also discusses methodological differences between the NCVS and
other surveys that measure rape and sexual assault victimization and the
impact of these difference on rape and sexual assault estimates.

Compares the characteristics of rape and sexual assault victimization
against females ages 18 to 24 who are enrolled and not enrolled in college.
This report examines the relationship between the victim and offender, the
involvement of a weapon, location of the victimization, reporting to
police, perceived offender characteristics, and victim demographics. Data
are from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which collects
information on nonfatal crimes, reported and not reported to the police,
against persons from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.
The report also discusses methodological differences between the NCVS and
other surveys that measure rape and sexual assault victimization and the
impact of these difference on rape and sexual assault estimates.

This report presents the 1995 findings from the National Criminal
Victimization Survey (NCVS), an ongoing survey of households that each year
interviews about 100,000 persons in 50,000 households. Violent crimes
included in the report are rape, sexual assault, robbery, and both
aggravated and simple assault (from the NCVS), and homicide (from crimes
reported to the police). Property crimes include burglaries, motor vehicle
thefts, and thefts of other property. This report describes the major
declines in violent and property crime overall, 1994-95. Presenting each
type of victimization measured by characteristics of victims or victim's
households. Fourteen tables provide rates from 1992 to 1995 and 2 tables
summarize data from 1995. Electronic versions include additional tables.

The assessment has focused on data accuracy, survey methodology, and the
enhancement of options for data analysis. In addition to changes in the way
crime incident data are elicited and organized, the NCS redesign also
examined the techniques used to collect data, including sample design, data
collection technologies, and respondent rules. Revisions are being made to
improve the analytic data set as well. The changes include altering the
scope of crimes measured by the NCS, adding questions to provide new
independent variables, revising questions dealing with the outcomes of
crime, and including topical supplements to the NCS on a regular basis. The
Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Census Bureau have agreed on a four-
component comprehensive plan for the remaining implementation: testing,
phase-in, statistical splice, and processing system.

Domestic violence includes victimization committed by current or former
intimate partners (spouses, boyfriends or girlfriends), parents, children,
siblings, and other relatives. This report focuses on the level and pattern
of domestic violence over time, highlighting selected victim and incident
characteristics. Incident characteristics include the type of violence, the
offender's use of a weapon, victim injury and medical treatment, and
whether the incident was reported to police. The report provides estimates
of acquaintance and stranger violence for comparison. Data are from the
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which collects information on
nonfatal crimes reported and not reported to police. The NCVS is a self-
report survey administered every six months to persons age 12 or older from
a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.

Presents data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) on
nonfatal violent crime involving members of a household as victims and
reports on the annual prevalence of that violent crime among U.S.
households with children from 1993 to 2010. The report estimates the number
of children age 17 or younger living in households in which at least one
household member age 12 or older experienced violent crime during a given
year. As defined in NCVS, nonfatal violent victimizations include rape,
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault. Estimates
of the number of children are provided by age of children (ages 0 to 11 and
ages 12 to 17), type of crime, and location of the crime. The report also
examines households that experienced violent crime by whether children
lived in the household, type of crime, and location of the crime. Data on
victimized households by type, composition, and characteristic are also
presented.

The NCS collects information on personal and household crimes, including
those not reported to the police, from persons aged 12 and over in a
nationally representative household sample. Nearly all the information on
12 and 13 year olds was provided by adult household members. Juveniles had
higher annual violent crime and theft victimization rates than did adults
for 1983-1984. Trends in juvenile victimizations for 1973-1984 are similar
to those for the general population, with theft victimizations tending to
decline and violent victimizations remaining stable. Information on crime
characteristics covers place and time of occurrence, weapons used, self-
protective measures used, victim injuries and medical care, and number of
victims and offenders. Offender characteristics encompass sex, race, age,
and relationship to the victim. Violent and theft crimes against juveniles
were less likely to be reported to police than those committed against
adults. 18 data tables.

The survey results indicated that teenagers were twice as likely as adults
to experience crimes of theft and even more likely to be victims of violent
crimes. Older teenagers had higher victimization rates than younger
adolescents; teenage males and teenagers living in urban areas were also at
higher risk of victimization. Black adolescents were three to five times
more likely than white teens to be murder victims and also more likely to
be victims of robbery or aggravated assault. Violent crimes against
teenagers were more likely than crimes against adults to be committed by
offenders of similar age, sex, and race. Crimes of violence committed
against younger teenagers were much less likely to be reported to police
than crimes against adults. About half of violent crimes against teenagers
occurred in school buildings, on school property, or on the street; street
crimes were three times more likely than school crimes to involve a weapon.

Presents counts and rates of hate crime victimization in 2012, using data
from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The tables show change
in the number and rate of hate crime victimizations since 2011 and during
the 10-year period since 2003. They examine the perceived motivation for
the hate crime, demographic characteristics of victims and offenders, and
the percentage of hate crime reported to police. In addition, the tables
compare characteristics of hate crime and nonhate crime victimization, and
the NCVS and FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) hate crime statistics.

Crime reporting data are presented for rape, robbery, aggravated assault,
simple assault, purse snatching, pocket picking, larceny without contact,
burglary, household larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Tabular data
encompass whether the crime was reported, the proportion of completed and
attempted crimes reported, the percent of violent crimes reported by degree
of injury, and the percent of crimes reported by theft and damage monetary
loss. Data also cover the percent of crimes reported by victim
characteristics (sex, race, age, family income, and educational level).
Distribution of crimes reported by the victim, other household member, the
police, and someone else is indicated. Data are shown by crime type, injury
existence, and value of loss. Reasons for not reporting by crime type are
enumerated under the following categories: not serious, nothing could be
done, the police would not do anything, reported to someone else, a private
matter, inconvenient, and afraid of offender reprisal. The most important
reasons for reporting by crime type are also enumerated. National Crime
Survey methodology is summarized, and Bureau of Justice Statistics reports
as of December 1985 are listed.

This report supported by the U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute
of Justice (NIJ) presents a summary and analysis of literature on alcohol-
and drug-related crime in American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN)
communities. The report begins with an analysis of the epidemiology of
AI/AN substance abuse providing a better understanding of the nature of
alcohol and other drug use that co-occurs with AI/AN crime. Highlights of
key points that emerged include: (1) national surveys indicate AI/ANs are
more likely than the general public to report being symptomatic of alcohol
and drug use disorders as defined in the American Psychiatric Association’s
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and (2) alcohol and
drug use among AI/AN youth has been the subject of a considerable amount of
research, most of which indicates a higher lifetime prevalence relative to
the general population. After examining existing research on substance
abuse and crime in AI/AN communities, higher levels of alcohol involvement
in AI/AN crime was found and AI/ANs who use alcohol were more likely to be
a crime victim or perpetrator. The report also examined research on policy
responses to the problem of drug- and alcohol-involved crime among AI/ANs.
With the exception of one policy, local alcohol prohibition, very little is
known about the effects of criminal justice policy and specific initiatives
aimed at reducing alcohol and drug related crime in AI/AN communities. The
report presents and discusses a number of research approaches that have the
potential to improve the understanding of legal and criminal justice
responses to alcohol and drug related crime in AI/AN communities. Tables

The study found that criminal victimization was less strongly associated
with moving among Blacks and Hispanics compared with White households.
Under certain circumstances, however, victimization can significantly
increase the likelihood that minority households will move after
victimization. This was particularly the case for Black households that had
suffered a property loss in their victimization. Moving behavior was also
related to housing market conditions; residential racial segregation
reduces housing opportunities for minority residents, particularly Black
households. For Hispanic households, the analysis of the victimization
mobility pattern produced estimates with relatively large standard errors.
This suggests the need for larger samples and attention to the sub-group
diversity among Hispanics. The author predicts that as the U.S. population
becomes more racially and ethnically diverse, as has been projected by the
U.S. Census Bureau, the patterns of Black and Hispanic mobility observed in
this study will be more significant in influencing national population
flows. 8 tables, 1 figure, 85 references, and appended map of metropolitan

This report of selected findings examines murders, rapes, robberies, and
assaults committed by spouses, ex-spouses, boyfriends, or girlfriends. It
uses data from the BJS National Crime Victimization Survey, the BJS survey
of murder cases disposed in large urban counties in 1988, and the FBI
Supplementary Homicide Report from the Uniform Crime Reports program. Data
on violent offenders were collected in the 1991 Survey of State Prison
Inmates and the 1989 Survey of Jail Inmates. The findings show that females
experienced more than 10 times as many incidents of violence committed by
an intimate as did males -- 572,000 versus 49,000.
