There were four horses, these two were chestnut cart mares, one was six years old, and the other nine. They had no shoes on then, but had worn shoes for years. I missed them the next morning, and traced them out of the gate, but no further; I have seen them since. THOMAS PIGGOTT . I am hostler at the Blue Anchor, public-house, near Godstone. On the night before the prosecutor's mares were missed. I saw the prisoner Home at the house about six o'clock in the evening, in company with another (not Cutts), he left at eleven o'clock at night. I believe they only had one pint of beer all the time, neither of them had horses - I do not know what they came for.COURT. Q. How far is your house from the prosecutor's - A. Three quarters of a mile. They said they were going on to the next town.MR. DAVID GETTING . I am proprietor of the two mares. On the morning of the 14th, I was informed they were stolen; they are worth 25 l. each. I made the best of my way to London, and in consequence of information which I received, went with Rice, an officer of Union Hall, to several places in Paddington, and enquired if any horse-dealers lived there - we went to No. 8, Canal wharf, Paddington, to two stables, one was locked and the other padlocked; the door of the padlocked stable was partly open. I looked in, and immediately recognized one of my mares, I could see her distinctly, and the other behind it, I thought was mine, but could not see that distinctly. In consequence of information, the officer sent for Cutts, who came; he was known there by the name of Smith, only. I told him I and my man were going to town to buy a cart horse (my man was with me), I asked if he had any thing of that description to sell; he said he had, and opened the stable which we had not looked into - there were four nags, and one horse of rather the cart kind; I said they would not suit - we came out and asked if he had any thing of the cart kind, he said""No."" I then asked if that stable belonged to him, pointing to the one which we had looked into, he said""Yes."" I asked if there was not any cart horse there; he hesitated, and said no, only two colts that had never been shod, and a nag that belonged to a gentleman, and was rather lame. I said I sometimes bought colts, and asked if he could not shew them to me; he hesitated, and appeared conscious of what we were searching for. He unlocked the stable, I went in, and immediately said""Here is one that will suit me, and here is another, they are both stolen, and are my property."" Rice said he belonged to Union Hall, and must take him in charge; he said,""But you will give me a chance to get my money back, I will go and shew youthe man I received the horses from."" I gave the horses in care of my man. It is impossible he could mistake them for colts which had never been shod. He took us to a public-house at Paddington, the other prisoner came to the door; he pointed him out as the man who brought them to him - the officer said he apprehended him for felony; he scarcely said a word. We asked how he brought the horses into town, he gave no answer. Cutts was then very anxious to go home to change his clothes, and asked if we had not done with him - we took him to Union Hall, the Magistrate was not there. Hone was locked up, and Cutts taken to a public-house; a person came in and called him Cutts, before that, we understood his name to be Smith. They were afterwards examined, what they said was not taken down - no promise or threat were held out to them. Cutts said the horses were brought to his stable the night before (this was Saturday) by two strange men, that Home was one of them, that it was late at night, they could not go to a public-house, and they brought them to his stable, engaged it for the night, and brought a truss of hay for them. He said nothing about having bought them. Home said he came from Shropshire. The Magistrate asked what he had been doing lately; he hesitated, and at last said,""I acknowledge that I stole the horses."" The horses appeared to have been brought a considerable distance, they could scarcely walk, their feet were pared down, and could not walk on the road without pain.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How far is Godstone from town - A. Twenty-three miles. Paddington is about twenty-six miles from Godstone. I was directed to Cutt's stable as a horse dealer. I saw my horses by pulling the door a little open. None of the horses in the other stable were exactly of the cart breed, but one was rather heavy. He did not say they were not his; Home did not deny it. Cutts said""The men who brought them were entire strangers, I received the horses as if for sale."" JOHN RICE . I am an officer. I went with the prosecutors to several places, we came to No. 8, Wharf, Paddington, and found two stables locked - the one padlocked, was rather loose; I opened it a little, the prosecutors looked in, and knew one of the horses; I enquired whom the stables belonged to, and sent to the prisoner; I accosted him as Smith, and asked if the stable, No. 8, belonged to him, and said a friend of mine was waiting to buy a horse, if he had any for sale; he said he had, and came to the yard, and found the prosecutors there; we first went into a stable, where there were four nags, and one rather a heavy horse, the prosecutor said he wanted a horse that would work immediately; Cutts said that would suit him - the prosecutors declined, we asked if he had any more, he said,""No, no more mares in the cart way."" I pointed to the other door, and said,""Does this stable belong to you,"" he said it did; we asked if had anything in the cart way there; he said, No; there was nothing but one nag belonging to a gentleman, and two colts, they had never been shod yet. I asked if he had the key of that stable; he said he had - he hesitated, and at last opened it, the prosecutor went in, and said,""Here is two that will suit me;"" I said,""It is no use, Mr. Smith, going on any further, those two are stolen; I am an officer, and shall take you on suspicion of being concerned."" He was very much embarrassed, and said,""God bless me, I can shew you the man I had them of; give me an opportunity of getting my money back;"" I said I would give him every opportunity I could - they appeared like two cart mares; no one could mistake them for colts never shod. He talked very fast, and took us about three hundred yards, to a public-house, and Home came out, and stood still a moment, he said""That is the man that brought them to my stable;"" I said,""Young man, I charge you with horse stealing;"" he refused saying any thing about them, he only gave me his name, and Cutts gave me his name as William Smith , only. His wife came to him; he wanted to go home and change himself. Some conversation passed, he said""I may as well tell you,"" his wife said,""If you do not, I will;"" he then said a man came first of all, and engaged this stable for the mares; I asked who the other man was, he said,""Oh! Home can tell you,"" he afterwards said the man's name was Hunter; he did not know where he lived, but it was somewhere by Vauxhall-bridge, and that Hunter was the man he dealt with about them, and it should all come out, if the other man did not tell, but he knew as well as him. I took them to Union Hall, locked Home up, and took Smith to a public-house, a man came in, and addressed him as Cutts. They were examined in the evening, what Hone said was taken in writing, in the minute book, and the final examination was taken on paper. I have not the least doubt of it, the clerk was writing at the time.MR. GETTING. I applied for a copy of the examination, and stood by the clerk while he copied the deposition, and what the prisoner said was not taken down, for I saw the book, and expressly asked the clerk. I am sure the last examination was not taken down. JOHN RICE re-examined. I am speaking of the first examination. After the examination I enquired of the prisoner Home, about Hunter; he said the man who was with him, when he took the horses out of the field, he knew nothing of, nor his name, but that that man told him he knew a man in London, who wanted two horses, and persuaded him to take them from Getting's field. He always said he would give me every information he could.Cross-examined. Q. You enquired for Hunter - A. Yes. I went to Home in prison, and asked if he had seen any of the party who was with him when the horses were stolen, he said No, and if he could tell me where to find the man, he would, and if he came to see him, he would tell somebody. The mares feet appeared to be recently cut down. Cutts walked very slow towards the public-house. I have had information about another man, who has absconded. When Cutts came to Home, he did not say a word about his money.There being no evidence to prove Home was possessed of the property in the county of Middlesex. the prisoners were ACQUITTED .First Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice Burrough.",notGuilty,none

Next day, I went there again, Goff was to buy a 5 l. forged note. I gave her a sovereign; I searched her in the presence of her husband, to see that she had no other money or notes, she had none - she then went towards the Horseshoe, public-house, Goswell-street, with Dowling, Goff and I followed them and saw them go in; they might be there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, they came out together. We went to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, they followed us, Mrs. Goff gave me a 5 l. note (looks at one) this is it; I signed it at the time,""12th December, 1821."" I met her again on the 21st, at the Jacob's Wells, public-house, and searched her - she was to buy a 5 l. note of Job Jones; I gave her a sovereign, Goff, Lawrence, and I followed her to the Horseshoe, Dowling was not with her; she went into the Horseshoe, and came out alone in a few minutes; we returned to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, where she gave me a 5 l. note; (looks at one) this is it. On the 22d, I saw her again, at the Jacob's Wells, public-house, searched her as before, and gave her another sovereign. Goff and Lawrence, the constable, of Lambeth, were with me. We followed her, and saw her go into the Horseshoe, public-house, she came out in a few minutes in company with the prisoner; they went up Goswell-street, towards Seward-street, and there we lost sight of them - I do not know where they went. I returned to the Horseshoe, public-house. In about half an hour, I saw Mrs. Goff and the prisoner, they parted at the door of the Horseshoe, public-house, the prisoner went in, and Mrs. Goff came on to me; we went to the Edinburgh Castle, public-house, Sweeting's-alley, Cornhill, where she gave me a note, (looks at one), this is it; she wrote on it by my direction, and I put my name 22, 12, 21, on it; I saw her again on the 27th, about two o'clock, at the Jacob's Wells, public-house; Goff, Lawrence, and Welsh, were with me - I searched her, she had no money or note; I gave her a sovereign which I marked with a K, on the dragon side; her husband tore one of Hazard's lottery bills in two, and it was wrapped up in part of it - I kept the other piece; I only gave her one sovereign, which would buy one note; we all followed her, and saw her go into the Horseshoe; she came out in two or three minutes in company with the prisoner; they went up Goswell-street, we were at the Pitt's Head, at the corner of Old-street, Goff was with me; Lawrence, and Welsh, were to follow the prisoner; Mr. Goff, and Lawrence came and gave me information - I saw the prisoner and Mrs. Goff within three yards of the Pitt's Head,; I took him, and took him into the Pitt's Head, handcuffed him, and took him to the Crown, tavern, Clerkenwell, where Lawrence and Goff searched him; Goff said he had found the marked sovereign, and gave it me; I looked at it, and gave it him back; it was wrapped up in part of the lottery bill as before - Lawrence found a 5 l. note on him, I saw him take it from his right hand coat pocket, it appeared to be put in in a careless way; about 4 s. 6 d. in silver, and nine bad shillings wrapped up in paper, were also found on him, there was 3 s. or 4 s. in a row, wrapped in soft paper. Lawrence wrote on the note, and also myself, (looks at one) this is the note; I wrote 27, 12, 21 on it; he was asked how he came by the sovereign, he said he had had it above a fortnight, and took it for some poultry, and that he picked up the counterfeit shillings.

Q. Goff, his wife, and Dowling, planned the arrangement - A. Yes. I acted on Dowling's information; I have not seen her since the 14th of December, she had two guineas from Mrs. Goff and has absconded. I searched Goff as diligent as if I expected to find something, though I did not - I believe if she had a note concealed about her, I should have found it. The note found on the prisoner was rumpled. Dowling said this man was in the habit of supplying bad notes. GEORGE GOFF . I am a constable. I attended at the Jacob's Wells, public-house, on the 12th, 21st, 22d, and 27th of December, and was present when the money was delivered to my wife, and saw her go to the Horseshoe, public-house, and saw the prisoner. Kinsey's account is correct. I was present on the 27th, and assisted in taking the prisoner - I searched him at the Crown, tavern, and in his breeches pocket, I found 4 s. 6 d., and two halfpence; and in his coat pocket, I found two papers wrapped up, one contained a sovereign, marked K, it was wrapped in part of a lottery bill; the other paper contained nine counterfeit shillings - I questioned him about the sovereign; he said he had had it about a fortnight, and took it for some poultry; it was the same paper, and the same sovereign that was given to my wife. I asked his name, he said,""Some people called him John Tye , and some John Tee ."" I asked what he called himself; he said,""He was no scholar, and could not tell; that he lived somewhere near Winfield-street.Cross-examined. Q. You was present at the search of your wife - A. Yes; it was a diligent search with decency. The sovereign was found in his coat pocket, after he was handcuffed. I knew Dowling by her having business with my brother, who was an officer six or seven yearsago. I met her by chance one evening, and she enquired for my brother, and made this proposal to me - I mentioned it to Kinsey. I found the sovereign in his coat pocket, and the goods silver in his breeches pocket.MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. What did he say about the sovereign - A. I sounded it on the table, and asked how he came by it, he said, he had had it a fortnight. JOHN KINSEY re-examined.

Were you present when the prisoner was apprehended - A. Yes; he was handcuffed, and taken to the Crown, tavern, Clerkenwell; I found a 5 l. note, in his right hand pocket, and marked it, (looks at it), this is the same - I saw Goff take something out of his pocket, which he said was a sovereign. I was present when a sovereign was given to Mrs. Goff, wrapped in a piece of Hazard's lottery bill; that produced is the same, Kinsey gave it her.Cross-examined. Q. Where was the 5 l. note - A. In his jacket pocket, every thing but the good silver was there. THOMAS GLOVER . I am an inspector of Bank notes; I have been so upwards of twenty-seven years; (looks at one note, bought on the 27th), this is forged in all respects; it is signed""H. Whiting,"" but is not his hand writing - the others are all forged in every respect; also that found on the prisoner; they all appear from the same plate, and is a plate which has come to my knowledge within the last year.

I got the shopman to send for an officer, and I returned to my shop, I had left the prisoner in the care of my wife. Mr. White went with me and one of his partners; two young men came in, there were some persons round the door, but they did not appear to be concerned with the prisoner. I told the prisoner it was a forged note, he said it was not, that it were all right. I told him he should not leave the shop until I had ascertained the truth; Mr. White came in before I sent for the officer, he looked at the note, and said in the hearing of the prisoner, he was of opinion it was forged; he then left the shop. Plank and Wales came in, and the prisoner was searched; the note was examined by several persons, and the two young men looked at it, and White's partner looked at it, returned it me, and I gave it to Plank, after putting my initials upon it; (looking at it), this is the same note, there is R. W. on it. WILLIAM WHITE . I live next door to Mr. Wedgwood. I went into his shop and saw the prisoner; Mr. Wedgwood shewed me the note, I thought it bad, I returned the same note to him immediately. SAMUEL PLANK . I am an officer, of Marlborough-street. I went to Mr. Wedgwood's house, and took the prisoner into custody. Wales, a brother officer, was with me; Mr. Wedgwood delivered the note to me (looking at it), this is the same note, I got Mr. Wedgwood to mark it. I asked the prisoner to account how he came possessed of the note, he said he had it of Mr. Scott, No. 44, Bedford-square - that Mr. Scott directed him to go to a stationer's, on the left hand side of Oxford-street, to purchase a ream of gilt paper, and half a hundred of pens, and said his name was William Williams . I took the bill from him - I said I would detain him and ascertain thewhole account. I left him in the care of Wales, and went to No. 44, Bedford-square, which was occupied by a Mr. Ward, whose name was on the door. No person of the name of Scott was in the house; there is a Dr. Scott, who lived in the square, at the corner of Gower-street. I returned to the office, and told the prisoner I could not find any such person as he described - I desired him to write the name and place; he began to write, but being flurried, he desired me to write it, and he would sign it. I wrote down what he desired, and he signed it, (read)""1st of December, 1821. I received the 10 l. note, this evening, from Mr. Scott, No. 44, Bedford-square; I went there with a pair of shoes for a shoemaker, in Holborn, and Mr. Scott requested me to go to the shop in Oxford-street, and fetch one ream of gilt paper, and half a hundred of pens."" I offered to go with him to where he lived, or else to the square, to Mr. Scott, he said,""All I have told you, is false."" I took him to the watch-house; he said he would tell me who he had the note of; that he had it of a man known by the name of John, that they were together at the Horseshoe, public-house, in Goswell-street, that evening - they came out together, and John gave him the 10 l. note. They walked into Oxford-street, and he directed him to go into Mr. Wedgwood's, and buy a ream of paper and half a hundred of pens, and say he came from Mr. Scott, Bedford-square; and that they were to divide the change, if they were successful in passing the note. That the man who gave it him, came into the shop, and Mr. Wedgwood turned him out; and that they lodged together, at No. 1, Bell-alley, Goswell-street, close to the Horseshoe, public-house. Early on Sunday morning, Wales and I went there, and found John in bed, he was examined, and finally discharged. JOHN WALES . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I was with Plank, his account is correct in every respect. I saw the prisoner sign the paper, he did it voluntarily - he began to write it himself, but being agitated, he desired Plank to write it, which he did, and read it over to him, he said it was true; and signed his name, W. Williams. We both offered to go to the place he mentioned, he refused to go, and said, what he had said was false, and he would tell the truth. ALLEN ANSCOMB . I live with Mr. Ward, No. 44, Bedford-square, and have lived there six years. No Scott lived there - I know nothing of the prisoner. JOSEPH BOWEN . I am a stationer, and live in Oxford-street.

He said, making a sign with his hand,""You will send them round to me, at Mr. Outram's."" Dr. Outram's house is in George-street, Hanover-square, just behind me, he lives at the corner house; he pointed towards Dr. Outram's. I made him a bill, it came to 25 s., he was going out; he then turned back and said, he might as well pay for them, as perhaps he should not be at home when they came - he then tendered me a 10 s. note; I found I had not sufficient change by 3 l. I went to different neighbours, who could not change it. I asked Mr. Roberts for change, and gave the same note to him, he went to Mr. Shaw's, next door to get it changed. I stood at Mr. Robert's door, he returned, and gave me ten sovereigns. I went back and found the prisoner in the shop, I could then give him but 8 l. 12 s.; I told him I was still 3 s. short of change; he said""Never mind, tell the boy to give it to the servant, when you send the goods, and he will give it to me."" I said I was much obliged to him, and went to the door with him. He turned towards Dr. Outram's and went away; I sent the goods to Dr. Outram's, half an hour after, with 3 s. wrapped in paper, and in a quarter of an hour after, the Drs. servant returned the goods to me - the prisoner never called for them. About a fortnight after, I heard what had happened at Wedgwood's, I went there, saw the prisoner in the shop, and knew him. WILLIAM ROBERTS . I keep a feather shop, in Oxford-street.

I told him to come into the shop for his change; I marked the note, (looks at one), this is it, it has Adams, Compton-street; I suspected the note, and told him that if two which I had returned to me before were bad, this was a bad one also; he said that was his master's, and where he lived it was written on the order, Adams, No. 32, Compton-street; he said he lived errand boy with him. I sent for an officer; he was searched and a few shillings found on him. I enquired at Compton-street, but no such person was to be found. WILLIAM COOK . I am an officer of Farringdon Ward.

How did you get in - A. A young woman went up, and said to the child,""Edward, your mother is come after you;"" I immediately went into the room; the young woman went out of the room when I went in - I spoke first, I believe; I asked what business he had to harbour my child from his school; he told me not to come and kick up any riot in his apartment; I said I would not trouble him if he let me and my children alone - he asked if I came to expose him, I said I did; he told me two or three times to go out of his room; I said I would not, till I had an officer to take him up, to bring him to justice - he called me a prostitute; I said,""I was none, till he made me one."" He turned round to his seat, and stooped, but what he got from there, I cannot say. When he first got up, he had been sitting at the dinner table. I do not know any thing that passed afterwards, but we were on the stairs together, and I felt myself stabbed.Q. When he turned round to his seat what did he do - A. He took something from his seat, but I cannot say what; he came towards me, I ran towards the stairs, and do not recollect any thing that passed afterwards, but I felt myself stabbed, and him over me; I do not know whether I fell, or whether he pushed me - my own children was close to me, and so was his daughter; I said I was stabbed, and the children screamed Murder!

Here are the stays which I wore at the time; there is blood on them, and two holes. When I was on the stairs, I felt myself stabbed, and said I was stabbed.Q. Before this, there was a pretty loud quarrel between you - A. Yes. I did not strike him, or throw any thing at him; I said I would have him tried for bigamy, and would not go till I had brought him to justice; I stamped and raged a good deal, and refused to leave the room, when he told me - I believe I aggravated him; I was very passionate, and aggravated him as much as I could. I reproached him for having other wives, and told him he wished to bring my two boys up as thieves; he was very passionate as well as I. THOMAS LEE . I am son-in-law of the prisoner's landlord.

I was sitting below; there was a disturbance up in the prisoner's room, like people quarrelling, only a general noise - I heard stamping with feet; I could not tell whether it came from one or more persons; then I heard something like a falling down stairs - I ran up, and saw them laying in the landing, at the bottom of the stairs; I thought they was fighting - I tried to part them, and in doing so, I saw the prisoner had a knife in his hand; I seized his arm, and took it from him, and immediately threw it into the one pair back room, and pushed him up stairs, and told him to govern his passion; I did not know that he had stabbed her - he went up and I followed him; he said,""What am I to do,"" I left him, and came down, and heard she was stabbed.

I took his apron off, which had a great deal of blood on it, but the blood did not come from the prosecutrix, as the daughter said she got before him, and was cut herself. WILLIAM MARKHAM . I am apprentice to Mr. Skinner, an apothecary and man-midwife; he is now at a labour. he dressed the woman's wounds.The prisoner put in a long written defence, stating, that the prosecutrix had refused to live with him; he had done his best to support her and the children; that he and his former wife parted by mutual consent.""The boy came to my lodging, and said his mother kept him from school, as hewas ill. She came in and abused me for encouraging him. I thought it a planned thing between them, and told her to leave the room; she threatened me with transportation, and shook her fist at me; her language irritated my blood.

t18220109-34,kill,murder,uncategorized,none,18220109,"DANIEL MAHONEY was indicted for the wilful murder of Richard Needs .MR. ROBERT HANSON. I am a pupil at the London Hospital. I saw the deceased directly he was brought into the hospital, he had a fracture on the scull on the front of the head; we examined him carefully, but did not discover the fracture till two or three days after, but observed a considerable laceration on the head; he did not appear to be under the apprehension of death, a mere fracture in the scull does not always produce death, this fracture was not calculated to produce death - he died early in December, having come in on the 13th of November.Q. Of what did he die - A. Of an inflammation on the lungs, we opened him, apparently he had been subject to that complaint, but I have no doubt but that the exciting cause of the inflammation was the fracture on the head.COURT. Q. Will you explain that - A. Many external violences affect the lungs, they had been previously afflicted, without doubt; the fracture was remotely the cause - he would have died of the fracture, had he not died of the inflammation. I say so from the observation I made on opening the body.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you mean to say the fracture of the scull, was certainly the cause; for instance, if the fracture was shewn to you, would you say of course, that he must die - A. No; there was a separation of the membrane of the brain when we opened him, which was sufficient to cause his death - he laboured under two diseases, the inflammation caused his death - I cannot say whether it existed before the wound or not. It might have been of much longer standing than the wound. THOMAS STAGG . I keep the Green Man, public-house, in Castle-street, Whitechapel. I knew the deceased, Richard Needs . On the 12th of November, the prisoner and him were at my house, after twelve o'clock at night. I let the prisoner and three others in; the deceased came in about ten minutes after - he and the prisoner had a few words, the prisoner said""Dick, don't you remember giving me a slap in the face, when I did not deserve it? the deceased said""Don't bear malice, forget that,"" they drank together, and then the prisoner said,""Dick, look out for yourself, for I shall look out for you."" Nothing else passed in my hearing; they left the house directly after, within three minutes of each other; they were not intoxicated - the four who came in had two pots of beer, and Dick drank with them, and he had a companion - I do not know whether he drank.Cross-examined. Q. Where did the deceased come from - A. From a club; a man came in with him, and three or four followed. Stubbs and Haines were two of them; the prisoner called for the beer, and asked Needs to drink; Needs did not first speak of the quarrel.Q. Had the quarrel happened at your house - A. Yes; seventeen months before - nobody endeavoured to keep the prisoner in the room to fight, there was no scuffle - I cannot say which went out first.COURT. Q. Are you sure the beginning of it was the prisoner asking if he remembered giving him a slap - A. Yes; he said,""Look out for yourself,"" it was not said in an angry way, he did not explain what he meant. I do not know that. I had seen them together after the quarrel. Needs was a lamplighter, and lived in Essex-street, Whitechapel - the prisoner worked at a gas factory, in Goldston-street, and lived in Castle-street, near Essex-street. GEORGE STUBBS . I am a bricklayer. I knew Needs. On the 12th of November, I was with him; we came from a club together, we and the patrol Sanson went into the Green Man, public-house, about half past eleven o'clock. When we first went in, I saw three Irishmen standing by the door, with a pot of porter in their hands - one of the three spoke to the deceased, and calling him out, asked him to drink with them. One of the Irishmen said,""Do you remember a quarrel which ensued,"" or something of that sort; the deceased said,""I hope you will think nothing of that,"" the other said,""Look out for yourself;"" he then left, and I asked one of them to drink. Needs went up stairs, I stopped at the bar door talking, I was in the house three quarters of an hour altogether. I was there a very little time after these words passed. Needs went out before me, I did not see any of them go out.Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Needs come down? - A. No; there were four or five Englishmen, Needs drank with the prisoner. JOSEPH HAINES . I am a costermonger. On the night of the 12th of November, I was in Castle-street, Whitechapel, about one o'clock in the morning; and saw theprisoner in the passage of the Green Man, public-house, with a pot of beer in his hand, drinking with another; the prisoner and Needs had some conversation together, I do not know what it was; the prisoner went out with his partner. Needs went out in about half a minute, alone, I and Francis came out of the public-house together after Needs went out, and saw him about twenty-five yards from us, the prisoner and the other man were before him. We saw Needs fall, and the other two run away - at this time, they were not above two yards from him. We pursued them, and sung out Watch! and Murder! he did not overtake them, and returned to Needs, who was with the watchmen, they held him up as well as they could. I went home with him to Catharine Wheel-alley, he was cut on the side of the head and bled very much, I cut the hair off his head, I got a plaster, put it on, and went away; he was taken to the Hospital the next day.Cross-examined. Q. You and Francis were the nearest to him when he fell - Yes; it was a moonlight night. When the alarm was made, three or four more came out of the public-house. The prisoner went out first, and Needs after him, he was going the nearest way home - Catharine Wheel-alley, where he lives, is near Essex-street. JAMES FRANCIS . I am a shoe-maker. I lived in the same house as Need's, No. 24, Catharine Wheel-alley. I was with Hains on the 12th of November in Castle-street, near the Green Man, public-house, in the street, about seven or eight yards from the prisoner; I heard him say,""Dick come along,"" a man was with the prisoner. Needs went on following him about forty yards behind in the middle of the street, and they walked by the side of the houses, and when they got to the bottom of the street, I saw Needs fall, the prisoner and his friend were about ten yards from Needs when he fell, and I about twenty yards behind. I ran as hard as I could to have the prisoner and his companion stopped, as they ran off directly; I called, Watch! and Haines called out, Watch and Murder! he was behind me, but did not overtake them, I returned to where the deceased fell, he had been taken away. I saw him at his own house about five minutes after, sitting in a chair between two other men bleeding at the head.Cross-examined. Q. You lived in the same house - A. Yes; since April, I do not know whether he ever saw Needs; Needs had had a very bad cough for twelve months, but sometimes he was quite hearty.Q. How came Needs to go out after the prisoner - A. We were all going home; I did not tell him to follow Mahoney; he said,""Dick come along,"" they walked about forty yards before he fell.MR. HARRISON re-examined. He only had one blow, that certainly might be occasioned by a fall on the curb-stone, as well as a blow from a stone. JOHN PARTRIDGE . I am the night-beadle, of Whitechapel. On the morning of the 13th, about four o'clock, I went to the prisoner's lodgings and took him to the deceased's lodging. I found him in bed, he lived about one hundred and fifty yards from the deceased. I took him into Need's presence, there was five or six persons in the room; I told the deceased to look round to see if he saw the person, he said,""That is the man"" nodding at Mahoney, the prisoner muttered something to this effect;""If I have thrown it I am sorry for it;"" I took him immediately to the watch-house. On Sunday, the 9th of December, I saw Needs about four o'clock in the afternoon, he died between six and seven o'clock that night. I cannot say he was aware that he was dying. THOMAS YEARLING . I am a watchman. On the night of the 12th of November, I was in Castle-street, Whitechapel. I saw the deceased in the court about twenty minutes before two, and heard a voice say,""Needs, come this way,"" Needs went forward, and I followed him about sixteen yards off, and I saw him suddenly fall - I sprang my rattle, I saw nobody before him, it was moonlight and foggy, I noticed nothing before I heard the voice calling him, I heard nothing called out, I returned to the deceased and found him in the hands of a young man who was endeavouring to get him on his feet, he laid on his left side, and his head was cut. I carried him to his own house, returned and found this stone about seven yards from where he fell, this was half or three quarters of an hour after, there was no other stone except a large granite stone, nearly as big as a hat, on the other side of the road.Cross-examined. Q. Had you a lantern - A. Yes.COURT. Q. Is there a foot pavement - A. Yes, my Lord; the deceased fell in the kennel nearly in the middle of the street, there is a dust heap between where he fell and the Green Man public-house. JOAN SANSOM . I am patrol of White-chapel. About half past two o'clock in the morning of the 13th of November this hat was given to me in Catharine Wheel-alley, exactly in the state it is now. I went with Partridge when the deceased and prisoner were together, Partridge said,""Look round Dick and see if the man is in the room, who threw the stone at you,"" he rose his head as well as he could, and said,""That is the man,"" nodding to Mahoney, we took him to the watch house. SAMUEL NEEDS . I am brother to the deceased. I know this hat was my brother's; I cannot say that he wore it on the night in question, but he generally wore it. FREDERICK AGER . I am a surgeon. On the 13th of November, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the deceased, he was then considerably recovered, and in a perfectly sensible state - he had a wound on the left side of the head; I cannot say whether it was inflicted by a blunt instrument, or by a fall. I examined it with a probe, but did not discover it to be fractured. I think the wound might be inflicted by the stone produced.Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; I do not know any thing about the man. THOMAS YEARLING re-examined. The deceased went ten yards before he fell - I heard a voice say""Needs, come along this way,"" he fell in less than a minute; he had got a good way beyond the dust heap, if there was a man before him, he must be further from the dust heap.

I am a watchman of Mary-le-bone parish. I was in the Edgware-road when the accidenthappened. I was coming down the road from John-street, towards Tyburn-turnpike, about half-past nine o'clock, and passed by a gig, which was alongside of the curb-stone on the left; the horse's head was towards Tyburn-gate. A gentleman was standing alongside his horses on the left hand on the near side. I passed by about twenty yards, and heard the smacking of a whip behind, and instantly heard a crash; I turned round, and went to the spot. I saw a coach lying on its side, four or five doors from Queen-street, in the Edgware-road; the horses laid down on their sides. I held my lantern while a gentleman was dragged from under the fore part of the coach; the chaise-horse was running away, and the chaise tumbling to pieces. A woman was picked up, who I knew by seeing her frequently on my beat. The coachman called for help, and turned the coach on the wheels, got his horses up, and led them; it was a dark night. I cannot say who the coachman was. The road was lighted by oil on the side the gig stood, and it was just by a lamp.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The road was only lit on one side - A. No; the gig almost touched the curb; I suppose the coach occasioned the crash. I found it two yards from where I saw the gig; it laid more over in the road on the right. I did not see the coach before the accident happened.COURT. Q. Did the man who led the horses take any notice of Mr. Slade - A. No; he led his horses away, and took no notice. THOMAS ESTE , ESQ. I live at Portland-place. I was in the Edgware-road; there were two women looking at some jewellery in a shop; a person inside came to the door; the women ran from the shop towards Paddington; they were hailed by a coachman on his box, who asked them to come up, using very coarse language at the time. He handed one up on the box, the other got on the roof behind the box; the coachman drove off rather rapidly till he came close to the turnpike, and having cleared the gate, he drove off very rapidly; I heard screams almost immediately after he cleared the gate. I returned to the spot, and saw the woman who had got on the box, fainting on the ground; she was supported by some person. On my asking what had happened, a boy held up the wing of a gig; I then saw a gentleman leaning against the rails, two doors beyond where the women were - he was in great agony, and could scarcely speak. I advised his being taken in doors, and he was taken in. I then saw the body of the gig nearly opposite, at the top of George-street; it was shattered to pieces. The gig-horse was brought back. Just as I was leaving the pavement to ascertain the name on the coach, the coachman drove off full gallop. I do not know him; I think he saw me, and whipped his horses. I could discern the words Notting-hill, on the front pannel, on the near side of the road, coming from Paddington. It was a fine night for the time of the years. If I had been driving to town, I could certainly see any other vehicle on the road with great ease.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The gig was on the proper side, and the coach going in the direction it did, was on the right side also - A. Yes; he only trotted to the turnpike. I guess that he went faster afterwards by hearing of the chain of the coach, but I did not see it. It may be that the coach came suddenly on the gig, and could not turn, but had it gone at a proper pace, there was space enough to turn, and he might have pulled up - the remains of the gig were two hundred yards from the turnpike. I am certain that he quickened his pace on getting through the turnpike. WILLIAM GOSLING . I am a bookseller, and live in the Edgware-road. On the 29th of November, about nine o'clock in the evening, I heard a sudden crash opposite my door. I went out, and saw a person standing on the flag, in great agitation; he appeared very much hurt. I picked up a female who was laying on the ground, and in the interval, Mr. Slade was taken into my room. Some persons were lifting the coach on its wheels, but I cannot identify the coachman. I did not see what coach it was; it was not a dark night. DAVID GRIFFITHS . I am a carpenter, and live in the Edgware-road. I remember this accident, the first thing I saw was the deceased sitting on a chair; the person hurt was brought into the house in which I live - I ascertained that it was Mr. Slade, of Tottenham Court-road; Mr. Bryan, the surgeon's young man came - I saw a coach in the road, I knew it to be the Bayswater, by the colour of the body; Paddington was written on it; I did not look for the word Bayswater, as I only knew one coach of that colour. Mr. Slade left my house in a coach with one of Mr. Bryan's young men. When I saw the coach, it stood between two lamps, about seven yards from each. I do not know who drove. RICHARD SAUNDERS . I am a wheelwright, and live in the Edgware-road. I remember the accident happening; I heard a noise, and went to my gate, and saw a stage coach. Mr. Slade was standing against the rails; it was a Bayswater coach; the prisoner was leading the horses; I have seen him drive the same coach before, nobody but him was with it. I did not see it go away.Cross-examined. Q. Then how did he lead the horses - A. He just straightened them, they were fastened to the coach. I saw him drive that coach the day before, and at other times. After he straightened the horses he came up, and said,""Are the women,"" or""Are the ladies hurt."" CAROLINE JOHNSON . I recollect the accident. I know the prisoner, he is a coachman - I was an outside passenger from the Star and Garter, public-house, to Bayswater, he drove the coach - I was on the roof. When he got through the turnpike he stopped the coach to put down a passenger, or to do something to the coach; I did not see any one get out; he got off the coach and gave me the reins to hold, as he was getting up again, I had the reins in my hand, the horses moved, and I dropped them; he got up, and tried to recover the reins but could not - he was on the box when the accident happened; I was so frightened that I held on the coach, and cannot say whether he had the reins or not, he stooped down towards the horses' backs to get them, but whether he did or not, I cannot say; I was thrown off, and fainted away, and saw part of the chaise, after I recovered; the coach was going fast. I was going to Bayswater.Q. To whom were you going there - A. To no one in particular; it was about nine o'clock. I live in Lisson-street, Paddington.Cross-examined. Q. Did the horses go on fast - A. Yes; I tried to save myself. The coach was upset before I could see whether he had the reins or not - I let them drop, and the horses plunged forwards directly.COURT. Q. Had he hold of the reins when the horses first set off in a gallop - A. No; I dropped the reins before he got up, as he was getting up. RICHARD HACON . I am assistant to a surgeon, and live in Princes-street, Hanover-square. I was in the Edgware-road, and saw Mr. Slade after the accident, at his house in Tottenham Court-road; I also saw him at Mr. Griffiths's house. I did not assist in dressing his wound.MR. R. C. GRIFFITHS. I am a surgeon, and live in Tottenham Court-road. I knew Mr. Abraham Slade ; I was sent for to him on the 29th of November, at ten o'clock at night - he had a severe injury on the knee, and bruises on the angle of the jaw, back, and loins, occasioned by extensive violence; the effect of that injury, but more particularly the injury of the knee, occasioned his death; it mortified, he died in thirteen days - I attended him with Sir Ashley Cooper, I saw him every day; every thing was done for him that could be. I conceived him to be in danger from the first moment I saw him; I saw death approaching on the Monday, he died on Wednesday. He felt convinced he should not recover from the first, he said from the beginning, and also on the Monday before his death, that he was sure he should die; he always expressed himself as having no hope of recovery.MR. BRODRICK. Q. He was sometimes better, and sometimes worse - A. Yes.COURT. Q. When did you hear him say any thing about what happened - A. Soon after it happened; he did not believe himself in the article of death; we had not told him that he was in danger. DANIEL EDWARD STEVENS . I live in Escott-place. I am clerk to Mr. Young, solicitor, of Poland-street, Hampstead; I knew Mr. Abraham Slade , of Tottenham Court-road. On the 30th of November, I was sent for to him, and saw him in bed; he said,""I am dreadfully wounded, and do not expect to live, and wish to make my will.""MR. BRODRICK to MR. GRIFFITHS. Q. During the attendance of Sir Ashley Cooper, and yourself, you had great difficulty in keeping up his spirits, I suppose you told him not to be alarmed - A. We encouraged him to hope, and said it was possible and propable that he might recover; this excited his hopes a little, but he never expressed satisfied that he should live; his spirits were not so much depressed; after we gave him hopes, he was certainly not under the apprehension of immediate death.COURT. Q. Then when he had the conversation with you, it was possible he might recover - A. We had hopes of his recovery till Monday.The Court considered that there was not sufficient proof of the deceased's conviction of his death, to receive in evidence any declaration made by him. WILLIAM JONES re-examined. The first thing I heard, was the smacking of a whip behind me, the Tyburn gate was behind me; I believe the smacking came from towards the toll bar; I returned immediately, and saw Mr. Slade taken from under the coach. The crash was not more than two minutes after the smacking of the whip.GUILTY. Aged 19.Of Manslaughter only .

Bank note , his property. JOHN GODDARD . I rent a house in Orchard-street, St. Margaret's, Westminster. Jane Allen lodges with me. On Sunday, the 23d of November, my wife and son went to church, and about half-past eleven o'clock, I and my youngest son left home to go to church also. We occupy one room up stairs, and one below. I locked the door of the room where all this property was, and put the key in my pocket. The window is about four feet from the ground. Only one pane at the top opens to admit the air; that was also shut. I do not know whether I left any body in the house. I came home first, about one o'clock, and found the room-door open. A drawer was open, which was shut when I went out. The bolt of the lock stood out. I found an eight-day clock taken off the bracket, but not taken out of the room. The cupboard doors, where I had locked the property, were wide open. I missed twelve sovereigns, one guinea, with the impression nearly worn off, a 1 l. note, 4 l. in silver, and 30 s. in copper. The silver was in one green baize bag, and the gold and note in another; the copper was tied in 5 s. papers, with packthread round them. I alarmed the house - Mrs. Allen came down with several other lodgers. I went with Cooper, the officer, to the Rising Sun, public-house, Bedfordbury, about four o'clock, and waited there; the prisoner came in about a quarter before five; Cooper took him, and found the green bag, which had contained the silver, on him - there were nine sovereigns, the smooth guinea, one 1 l. note, and 4 l. in silver, in it. I knew the guinea and the note - it had my own writing on it;""Nesbitt, 33, Oxford-street,"" was on it. The prisoner had lodged with me for two years; we were intimate; his father lodged with me before that time. He had been in my room about nine or ten o'clock on the Saturday night, and at that time, I had three sovereigns and the guinea in a glass on the mantle piece. JANE ALLEN . I lodged at the prosecutor's. On Sunday the 23d of December I was at home all day with my husband. I went down stairs about eleven o'clock, and was called down again at one. I went at eleven o'clock to make the prisoner's bed, but he was not up; he lodged on the first floor, and is a locksmith. I made his bed at twelve o'clock; he was gone out then. He had locked his door, and put the key under the mat. JOSEPH COOPER . I am an officer of Queen-square. Goddard came to me; I went with him to the Rising Sun public-house, Bedfordbury; the prisoner came in at a quarter before five o'clock; I took him. On our way to the watch-house, I asked him where he had been since he lefthome; he said, in the Park. I asked who he joined in the Park; he said, Nobody. I asked where he had dined; he said, he did not know that he had dined any where. I asked whether he had any more money in his pocket than he could account for; he said, No. Upon searching him, I found a green baize bag, containing nine sovereigns, a smooth guinea, 4 l. in silver, and a 1 l. note; and in his pocket, 17 s. more. I undressed him to search him, and asked if he could account how he got it; he said, Yes. I took him into another room, and then he said he picked it up in the bag in the passage, as he was going out, between eleven and twelve o'clock. I again asked him where he had dined; he at last said he had dined with a man named Johnson, but declined telling me where he lived. I found two keys on him, one of which opens the door of his own room. EDWARD JOHN HANDLEY . I was with Cooper; I know nothing more. JOHN GODDARD . Here is my writing on the note.

JAMES OTHERLY . I am employed by the Gas Company. The property was found at my house, in Mulberry-place, Upper Charles-street; it was brought to me in the space of a year and half, by the prisoner, at different times, he gave them to me. I had known him two years and three quarters, and knew he lived with the prosecutors - he asked if I was married, I said Yes; he said if he thought so, he would make me a present towards housekeeping - he said he was in the habit of having small presents from different manufacturers, who supplied his master.Cross-examined by MR.

Mr. Palmer, junior, was examined, and said he sold the prisoner some things which he had brought me - I did not think them stolen. WILLIAM BRAND . I am a marshalman. I went to Otherly's, on the 1st of January, with Mr. Burnell, and found two quart decanters, six tumblers, five wine glasses, four salts and stands, all cut glass; two cruets, two pair of cups, with silver tops, six china cups and saucers, which the prosecutors claimed - they were on a sideboard.

Did not young Mr. Palmer say he sold him some of them - A. He identified some small articles, as having sold them to him - Otherly was kept in custody three or four days. JOHN FLETCHER LAWSON PALMER . I am book-keeper to Messrs. Burnell and Palmer. I only know that the articles are the property of the prosecutors.

Then he is charged in your books for them - A. No; I never entered them - the prosecutors were not aware of it; it was an account between me and him, some of them were sold twelve months ago.COURT. Q. Did you ever tell your masters, that you sold him the things - A. I do not recollect mentioning it. I intended him to pay for them - I did not enter it in any book, and cannot tell what he owed; the decanters produced, are a different sort to those I sold him, they had rings round the necks - I believe I never sold him those, I will not swear it, I positively swear I never sold him the decanters.MR. ANDREWS. Q. You swear it - A. Yes; these are cut glass - I entered some things on a slip of paper twelve months ago, (producing it) they were sold at three different times within twelve months - I have put no dates to it, I speak from my memory, that they were ring decanters. I have frequently sold things, and not entered them but when I receive the money, I give credit for it - if they are bought on credit, I enter them, but if paid for, I enter the money.Q. Why not enter Capper's - A. They ought to have been weighed, to ascertain the price, which I had not time to do, it was inconvenient - I cannot say these were ever the prosecutor's property, or if they were, that they were never sold.COURT. Q. You sold them to him at three different times; do you mean to say, that this memorandum was written at three different times - A. Yes; I kept the memorandum in my desk a long time, and then loose in my pocket - the first entry was made about four months after the second. ELIZA WATERFIELD .

I returned next morning about eleven o'clock, I had left all this property safe, I found the first and second floor broke open, there was no violence used to the front door - I was not the first that came to the house. FRANCIS LARUE . I am servant to the prosecutor. I went to the house about half-past six o'clock on the morning of the 26th, as usual - I was not there the day before, I found the street door a-jar, and all the flats in which the butter and things were, had been moved from where I left them on the 24th, they were out of their place nobody was in the house, I got a light and lit the gas, I missed two turkeys off the scale beam and some hams, they were safe at twelve o'clock on the night of the 24th.

I apprehended the prisoner at the corner of Chiswell-street, Finsbury-square, at half-past eight o'clock on the night of Christmas-day; he had a basket with two hams in it. I asked how he came by them; he said he brought them from Mr. Simpson's, Royal Exchange; and I believe he said Simpson was a tailor. I asked where he was going to take them; he said to Mrs. Armstrong, No. 29, St. John's-square, Clerkenwell, and that he lived there. I took him to the public-house; I detained him, and sent Bridges to Simpson, and next morning I went to No. 29, St. John's-square. His mother worked there, but did not live there; it is a sash-maker's; Mr. Younger claimed the basket. I found a watch on him, but it was not the prosecutor's. I took him to the watch-house, and sent Bridges back to the public-house, to search the spot where he stood; there were other people in the house, but we had him close under the window, in a corner opposite the bar. I asked where he lived; he then said at No. 10, Aylesbury-street. I found his mother lived there, but not him; he afterwards said he lived on Addle-hill, which I found true.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How far is the public-house from the watch-house - A. About one hundred and forty yards. He said he lived in John-street; not that he was going to his mother's there; he had a handkerchief over the hams. SAMUEL BRIDGES . I was with Garton when the prisoner was taken; his account is true in every point. I went back to the public-house, and in the corner where the prisoner stood, I found a crow-bar. I went next morning to Younger's - the place was in great confusion. I matched the crow-bar to the first floor door - it corresponded with both ends of it, and also with the marks on the secretarie. I found the second floor door was burst open by the same instrument - it fitted exactly - and also with a trunk which was broken open.Cross-examined. Q. This is a common turn-screw - A. It will do for that; it was all over ham-grease, and smell of ham. CHARLES STAPLES . I live in Little Bell-alley, four hundred yards from Younger's house. On Christmas night, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner, I am sure of him, his back was against Mr. Younger's door, he seemed to be looking at the opposite house; I then saw another man about a yard from him - I turned the corner about a dozen yards, and then returned to Younger's door; the prisoner then moved, and nudged the other; they went towards Angel-court - I went with my wife to Southwark-bridge; then returned, thinking something was going on a miss in the neighbourhood. I tried the door of the opposite house, it was safe; I went away, the party was gone - next morning I heard of the robbery; I said I should know one of the men, and hearing a man was in custody, I went to Worship-street, and saw the prisoner at the bar with another man, I knew him immediately, and swear positively to him; I should know the other if I saw him; there was two gas lamps within thirty yards, which both give strong lights - I looked him full in the face; he was looking up at the house, so that I saw his countenance plainly. I am confident of him.Cross-examined. Q. What time was it - A. About eight o'clock, he had his hat on. One gas light was about twelve yards from him. I am an officer, and have been so seven years.MR. YOUNGER. The basket is one I left in the house, my initials are on it, in my own writing, and I believe the hams to be mine. I should think it would take one man five journies to take them all.Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman says another prisonerwas at Worship-street with me, I was at the bar alone.

Between breakfast and dinner, Wilson and Tufnel came again to our house, Deakin was not at home when they came in, only myself, Wilson said to me,""Well, old woman, where is Deakin.""

Wilson said,""More fool he to be low, for I have seen a sufficient person in town on Monday, who said, if he would keep his own counsel and not tell of us, they cannot hurt a hair of his head;"" he said, he supposed he must have a Counsellor. I said, Yes, I dare say he must; he said, he would get him one, and that neither me nor my two children should want.

I saw Wilson again at my master's house, in the tap-room a few days after - I knew him again, as the man who brought the sack. Deakin was then in custody.Cross-examined. Q.

He sent me to Deakin's with the horse and cart on a Friday, about two months ago; it was a good while before I heard of the robbery - I went to Deakin's in the morning, and took something in a bag in the cart; he got in with me, we went down White Hart-lane, and I saw both the prisoners in the lane, one was in a field, and the other sitting on the stile; I did not know them before, they did not speak to Deakin; Deakin left me in White Hart-lane, and took the bag, cart and all, and returned with the cart empty - I saw the prisoners again, as we returned lower down the lane; Deakin got out and spoke to them, I do not know what he said; they talked together about five minutes, Deakin went with Wilson up a little bit of a lane, leaving Tufnel, they had nothing with them then, they came back to the cart in a little while, and brought something in a bag. Wilson brought it, and put it in the cart, without either of them saying a word; Tufnel stood ten ortwelve yards from the cart; I drove on; Deakin walked with them behind the cart, in conversation, not far up the lane; then the prisoners went back, and Deakin came on with me. I drove to Deakin's house, the bag was taken out, and carried into his house; Mrs. Deakin was there - I went home.Cross-examined. Q. You never saw them before - A. No. It was broad day light; I had heard of no robbery then, it was on a Friday a good while ago.Q. When did you first say you knew those men - A. Before the Magistrate at Edmonton, I believe it was on the 1st of January, I know them by their faces; I noticed them very much, and am sure of them; I never said I was not certain, I never doubted it. I am thirteen years old. EDWARD BROWN . I live at Palmer's-green. I did not marry Bonner's mother, her mother is my housekeeper. I remember Deakin's being taken up; Bonner was at my house after that, Wilson came there on the Wednesday after Deakin was taken; I was sitting at breakfast, Bonner was there, and a man who is in the country; Wilson said to Bonner,""How are you,"" she said,""I am middling,""""How is Deakin,"" said he, she said,""He is middling according to the place he is in."" he said,""Don't make yourself uneasy about him, for I have been to a good sufficient person in town, and he says they can't hurt a hair of his head if he does but keep his own counsel,"" I said,""Then I suppose you are one of the men who got these things,"" he said,""Yes,"" I said,""You have taken a mortal trouble to get these things, you broke a good many locks,"" he said,""Oh, that be d - d, that is all lies, we got them in an out place."" I went away, and left them there. JOSEPH GIBSON . I am a constable. I took Wilson in custody. As we went to prison, he said voluntarily in the office after the examination, that no one could hurt him but the woman, meaning Bonner; he said it was dark, and how could she see him, she had appeared against him. As we came to Newgate, he said,""I know I shall go into them cells."" When Tufnel was in the cage, at Lower Edmonton, he voluntarily said,""I am the fellow who broke the locks, and I had a good swig at the cream;"" he was talking to a person who gave him some beer. I overheard the conversation.Cross-examined. Q. You were outside the cage - A. Yes. I heard the words distinctly; I never heard him say the woman was a liar, and she would never be believed. THOMAS AUSTIN . I went with a search warrant to Deakin's house, and found a pair of wet stockings on a line, and a bundle of wet linen, under some sacks in the chamber; I produced them on Deakin's trial; they were given up to Mr. Ray. JULIA BRAMHALL re-examined. The dairy is near the laundry, there was milk and cream there, the milk was thrown about, and had been taken off the shelf; some cream had been taken off, ready for churning - there is sometimes a dozen pans of cream; I cannot say whether it was disturbed. Here is the property which was produced last Sessions; they are my master's, the marks of some are cut off, and the marks of some stockings are picked out; the mark of the red cotton still remains.(Property produced and sworn to.)WILSON'S Defence. Gibson has sworn false.TUFNEL'S Defence. There is a witness who saw Wilson at the Angel tap; Deakin and this woman came in with the property they asked him to drink. I wish Austin to be called. THOMAS AUSTIN re-examined. On the 3d of November, I apprehended Deakin; I was coming along by the Angel, tap; at Edmonton with him and Harland, Deakin was called into the tap, by some person, and asked to drink, but who by, I cannot say. I had no information about the prisoners then.TUFNEL - GUILTY . - DEATH . Aged 24.WILSON - GUILTY . - DEATH . Aged 35.Second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice Park.",guilty,none

ALLEY and LAW conducted the prosecution. JOHN FROST . I live in Arundel-street, Strand, and am a working silversmith and jeweller. On the morning ofthe 20th of November, I was awoke about twenty minutes after eight o'clock, by my errand boy, the prisoner, H. Brown, coming to my bed-room door, and crying out,""Master, Master, get up, you have been robbed, and every thing is stripped and turned topsy turvy."" He had lived six months with me; I immediately got up, went into the shop, and found the pins of my cabinet punched out; they contained the best part of my property; the pins of the hinges were out; the shop is in the back attic; the cabinet was secured by two bolts and a patent lock, (Braman's.) I had left it perfectly secure at ten o'clock the night before, as I imagined; but on the morning of the 19th, about seven o'clock, I had heard a knocking.Q. You found the pins punched out, in what state was the lock. - A. There had been an attempt to break open the lock, but they could not; the cabinet contained three hundred rings, lockets, watches, pins, seals, brooches, ear-rings, snuff-boxes, scent boxes, snaps, pearls, emeralds, &c. The whole of the property in the cabinet amounted to about one thousand seven hundred pounds; the whole of it was gone; I found all the drawers of the workshop scattered about, and about 500 l. worth of unfinished work gone, which had been in the drawers; I examined the drawers, they were all unlocked but one, and that one appeared to have been wrenched open by a crow bar; it was the foreman's drawer; Brown was with me when I examined, and found a metal gilt watch; he said,""Master, here is one of the watches,"" and cried bitterly; and said, what should he do, for I was ruined; I found three keys laying together in the workshop which did not belong to me, and two or three days after, we found a part of a dark lantern in a cistern, where the men used to wash themselves; my workman, Shepperd, found the other part of the lantern; the parts corresponded together; I found a lamp which I use, in the front parlour, which was not the place for it; I sent Brown to my father, and got assistance from Bow-street; a man who worked for me and had been recommended by Brown to me, stated something about his friends being bad, and we took Brown to Bow-street; he made application there to see me; I saw him, and held out no expectations whatever to him; Davis was present. JOHN DAVIS . I am an officer. I never held out any threat to Brown, to make him disclose what he did; he was kept in the front office till he went before the Magistrate, and was then locked up. It was the goaler told me the boy wanted to see his master. JOHN FROST re-examined. I went in with Davis, who said to him,""I understand you have something to say to your master."" Brown then said, that on the 19th of November, he let in Thomas and Brown. I am sure he mentioned those two, and I believe he mentioned Newman; but I cannot be sure; he said he let him in about seven o'clock; and after showing them round the shop where the property lay, and where they would find it, that they went up in the loft over the workshop, and concealed themselves there all day; and that we should find Thomas and Brown at a man named Allen, at Eagle-court, Catharine-street, and that one of the boys lived with Big Eyed Sook, and the other with Poll Lamb; and we should find one on the first floor back, and the other on the second floor front. He stated that he let them in on the day of the robbery; he said nothing more at that time. I asked him who punched the pins out of the cabinet; and he said he did; but did not say how. I have not recovered one article.Prisoner BROWN. Q. I never said I punched out the pins - A. He did, in Davis's presence.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he sleep in the house - A. No. He came about seven o'clock in the morning. He told me of the robbery about twenty minutes before eight.MR. LAW. Q. What time he came to the premises you cannot say - A. No. One of the servants would let him in. I know Stokes carried on the business of a steel pipe watch key maker; a furnace is not necessary in his business. I have been to his premises, and find he has one which will melt fifty ounces of gold at once.JOHN BROWN. In November last, I lodged in Mitchell-street, St. Luke's, in the same house as Mary Ann Eates . I know Henry Brown , and a boy named Thomas, and Newman - I am no relation to H. Brown - I knew where he lived. Before the 17th of November, we all had some talk about the robbery of Mr. Frost. I know Brooks; he was with us on Saturday night, the 17th; we were altogether under a gateway, two doors from Frost's. Brown, Thomas, Brooks, and Newman, were together - we agreed to do the robbery, and went under the gateway - we did not get in that night - it had been talked of several times when we had been at the play.Q. On the night you met, who began to talk of it. - A. We all agreed under the gateway to go in that night. Henry Brown came out after his master had paid him, which was between eight and nine o'clock, and said the robbery could not be done that night, as his master was in the workshop, doing up his books - we all parted, and agreed to meet on Monday, and asked if he would let us in; he said he would. On Monday morning, between five and six o'clock, Thomas, Newman, and I, went to the White Hart, public-house, Swan-yard. Brooks had not come. We went without him, as Brown said we must come directly, and he could not stop. Henry Brown came to us, and said we must come directly - we did not like to go, as Brooks had not come as he agreed on the Saturday, and meet us at the White Hart, Henry Brown went in first to his master's house, and after he had been in some little time, he came and opened the door, we three went in, and took our shoes off, and went up stairs. Brooks did not join us at all. We got up to the workshop at the top of the house. Brown said he would file the edge of the cabinet, which he did, as it should not make a noise when we came to open it. He then shewed us the cock-loft over the shop, where we were to hide - we went in there - we had three keys, and a dark lanthern. Henry Brown came up with some victuals to us; I told him to go to Mr. Allen's, and fetch me the crow-bar. Allen lives at No. 1, Eagle-court; he went and brought it to me - I told him to ask Allen for the victuals, and I suppose he brought the victuals from there. We continued in the loft all day, till between twelve and one one o'clock on Monday night, then got down and got into the workshop - we had a phosphorous box and dark lanthern. We opened all the workmen's drawers that we could; they were not fastened - one drawer on the left hand wasbroken open with a crow-bar. Some unfinished rings, a pair of gold watch cases, two gold snuff boxes, lined, and several other unfinished articles, and bits of gold, were taken from the drawers. We then took the cabinet hinges off, as Brown had directed us - they had been filed - we took from there eight gold watches, a few diamonds, a great quantity of rings, ear-rings, rubies, bracelets, and pearls. We left the drawers all scattered about the place, and tied the property up; we put some in our pockets, and some I carried in my hat - each took what he could - when we had got the property, we could not take the dark lantern or the keys; we threw the lantern in the cistern, and put the keys on the work bench - we took the crowbar away with us, and then came down stairs - it was between three and four o'clock. We could not get out, as the street door was double locked, and the key taken out. We opened the parlour window shutters, threw up the sash, and got out that way - we first went into the kitchen, - we went into the Strand, and took a coach, and went to Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell, to Charles Newman 's house. Mary Ann Eates was in bed there - she got up, opened the door, and let us in, and we all went in. Newman called her up. The street door is always open. We had the property with us. Newman said she must get up, because he wanted her. She lit the fire, put the kettle on, and then prepared some tea; and while the kettle was getting ready, we took out the property, and put it on the tea-board, and then put it on the bed. She was in the room at the time.Q. Was any thing said by either of you - A. She said she should like a pair of pearl ear-rings, and a locket, which would do for the child, to put hair in, and she should like one of the watches, which was done with pearls. We told her where the property came from; we asked her what the things would fetch. She said it would be about eighty pounds a piece. Newman said he must get up, for he wished her to carry these things to a place. We sorted the finished from the unfinished things. Newman put them into a bag. They were to be taken to the prisoner Williams, who called himself Stokes. Newman said they were to be carried there. Eates carried the bag - we all went with her to Stokes's house in a court in Goswell Street; we got there about six o'clock in the morning, and saw him; Newman called him on one side of the room. Stokes, Eates, and him, went out of the house to have something to drink, leaving me and Thomas in Stokes's workshop (he makes, steel pipes for watch keys). He returned in about ten minutes - Eates went away. Stokes's wife was then getting up; she came into the room, and he told her to go down, which she did. Newman then called Stokes aside, and told him he wanted his crucible; Stokes went and cleaned it out to melt the gold. Stokes made a fire and put it on, and we put the unfinished work in, such as watch cases and chains, and all the unfinished work, and melted it. The snuff boxes were given to Stokes, as he said he thought he could sell them, and one he said he would keep; they were made a present of to him, as he said he might sell them, and make a little money of them. Newman gave him two sovereigns for the use of the place to melt the gold, and gave him the two snuff boxes, and two old gold seals. There were only two snuff-boxes; the rest of the property was left at Stokes's. Mrs. Stokes came in, and we gave her a pair of ear-rings, and two finger rings, which she said she should like; we then wanted to know where we should sell the property. Newman called Stokes aside, and left me and Thomas by the fire; this was about two or three o'clock in the afternoon. We had been there all the morning, melting the gold - there was very little fire, and the heat was not sufficient. Newman came to us, and said he would take a coach, and fetch a man to buy the property. We took a coach, and went to Solomon's, Petticoat-lane - I, Newman, and Thomas went. Newman went in at the door, and we waited outside. In about five minutes he came out with Solomon, whom we took back to Stokes's with us in the coach. Stokes came into the room - he, Solomon, and Newman, went aside, and had some conversation together. Solomon said he would not look at the things there; but told us to go to the Rose and Crown, public-house, and he would take them there. We went to the Rose and Crown, public-house, Bunhill-row. Newman told us to go in the parlour, which we did. In about ten minutes Newman and Solomon came, with the property in two bags, as we had left it. Solomon brought it into the room - Newman had some private conversation with Solomon, and told me and Thomas to go into the yard; which we did. There was a window there, so that we could see all over the parlour; and saw the property on the table. Solomon was sorting it; we saw him put it in two bags, and twist it up; and then they called us on. Newman said he had agreed with Solomon about the property. We asked Solomon what he was to give for it. He said 200 l. for the whole - that he had only 100 l. with him, which he paid. He said he would fetch his partner, Isaac Nathan , for the other part of the jewellery, and he would pay the other 100 l. Solomon took the property, and went away; and between four and five o'clock, Nathan came to us in the public-house, said he had seen the property at Isaac Solomon 's house, and had got his half. We had something to drink in the parlour. Nathan told me and Thomas to go in the yard. We looked through the window, and saw him pay the 100 l. to Newman. Newman called us into the parlour - we had something to drink. Nathan said he had paid the 100 l. to Newman, which made up the 200 l. Yates came in, and we had something to drink at the bar - Nathan was gone then. The 100 l. was left in the care of Newman. Solomon came with Nathan, and was present when the 100 l. was paid - he brought Nathan. Nathan then gave me 15 l.; I had more afterwards, in all 30 l. After I received the 15 l., Solomon and Yates were drinking at the bar. Solomon said, the best thing I and Thomas could do, was to go into the country - we said we would - Nathan was gone then. Newman then told us to go to the Cobourg Theatre, and wait there till he came. I saw Brooks on the Friday - he said he heard the robbery had been done, and he expected his regulars, meaning the share of the money. We three gave him five sovereigns each, which made up 15 l. I directed Dawes to Solomon's and Nathan's houses.Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. At what time did you and the others meet in Swan-yard - A. On Monday morning between five and six o'clock; we got to the house about half six; Brown let us in, we saw him aboutbreakfast time; I sent him for the iron between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and did not see him after dinner time, which was one o'clock, till he was in custody.The Court ruled that there was no proof of Brown being a principal in the robbery, and as such, the indictment could not be sustained.

I work for a tailor and lodge up two pair of stairs in Windmill-court, Rosemary-lane, she had lodged on the one pair with her husband, the house is let out in lodgings; I remember on Thursday night the 18th of October, she was in my room that evening, from dusk till very near nine o'clock; it was the day Jacobs was taken up, she went out from my place about nine o'clock, and I saw no more of her that evening; she had neither bonnet, shawl, or silk handkerchief on.COURT. Q. You live on the second floor, might she not go into her own room - A. She borrowed a candle of me, went into her own room, returned the candle to me on the stairs, and went out without shawl, bonnet, or handkerchief on; she had no bason or any thing in her hand, she was very much in liquor indeed, I was quite sober; she came home about eleven o'clock, and called up the stairs to me, and said,""It is me,"" I made no answer; she called again, and I said,""Very well,"" she had left her door unfastened, I had not asked who was there; I did not see her again that night, she continued to live in the house till the 26th of October; I have not seen her since, till now.Prisoner.

She said, she was going to get a pint of beer; the street door is always open - her husband was on board a ship. I am married, and live with my husband; the prisonerhad lived in the house five or six weeks; I did not know her before. JAMES M'NIFF . I am a tailor, and live in the front garret, at No. 83, Rosemary-lane. On the 18th of October, from nine o'clock at night, till very near eleven o'clock, I was at the Seven Stars, public-house, Rosemary-lane; I knew Jacobs, by seeing him come there to drink his beer, he was a Prussian. I have since seen him in Newgate; he came to the Seven Stars a little before nine o'clock that night, and was very drunk indeed when he came in - he had a pint of beer and sat down by himself, in the same box as me, and while we sat there the prisoner came in; I am certain of her person; she was very much intoxicated; she took up his pint of porter and drank out of it; he rebuked her; he said,""You have no right to drink that, without my privilege"" - she called him a son of a w***e; he spoke to her again.COURT. Q. Did he use abusive language - A. No, he was grumbling; I said""Mr. Jacobs, it is very rude for any one to come and drink your beer, - I should not like it myself;"" the prisoner turned round and staggered towards the door, and when she recovered herself, she sat down by the side of Jacobs, and remained there till eleven o'clock - they did not talk together.Q. What happened near eleven o'clock - A. Jacobs got up, and said, I will go home - he was so much in liquor then, that he staggered up against the door, and was near falling; the prisoner was very tipsy, she said she would go, and in following him to the door, she fell down; I said I would go, and went over and picked her up; Jacobs went out - she followed him, and I followed them.Q. At any time during this period had the prisoner a bonnet or hat on her head, shawl or handkerchief on her neck, or bason in her hand - A. She had not, I am quite positive of it; Jacobs went on staggering, and she went after him, they went on as far as the Alderman Parson's head, public-house, which is about two hundred yards off in Rosemary-lane; it is the next public-house; she then put her hand round him, laid hold of his hair, and fell down, he tried to disengage himself from her, and owing to her drunkenness, she fell; a parcel of people came by, somebody helped her up; Jacobs went on, and I crossed the way, and left them - it was in my way home - I live at the further end of the lane.COURT. Q. How do you know this was the night Jacobs was taken up - A. Because I went up stairs and was eating my supper, and heard the call of Watch! I came down and asked a man who was passing, what was the matter - he said, it was a drunken man, named Jacobs, going to the watch-house; I did not go to see him; I had my work to go to in the morning - I did not see Jacobs again.Q. Had you not the curiosity to go to the watch-house next day - A. No, I went to work at six o'clock; I did not see him till after he was convicted; I did not know it would get to such serious consequences; I did not know where he lived; I worked for Messrs. Gilson and Smith, of Poplar, at the time; I had just come from work, and only drank a pint of beer; Mr. Husband keeps the public-house - I am sure she is the woman, I have known her, by sight, four or five years.Prisoner. I have not been in this country eighteen months.Witness. To the best of my knowledge, I have known her four or five years - I am sure it is above eighteen months.JURY. Q. Did he use any violence to her, previous to her falling - A. No, except to disengage himself from her. ELIZA ATKINSON . I live in White's-yard, Rosemary-lane, in the two pair front room, and work in a glasshouse, for Mr. Glover. On the night Jacobs was taken, I was at the end of White's-yard, about eleven o'clock, I never saw the prisoner before that, she asked me if there was any public-house open where she could get refreshment; Jacobs was by her; I did not know him; I saw him next day at Lambeth-street office, under examination.Q. Jacobs was with her - A. Yes, he and the prisoner were standing together at the top of Whites'-yard; they were both very much intoxicated; the prisoner had a blue gown on, and her bosom was all exposed; she had neither shawl, bonnet, or handkerchief on, or bason in her hand. I told her the White Lion, in White Lion-street, was open. Whites'-yard is about twenty-yards from Alderman Parson's head, and more than that from the Seven Stars; she and Jacobs went round White Lion-street, and while they were walking along she called for assistance of the watchman.Q. Did you see what happened to make her cry - A. No, they had got a little way from me; I went up, and she then gave charge of Jacobs for robbing her of her shawl, bonnet, and one shilling.COURT. Q. You heard the charge? A. Yes, Jacobs attempted to strike her.Q. Had he hold of her - A. No, for the watchman knocked him down, then sprang his rattle, and brought more assistance; Jacobs made no resistance; I followed him to Whitechapel watch-house; he was taken from there to Wellclose-square, as they were repairing the watch-house; I was returning home, and two watchmen took me in custody, as the prisoner swore I took the property from Jacobs; the watchman told me she said so, and she swore it at Lambeth-street, next day. When she was giving charge of Jacobs, she said she was a married woman; I said, if she was, she would not be out at that time of night, and an hour after that she gave charge of me.Q. Then you was not taken in charge as you were returning home - A. Yes, the watchman charged me with receiving the property; I was not taken for an hour after, and was at the watch-house - I had been waiting near Wellclose-square.Q. If a gentleman meets you, you go home with him. A. I am out at night - I never saw Jacobs before.COURT. Q. Were you discharged at Lambeth-street A. Yes, I was taken before the Justice - and discharged; I knew nothing about Jacobs' trial; I did not think it would come to such a pitch as it did; Jacobs did not know where I lived - I was not sent for - I knew nothing about Jacobs' trial.Q. When did you first tell any one what you knew of this business - A. About two days after, several people came to Lambeth-street, and I told them; I was applied to to become a witness on this trial about a month or six weeks after.Prisoner. I never saw this woman till she was following Jacobs, and came behind him, and took something from him, and the watchman saw her.Witness. I did not.MR. JOHN NICHOLSON . I live with my father, who is a silversmith, and lives in Cornhill. On the night of the 18th of October, I was passing the end of Rosemary-lane, it was after eleven o'clock; I saw the prisoner - I do not recognise her features - but from her stature and appearance I believe it to be her; I saw Jacobs and a woman (whom I believe to be her) in contact together; he had hold of her arm, and did not seem inclined to loose it - some words passed between them both, and in about two minutes a watchman crossed over and laid hold of Jacobs, and endeavoured to loosen the woman from Jacobs' hold; he released her for a moment, but she came round towards the watchman and he caught hold of her again; the watchman endeavoured to loosen her again, but finding he could not do it easily he struck the man three or four times over the arm; and in consequence of their struggling several watchmen came to their assistance; I do not recollect the rattles springing; they then endeavoured to get him to the watch-house, which they had great difficulty, and trouble to do - he laid hold of the shutters, and did what he could to prevent them; then one of the watchmen came behind and struck him a violent blow over the head, and knocked him down; both him and the woman were drunk, beyond a doubt - there was never more than a dozen persons collected.Q. Did any of them use any threat to the woman what they would do, or threaten any violence - A. None whatever, I am positive of it - Jacobs was taken to the watch-house - I left them.COURT. Q. Did you hear whether the man was charged with any offence - A. As far as I saw, the woman was running about the street saying,""I will give charge of him,"" but I did not hear what she charged him with; she had neither bonnet or shawl on - she was brandishing her hands about.Q. How came you to hear of this matter - A. At the time it occurred, I did not hear the man's name, nor did I hear the trial, but I read the trial in the Sessions Paper; and hearing the man was ordered for execution, I supposed it to be the same party as I had seen; I made enquiry; went to Newgate to see the man, and knew him to be the man; he referred me to his master; when I went to see him I told him what his dress was at the time - it was a slouched hat.Prisoner. It is false that I was ever in the middle of the street - or said I would give charge of him.Witness. I am sure of it.Prisoner's Defence. All I have to say is, that when I was here before I told the truth; when I was at the office all the blunder I made was, the watchman said it did not matter whether I said where I was going, and at the office I said I was going for a pail of water; but before you, my Lord, I told the truth.The prisoner then handed in a paper complaining that she was prosecuted by a wicked set, who were determined to have her life, that they had come forward at the expence of 3000 l. to prosecute her, and had purchased witnesses against her; that it was a conspiracy against her life; that she considered herself entitled to the name of Alderson, as she lived with Alderson on honourable terms.JAMES M'NIFF re-examined. She was at the Seven Stars, public-house, two hours - the landlord is not here. GUILTY .

I am servant to Edmund Wakefield Mead, who lives at Kensington. On the 26th of December, I went to Tottenham in the chaise, I passed the prisoner in the Kingsland-road, he asked if he might get up and ride, I consented; we stopped at the Bull inn, Tottenham; I took the things out of the chaise, and he helped me to carry them into the back parlour, this was about four o'clock; I went away for three hours, leaving him in the room. I returned to the Bull inn, about seven o'clock, and found him in the passage; he said, he had been waiting for me an hour; I said, I should be ready in five minutes; he said, he had got one of my great coats, because I should not go off without him, he was an entire stranger to me; I harnessed the horses in five minutes, and when I returned from the stable, he was gone, also both the coats and the matt; next morning, I went to the Bethnal-green, and saw the prisoner going by, and told him he was the man who robbed me last night; he said, he never saw me in his life. I dragged him into a pawnbroker's, and sent for an officer, he then gave up his keys, and Dyer found the property.Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. Was he not intoxicated - A. No; I never said, I believed he did not intend to steal them; he never told me where he lived; I had information, which led me to Bethnal-green. When I took him, he said, he would give them up, if I would pardon him. JAMES DYER . I am a constable. I was sent for to a pawnbroker's shop, and found the prisoner there, he said,""Mr. Dyer, you know me very well, I am a respectable man in this parish, I know nothing of this concern at all, don't collar me."" I said,""I would not;"" I was taking him along the street, he said,""I will deliver up the keys of my stable, where you will find the coats, and in my house you will find the matt;"" he then asked me to let him go, I refused. After locking him up; I went to his house, and found them, as he stated; he at first said, he knew nothing of the prosecutor at all.(Property produced and sworn to.)Prisoner's Defence. I certainly took them, and my reason for denying it was, because I was known in the neighbourhood. I had been waiting for the man a long time, I was elevated in liquor, and what possessed me togo away with them, I cannot say, I did not intend it; but I got on the coach, and intended to return them.

MATTHEW RIPPINGHAM . I am in Mr. Collins's office. On the 11th of December, I heard he had been robbed; I went to the shop of one Bailey, Holywell-street, near Shoreditch turnpike; between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, and saw the two prisoners in the shop, they had a small round close basket. I had previously told Bailey, my suspicions, he was to buy the four pigeons that they had brought; I waited in the shop till they were bought, and then examined, and knew them to be Mr. Collins's property. I went out and returned in about half an hour; while I was there with one of the pigeons in my hand, the prisoner came again with the same basket, and a larger one, which was full of pigeons, I think about seven or eight pair, and the smaller one had about four pair, I knew them to be Mr. Collins's. When they came in, I put the one I had into another basket, that they might not suspect; Gascoigne looked at me, and said to Green,""The gentleman has got one of the pigeons which we brought this morning;"" he said to me,""That is a fine pigeon, it is so tame, it will go about the house."" I asked if it was one of his, he said,""Yes,"" and pointed to the two baskets which he had brought; I lifted up the lid of the small basket, and saw four of Mr. Collins's pigeons. I got a constable, and asked Gascoigne how he got them; he said, he bought them of a neighbour, who kept pigeons. I said, it was strange, he should buy of one dealer to sell to another, he made no answer; Green said, he knew nothing about them, he only assisted in carrying them. WILLIAM HAGGIS .

Gascoigne said, If I would come to his house at seven o'clock at night, two men would bring some more pigeons and live pigs; I went and stopped till nine o'clock, nobody came to it.MR. COLLINS. I am certain the pigeons are mine.- BAILEY. I live in High-street, Shoreditch.

I saw Smith in Farringdon-street, Russell-square, (which leads into the mews behind Mr. Phillimore's house) with a large bundle. I went after him, and asked him what he had there - he said he did not know. I asked whose it was - he said it was not his. I told him that was an evasive answer, and I should take him custody. I foundit contained the articles stated in the indictment - I asked where it came from - he at first said it belonged to his fellow-servant, and then that he brought it from Mr. Phillimore's stables. I took him to the watch-house - then went to Mr. Phillimore's, and saw the coachman in the stable. I searched for the prisoner Nicholls; but could not find her. About five minutes after, I saw her in the house, in a very great perspiration, and very muddy - it was wet weather. I took her into the library, and asked how she became possessed of the property I had taken from Smith - she said she could account for every thing but the iron pot - and that some of them were given to her; which Mrs. Phillimore denied. I took her to No. 5, Coram-place, to Smith's, her brother-in-law, as she called him; but could find no such person. I searched her at the watch-house, and found twenty-six keys, and sixteen sovereigns on her - she said it was a general custom with servants who had been a long time in place, to take care of themselves, and she supposed I saw no harm in it - she then asked if there was no way of getting a friend to bribe me. I desired her to hold her tongue.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. When did you first see her - A. About nine o'clock - I saw Smith at eight o'clock. Mr. Phillimore claimed three or four of the keys, and I found they opened the drawers which he pointed out. ROBERT HEAP . On the 14th of December, about half-past eight o'clock, I went to Mrs. Phillimore's - Smith had been taken - we went to the stables, and saw the coachman there - went into the house, to look for Nicholls; but was not there - in about ten minutes, I saw her come in at the back door, from the street. She was asked where she had been? she said she had not been out of the house - she was very muddy, wet, and in a dreadful perspiration. She was questioned before Mrs. Phillimore, and said Mrs. Phillimore had given her the things - which Mrs. Phillimore denied. She did not say the iron pot was given to her; she said her brother-in-law, Smith, lived at No. 5, Coram-place. I asked why she said she had not been out - she said she did it to please her mistress. We went to Coram-place; but could not find him. I was present when she was told the bundle was found on Smith. The articles were read over to her - she said every thing but the iron pot was given to her. JAMES HOBSON . I was coachman to Mr. Phillimore. On the 14th of December, about a quarter before eight o'clock, Smith came to the stable door, and asked leave to speak to the cook - he had no bundle then. I sent her out to him. RICHARD GUNTHORP . I am footman to Mr. Phillimore. When the officers came to the house, I was in the pantry. Nicholls came and asked me for the key of the area gate - I unlocked it for her; and while I stood there, I was told the officers were in the house. She ran across the road as hard as she could, in the direction for Coram-place, which is not above five minutes walk from the house. I think she returned before she could have gone there. WILLIAM PHILLIMORE , ESQ. I live in Upper Montagu-street. Nicholls was four years in my service, as cook. The officer produced two bundles of keys, and several separate ones. I told him immediately that one loose one would open the tea-caddy, and the other the library table drawer, where I keep the keys of my cellar. I tried them, and they opened it - and four more on one of the bunches, I believe to be mine. One fitted the library table at my chambers, and the other the celeret. I had lost them about a year.

I was married last April, and bought these things for my own use; Mrs. Phillimore was very short of things, and I used them occasionally for her. I went to my sister, in Coram-place, and asked her to send her husband or brother to me. I gave Smith the things, and told him to wait in Russell-square for me. PATIENCE SMITH .

ALLEY conducted the prosecution. WILLIAM DUCKETT . I am gardener to Mrs. Maria Kelly , a widow, who lives at Harrow-on-the-hill, in Harrow parish; she was in London the early part of January. The female servants and myself were at home on the 15th of January, and went to bed about ten o'clock, leaving the house all fast; I sleep on the first floor. After twelve o'clock, I heard a tapping, and then saw the glare of a candle pass my room door, which was not shut to - I rose up in bed and asked who was there, a man said,""Never you mind."" I got out of bed, and two men met me at the door; one of them had a pistol; they induced me to lay down, and having no arms, I complied - they asked me where the plate was; I said my mistress had got it in town; they then went into my mistress's bed room on the same floor as mine, and broke open some locks; they then went out of that room into the best bed room. I heard them opening the locks there.Q. Did both the men leave your room - A. No; one of them remained with me, and the other went away; while he was with me, I heard some other person in the house; I heard two persons talking together - one of those who had been in the bed room said to the one who was with me,""Blow his brains out,"" this was after I said there was no plate, there was some in the room I heard them go into - I heard them breaking locks open, and while they were doing so, I heard one of them say,""D - n him, blow his brains out."" The two went down stairs; the man still remained with me - one of them called out from the bottom of the stairs,""Riches,"" and then the man left me. The key of my room was inside the door when I went to bed; I found it afterwards outside - the man returned to me in about five minutes, he opened the door, looked in, and said,""Are you all right,"" I said I was there, he then went away, and my door was then fastened. I got out at the window in about ten minutes, and went to a neighbouring farm-house, and got assistance; I returned to the house and found the front gate open, which I had locked over night. I found the scullery door open, which was fastened the night before, and the glass of the window broken; there was room enough to admit a man through the casement - the scullery leads into the kitchen. I found property laying about, and in the best bed room there was a bundle of wearing apparel packed up.COURT. Q. Had you any opportunity of seeing them - A. I only got a glimpse of them; the candle was not brought into my room - I heard three speak in the room, and it was a different voice which called out Riches, it was not the same voice which said,""D - n him, shoot him;"" I think there were four voices, I am certain there were three; one spoke in an Irish tone. Cochran had lived with my mistress - I cannot say whether either of the voices were like his. I am sure I made the house fast. One man was taller than the others. ELIZABETH BOWEN . I am servant to Mrs. Kelly. The gardener alarmed me when he came from the farm-house. I came down stairs, and found a door broken open in the best bed-room, where the plate and other valuable articles were kept; the plate was gone - I went into the cellar where there was a large box containing candles, which was locked and safe when we went to bed; it stood on a wine bin in the cellar - it was broken open, and a good many candles had been used from it. The matches are kept in a cupboard in the kitchen; I found they were burnt all over the lower part of the house, and we found a great deal of candle grease on the carpet by the best bed room door. I left the things in the same state until my mistress saw them. MARY BOWEN . I am servant to Mrs. Kelly, and was in the house that night. When my mistress went to town she left a watch on the chimney piece in her bed room; I put it in a drawer - a black ribbon, seal, and key were attached to it. I have seen it since. Cochran did not live there with me.MRS. MARIA KELLY . I am a widow. I was in town at the time of the robbery - I heard of it next morning went home immediately, and found things in great disorder, and my clothes laying on the bed room floor. I had leftsome drawers unlocked, and from those drawers the things were taken - there was a very strong closet in the wall of the best bed room, it appeared like a door going into another room; I locked that closet myself when I went to town, and took the key with me. I left plate, and a variety of property there; I found it forced open and the things taken away - I had left a plate box with four dozen table spoons, two dozen silver forks, a silver vase and cover, a fish knife, two silver ink bottles of Bramah's construction, a gold pencil case, and snuff box, they were all gone. My dressing box was also broken open, and from that a gold curb watch-chain was taken, also the silver bottles, and some ribbons were taken. I had had the ribbons since 1809; I had them when I was shipwrecked off the East Indies, and they were valuable to me on that account - I kept them in my dressing box where I was in the habit of frequently seeing them. I think I saw them the day before I went to town - I know them by one being of a particular pattern, and they are stained with sea water. I had left a watch hanging over the chimney piece in my bed room - that was gone, it had a black ribbon, seal, and a key, attached to it - but when I saw it at Bow-street, it had the same seal, and key, and the curb chain attached to it, the ribbon was gone. Cochran lived seven months in my service, and left on the day of the Coronation. The candles were kept in a coal cellar next to the kitchen; the door was pannelled, so as to represent the wall, and when the kitchen door was open, three parts of it would be covered - I think when the kitchen door was open nobody could suppose a door was there. The candle box was on a bin in the cellar. When I was in the country, I kept my money in a chest of drawers in the dining room - when I went to town, I never left it there; I do not know whether Cochran was acquainted with that, he knew I kept it there when at home. The four dozen spoons were worth 24 l. WILLIAM SCOTT . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 21st of January, about twelve o'clock, I was going down Chandos-street, towards St. Martin's-lane, and saw Osborne, Cochran, and one Brown - I met Sayers, and we followed them into St. Martin's-lane, and saw Osborne and Cochran go up under the Golden Cross gateway - I laid hold of Osborne, and took him over the way to Mrs. Mountains, into the back parlour; when he got in, he shifted something from his pocket to the floor, he slipped it down inside his trowsers, his hand was in his pocket at the time; I observed him fumbling his hand about, and his watch came out at the bottom of his trowsers on the floor; he stamped his foot on it - I said it will do you no service, I shall take you to justice all the same; he got out of my hold, picked up the watch, and threw it against the fire place - I secured him; upon searching him, I found a gold repeater, a black ribbon, seal, and key, also a belcher silk handkerchief. I was with Sayers when he took the other man. Cochran gave the name of Morrison.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. This was five days after the robbery - A. Yes. I knew nothing of the robbery at the time. The gateway is a very public place. The watch glass was broken.COURT. Q. Were they talking together - A. I saw Osborne, Cochran, and Brown talking together three or four times that day, which caused my suspicion. Brown was afterwards taken and discharged. ISAAC SAYER . I am a constable. I assisted in securing the prisoners - I took Cochran. I first saw all three together at the corner of Bedfordbury; Brown and Cochran were walking arm in arm, and Osborne was before them, speaking to them over his shoulder; I took Cochran, Brown immediately ran down to Charing-cross. I took Cochran into Mrs. Mountain's, and searched him; he gave me the name of Morrison - he attempted to escape from me with a great deal of force, while Osborne was being searched; I forced him into the parlour, he immediately jumped on the table, lifted up the window leading into the yard, rolled out, and fell down into the yard, about fifteen feet - I went down and took him again, he walked into the parlour; I searched him, and found a pocket handkerchief, and two keys on him.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many men besides were apprehended for this robbery - A.Three others, who were discharged. WILLIAM SCOTT . One of the keys produced is a pick-lock key. I have been an officer twelve months. I have not tried it to open any thing. RICHARD MAYBANK . I have been an officer twenty years. I call this a complete skeleton key.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you seen Bramah's keys - A. I have seen many of them, but none like these. ROBERT CHAPMAN . I am an officer of Bow-street. I searched Clare's apartments at No. 3, Middlesex-court, Drury-lane, and found a pistol, not loaded, concealed in a cupboard behind a partition, at the head of the bed. I found the ribbon in a deal chest which was not locked; Clare claimed the ribbon at Bow-street - he said it was given him by a young woman, who was gone to America, three years ago.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Clare was not in custody when you found them - A. No; he was attending the examination of the prisoners, at the time I brought it to the office. Clare was then at the bar - the ribbon was not put in his hand, it laid on the table before the Magistrate; I believe he said he had used part of it to tie up his arm when he was bled.Q. Did not the Justice ask him,""Had you any ribbon in your box"" - A. I believe it was to that effect, but it laid on the table before him, about four yards from him; he asked to see the ribbon at the last examination, but it was not there then - at the first examination, he said it was given to him. The pistol is rather fowl inside, and does not appear to have been recently used.MR. ALLEY. Q. When the ribbon was produced at the first examination, had he not a full opportunity of seeing it - A. He had. Both him and Osborne asked to see it at the second examination, but it was not there.MR. JAMES HARMER . I am solicitor to the prosecutrix. I attended the examination, and heard what Clare said, he was brought to the office, in the middle of the examination of the other prisoners, he was first brought close to the Magistrate's table - Sir R. Birnie produced the ribbon, and asked what account he had to give of those ribbons, which were found in his box, he was within a quarter of a yard of them - he said they were given to him three years ago by a young woman, who was gone to America; Sir R. Birnie then ordered him to be put to the bar with theother prisoners - I know this was not taken down in writing.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often did you attend before this - A. Once; I believe Mr. Price attended, I cannot say he attended professionally for them, but at the next examination Osborne said he had an attorney at the two former examinations, but he had not said a word for them, and it was of no use to have him. I attended three examinations, but there had been others. Sir R. Birnie sent for Clare, and directly he came Sir Richard held the ribbons up, and asked how he came by them, and was told there were three pieces - he said there should be four, and they were given him three years ago, by a young woman who was gone to America, and that he had used one to bind his arm after being bled. WILLIAM WOODS . I am clerk to the Magistrates of Bow-street, and recollect Clare being examined, I did not take down what he said.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many examinations were there - A. Clare was there first on the 7th of February, there had been three examinations before that; I had seen him at one of these examinations, Sir R. Birnie, sent for him, and put a few questions to him, as it was said Osborne lodged with him; but Mr. Birchs's foreman spoke in his favour, and he was suffered to go at large; he was at large several days before he was taken again. I understood Osborne to be some relation of his. Brown and one Woodley were also taken on this charge.MR. ALLEY. Q. When Clare was let at large the ribbon was not found - A. No. He was questioned on the 4th of February, and taken again on the 7th. WILLIAM LEE . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 4th of February, I went with Chapman to Middlesex-court, and found the ribbon which I produce. Clare was being questioned while we were searching his lodging, he was not in custody when we returned. I kept them till he was in custody. The prosecutrix saw them at the office on the 7th.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who told you where the lodging was - A. I heard him tell the Magisstrate he lived there, and that Osborne lodged at the same place. The ribbon was at the bottom of his box. There was nothing but old worn out clothes there. WILLIAM SCOTT . I produce the watch found on Osborne.MRS. KELLY. The watch, seal, key, and chain are mine, the seal has a motto - the ribbon I know perfectly well, there were several small pieces; I can speak to two pieces, one I used to wear buckled round my waist; and here are the buckle holes. I left home on the 26th of December. MARY BOWEN . I know the watch to be my mistress's; I saw it on the 15th, in the bed-room.COCHRAN'S Defence. One morning when Osborne was in a public-house, I saw him buy the watch of three men, but I did not know the watch then - they would not let me see it. When we came down St. Martin's-lane, I did not observe that Osborne was in custody - I went up the gateway, and saw the officer with him. The reason I escaped out of window was because I was afraid of being taken for a small debt which I owed.OSBORNE'S Defence. I was in the public-house this morning, and bought the watch of three young people who called me aside; Cochran came too, and they told me to take him away - I bought the watch for 25 s., and told them they had taken me in and sold me a metal chain for a gold one. I had no conversation with Cochran. I was in St. Martin's-lane, they took me, and as I came out of the gateway, I saw the man I bought it of running up the lane as hard as he could, and the officer collared me then, but not before.CLARE'S Defence. I have no knowledge of the ribbons, I have no deal box in my room. I went to the office two or three times before I was taken. Scott asked where I lived and worked; I told him, he took my direction down in his book - he left word with Osborne that I could find him when I choosed, at a public-house; I suppose he wanted me to give him money. The prisoner's attorney advised me to go out of the way till they were committed; I said I should not, but went to work as usual till Thursday, though they had searched my room on Monday. I said there were four pieces of ribbon, but there had been seven; I had used three when I was bled - I had not seen them for four months. WILLIAM SCOTT re-examined. I collared Osborne, and then Brown began to run, but not before, I am positive. I am sure they were all three talking together several times between Chandos-street, and St. Martin's-lane, Clare gave me his right name. I do not recollect his saying where he lived; I made no memorandum of it.One witness gave Osborne a good character. GEORGE CROCKFORD . I am apprentice to Mr. Birch, of Queen-street, a coachmaker. Clare worked there two years and a half as painter - he attended business as usual during this investigation. I had given him the pistol to stain the handle for me, about a fortnight before I went to Bow-street - it is in the same condition now.COCHRAN - GUILTY . - DEATH .

HENRY ARCHARD . I am porter to Messrs. Brook and Co., and have been so nearly seven years. On the 23d of January, I saw Rushworth go away about six o'clock; he had no bundle then, I left the warehouse about seven o'clock, and was in Crooked-lane, and saw him there, as I was going to my uncle's in the Borough. He had something in a wrapper then - I went up and took hold of it, in a jocular way, and said,""You, Yorkshireman,"" I pulled it, and he pulled, and I thought he seemed confused. I asked what he was going to do with it, he gave me no answer; I asked him again, and he said""Home."" We walked together, and I asked if he was going to leave it any where in the morning, he said""Yes,"" but did not say where. He asked me to have some gin, I said""No."" We then went to my uncle's, the Paviour's Arms, Fishmonger-alley - I asked again what he was going to do with it, he made no answer, put it on the settle, and moved away from it, and I saw by the corner, that it was serge. He owed me 18 s. I told him I would thank him for it, as soon as he could, for I was short; he said he had got the serge out to pay me, and if I would go in the parlour, he would tell me all about it, as he thought I had some suspicion. We went into the parlour, he begged me to say nothing about it. I said it would be the best way to tell me about it, and I would not tell - he left the serge at my uncle's, I put a seal on the bundle. I saw Mr. Webb next morning, and told him all I knew. About eleven o'clock that morning, Rushworth and I went together to Byford, to the front of the warehouse; I asked Byford how he came to take the piece out, he said he did do it, was very sorry, and hoped I would say nothing about it, and said he would get the serge away from my uncle's at dinner time, take it to the dyer's, and they would bring it back with one hundred and fifty returns - they were taken in custody on the following morning.

ANDREWS. Q. The men usually leave at six o'clock - A. Yes; Rushworth passed me as he went out, and wished me good night - he had nothing then; the serge is too large to be concealed - I parted with him that night, and by agreement, went with him to Byford the next morning. I had told my master, and had his approbation for what I was doing - I told Byford it was a bad job, and he said it was. I asked him how he came to get it out, because Rushworth had told me Byford had got it out - he asked if I had said any thing about it, I said""No;"" he said he did do it, and was sorry for it. I did not say they should not be hurt - they were taken in custody half an hour after. I locked the serge in my own room till I sealed it. WILLIAM DRINKWATER .

I was going home, along Cow-lane, I was quite sober; on turning the corner, about the middle of the lane, a man came on my right hand, and struck me a violent blow on the stomach, which made me reel, and in a second I missed my watch, which was safe before he struck me - that was not the prisoner, but the prisoner was close to me, and ran off immediately after the man who struck me ran; he did not cry out after the man, but kept running down the lane before me, to prevent my following the man who struck me, and kept jogging across the gutter, and immediately as I lost sight of that man, the prisoner stopped. Nobody else was near me; I seized him, without losing sight of him, the watch has not been found, it cost nine guineas.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you cry Stop thief! as soon as you missed your watch - A. Not half a minute after I received the blow the thief ran by me, and then the prisoner ran too - I do not believe he was pursuing the thief; he said he had no objection to my sending for an officer, and stopped quietly with me for a quarter ofan hour till one came. I held him all the while, he gave different accounts of himself.COURT. Q. Did the prisoner attempt to stop the man when he started - A. No; but kept running across me, right and left, to prevent my getting up to the man, and that made me take him. WILLIAM SHUTER . I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner between nine and ten o'clock, and took him to the watch-house. I asked where he had been that evening, he said to one Williams, in Fetter-lane, for some shoemaker's lasts; that he lived in French-alley, Goswell-street, and worked at a large tobacconists in the Minories, for three years, up to the present time. I was taking him to Fetter-lane, he said it was no use to take him, I had better take him to the Compter - I however, took him to the place he described, and enquired, in his hearing, but no such person as Williams was to be found. I then took him to the Minories, and on going along, he said, he had not worked there for eighteen months - I found nobody to give me an answer; he then said he got his living by going into the country with cheese and fruit.

I have frequently known them leave the stable door open. HENRY ETHERINGTON . I was returning from Hampstead-road, on the 20th of January, about seven o'clock, it was quite dark, I had occasion to call in Francis-street, a young man was with me; we had knocked at the door, and heard a loud cry of Stop thief! in Francis-street; two men were then running from the dark part of Francis-street, towards Tottenham-court-road; I pursued one, who passed me, through Francis-street, into Tottenham-court-road, and at the corner of the chapel, I took a crowbar from his hand, as he struck back with it to keep me off; he made off to the other side, but before he could reach there, he was so exhausted, that he stumbled against a stone and fell. I secured him and took him back to Collings - I believe Hatfield to be the man, but I cannot be sure; he very much resembles him. I gave him in the charge of Collings, he was locked in the stable till the officer came - I do not like to swear to him. THOMAS COOK . On the 20th of January, I was in my own house, in Francis-street, and between half-past six and seven o'clock, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I went to the door and saw men run by, I cannot say how many; I believe the first passed just as I opened the door, and a few yards from my door, I saw Parkins stopped, a scuffle ensued, and I collared him; he picked his hat up, which was off, he walked with me to the stable, where Collings lived, he and several others were there. About three or four minutes after, I saw Attfield, I believe him to be the man. Etherington brought him in, Parkins walked very quietly back with me to the stable, and then said, I had taken the wrong man.Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say he was the second who ran by - A. No; several people were running. WILLIAM STANTON . I am a constable. I was sent for to Collings's, the prisoners were given in my charge, they are the two men; I sent to Cousins to assist me, and I searched Parkins, we took them to the watch-house, they were nearly half an hour in the stable - Etherington gave me the crow-bar.

WILLIAM TUCK . I am a greengrocer, and live in Legg-alley, Long-acre, in the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-fields. I know nothing of the prisoner myself - I lost my trunk the latter end of November, or beginning of December, 1820. It was in the one pair back room, I saw it about an hour before it was lost, (between three and five o'clock in the afternoon) - I do not know whether the outer door was latched. The house was let out in tenements, and the landlord did not live in it; I have the first floor, I locked the outer door of my apartment myself that day, and took the key with me - I came home about half-past four o'clock, it was light then, the trunk was gone, I have not seen it since, but have seen a silk shawl in pawn, which was in it.

Q. Did you not say at Union Hall, that you lost it a fortnight before Christmas - A. A fortnight or more, I cannot say the day - It was on a Monday. MARGARET TUCK . I am the wife of the last witness. I I found the shawl in pawn about a fortnight ago. WILLIAM TUCK re-examined. When I came home, I found the staple drawn out and the door open, it was fastened by a padlock, which I found hanging on the door; there is one common passage to all the different apartments. WILLIAM TARRANT . I am servant to Mr. Gray, a pawnbroker in Fleet-street. I have a shawl which was pawned on the 30th of November, 1820. I took it in myself, from a woman whom I believe to be the prisoner's wife - I have frequently seen them together, they addressed each other as man and wife; the prisoner came a short time ago, for an affidavit of his losing the ticket; he said he had lost the duplicate of the shawl, and had sent his wife before to stop it, (she had been to stop it). I did not shew it to him; he spoke of it, as a shawl pawned in the name of Conner - I have the duplicate here; I gave him a printed form of affidavit, which I have since seen in Goff's possession. GEORGE GOFF . I am a constable of Lambeth. I have a printed form of affidavit, which I got from Barnacle. WILLIAM BARNACLE . I got this printed affidavit from the prisoner.WILLIAM TARRANT re-examined. It is the paper I gave the prisoner on his saying the duplicate was lost - he never brought it back.This printed paper was put in and read, signed by the prisoner, but it was not sworn, it described the shawl as in the duplicate. WILLIAM TARRANT . I filled this up by his direction, in his presence. I have known him and his wife some time.(Shawl produced and sworn to). WILLIAM BARNACLE . I lived last with Mr. Newcombe, of Bloomsbury-square. I know the prisoner, he asked me to pawn a shawl like this, which I refused, this was the latter end of November, 1820; he asked me also to pawn two white gowns, two white petticoats, a dark silk gown, a black silk cloak, and a table cloth; he and his wife asked me to pawn them at the corner of Seacoal-lane, I refused - they then asked me to pawn the shawl, which I refused. I called on the prisoner in Newgate, in December last, when he was imprisoned there; he asked me to do him a favour, I said I would, he said,""My wife has left me, and gone to live with another man, and she has got a shawl which will hang me; it came out of Legg-alley;"" he gave me a note to carry to Mr. Gray, which I did - he told me to go and stop it before his wife got it out, as if she got it she would hang him, as it was one of the shawls taken from Legg-alley. At the time the robbery was committed in Legg-alley, in November, 1820; I was going to have my hair cut at Lumley's, which was the house it was committed at, and the prisoner came out of the house as I went in, with a large trunk on his shoulder; he went towards the bottom of Hart-street, and the next day, the prisoner came to my lodging, in a court in Fleet-street, and asked me to walk out with him, which I did; he took me into a gin shop in Fleet-market, where his wife and another woman were, they had two bundles, and asked me to have some gin with them, which I did, and on leaving the shop, they asked me to pawn the things; I had heard of the robbery, and that was the reason I would not - I did not know these were the things stolen, but was afraid, as they were dangerous characters.Prisoner. Q. I believe he had the trunk himself. Have you not been to Bow-street, for passing bad money?The witness being informed that he had a right to refuse answering this question, declined.COURT. Q. What made you go to him in Newgate - A. He sent for me. I went backwards and forwards to see him till he came out, as he said he was distressed. WILLIAM TARRANT . The witness, delivered me a note from the prisoner, which I have destroyed, it stated that he had lost the duplicate, and wished to stop the shawl - I believe the signature on the form of affidavit not to be the prisoner's writing. I have seen him write. GEORGE GOFF . I apprehended the prisoner, he said he bought the shawl of a man named Swiney; afterwards he said he did not buy the shawl, but bought a duplicate of it, and that it was in pledge at Guest's in Fleet-market, with a sheet - I went to Guest's, and searched the books, but could find no account of it.Prisoner. Q. What information did Barnacle give you - A. He said the shawl came from a crack, I asked how he knew that; he said the prisoner and his wife had quarrelled and the prisoner was afraid his wife would have him hung, and he gave him the affidavit to take care of.Prisoner's Defence. Barnacle sold the ticket of the shawl to my wife, it was pawned with a shirt, she redeemed it and pawned the shawl. If he knew I robbed the house, why not give information; he owes me money, and has robbed me - I said I would have satisfaction, and then he gave information. GUILTY - DEATH .

Bank notes , his property. CHARLES ATWELL . I am a bookseller, and live in Brown-street, Bryanstone-square, St. Mary-le-bone. The prisoner was about ten days in my service, I had no character with her, but a recommendation from a Mrs. Harrington, who she had lodged with. On Sunday, the 6th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went out, leaving her in the house. I have three children, I took two out, leaving her with one - I returned about a quarter past five o'clock, she was not at home, I found the door a-jar. On my knocking, the pressure forced it open, I found the parlour door open also, and on examining it, found the bolt of the lock out, but it had passed beyond the staple. On going into the parlour, my wife went to a chest of drawers, which were not locked, and missed a small red box, in which I kept my cash. On the night before, I had put some cash in this box, there was some there before - there was six 10 l., Bank notes, upwards of forty sovereigns, between 2 l. and 3 l. in silver, also a black leather pocket-book, a gold pencil case, a silver eye-glass, and a variety of papers, of consequence to me. Within five minutes afterwards, the prisoner came to the street door with a key which she had, and with my child in her arms. I immediately told her to walk in the parlour, and told her that my red box had been stolen out of the drawers, during my absence, and I strongly suspected she must know something about it. She fell down on her knees, and protested her innocence, saying, it was impossible she could have behaved so unkindly to such a master and mistress. I told her that was not at all satisfactory to me, and that I should use every means in my power to find it out. I went out to get an officer, but could not - I desired her to go to bed, and sat up all night, to prevent her having any communication with any one out of the house - I said she had better tell the truth. Next morning, I fetched Clemence, the officer, and gave her in charge. I got a search warrant, and searched the apartments of Harrington and Fowler, and found two letters in a box there, which led me among her connexions at Woolwich - she never told me where to find the box. On Thursday, the 10th, I went to Woolwich, to Bowles, he was not at home, I saw his wife, and the prisoner's sister, Mary Bettelly, I enquired about the box and the contents; they said they knew nothing of it. Mr. Bowles brought me the box on Wednesday, the 16th; it contained 87 l. 16 s. 6 d. then, also a pair of scissars, two silver thimbles, which I could not swear to, but I sell such things - I know the scissars to be mine, and know the box perfectly. On Thursday, the 17th, I attended at Marlborough-street, asked to see the prisoner, and asked her if she knew any thing at all of the robbery, she said,""No, I do not."" I then took the box from my pocket, and shewed it her, I said,""Of course, if you do not know any thing of the robbery, you know nothing of this box, or how I came by it;"" she said,""Oh, yes, I do know of it, I did take it from the drawer, packed it up in a cloth, took it to the coach-office, at Charing-cross, got a direction wrote for it by the bookkeeper, and sent it down to my sister, at Woolwich, to be left at Mrs. Lee's. St. Mary-street."" I asked where the remainder of the property was, which was in the box, she said, she had thrown the pocket-book, the gold pencil-case, the silver eye-glass, and all the papers down the privy. I got a man to search the privy, and saw him find the pocket-book and the eye-glass there, about a week after the robbery.Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The drawer was not locked - A. No; she might suspect I kept my money there, I had locked it in my bed-room on Saturday night, and my wife brought it down in the morning. SARAH ANN LEE . I remember a small box coming to my house, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning of the 7th of January; it was directed to be left at Mrs. Lee's for Mary Bettelly , whom I gave it to a few minutes after. ROBERT BOWLES . I live at Woolwich, and am the prisoner's uncle, by marriage, her sister Mary lived with me. On the 15th of January, she told me there was a box, which came to Mrs. Lee's, directed for her, and that Mrs. Lee had got it. I went to Mrs. Lee, and Mr. Lee brought it to my house in the afternoon and delivered it into Mary's hands. I took it from her and opened it, there was a key tied to the handle, which was broken, and would not open it; I forced it open, and found the money in it - I took it the next morning to Atwell. She was gay and unsteady, but I never heard any complaint of her dishonesty. MARY BETTELLY . I am the prisoner's sister. The box came to Mrs. Lee's for me, my uncle opened it; I did not tell my uncle of it directly, for I was a good deal concerned about it. GUILTY - DEATH .

On Saturday night, about half-past seven o'clock, I was called from the Mansion-house, and found the prisoner with two bundles under his arm; he had asked a person to shew him a pawnbrokers - I asked him what he wanted to pawn, he said a red shawl, to pay for his lodging; I asked how he got the bundles; he said he bought them at Liverpool, three weeks ago; whilst talking to him I saw a piece of stuff packed under his waistcoat; I asked how he came by that; he said he bought it in town, but could not tell where. I found out the prosecutors on Tuesday.(Property produced and sworn to.)Prisoner's Defence. They allowed me to take some of the things to pawn for them. I enquired for a pawnbroker, and was taken.

EZRA GARDINER . I am a grocer, and live in Long-lane, Smithfield, in the parish of St. Sepulchre, and rent the whole house. I went to bed on the 17th of January, about twelve o'clock; my brother was the last person up, but when I went to bed, the outer doors were secured. I had 292 lbs. of black tea, and 114 lbs. of green tea in the stock, at three o'clock in the afternoon, it was in the shop - my silver watch and key hung over the fire place at supper time, I left them there at night. The tea was worth 126 l., and the watch 50 s. - I had 4 l. or 5 l., in loose copper money in the till, I got up a little before seven o'clock in the morning, it was daylight - I had heard no noise in the night, I was the first person that came down. I found the shop door wide open, and a mat against it; no force had been applied, it must have been done with a picklock - the tea was in five chests, three black and two green. On going into the shop, I found the cannisters in disorder, and one of them empty, which was half full when I went to bed. I found the yard door, at the back of the house, had been opened from within, and on going into the yard, I found the yard door, which leads into Three Fox-court, broken open by a crow-bar. I had had it nailed up ever since I had been in the house, it had the marks of a crowbar. I found some person had got over the wall and down on a dust hole, and from there, crept through the iron rails, into my back kitchen window - they could then open the back door of the house, and the shop door. On going into the house again, I found the back parlour had been entered, and from 8 l. to 9 l., in 5 s. papers of copper taken from a desk, which was generally open, the watch also was taken from the same parlour. The prisoner is a strange to me. On going down Three Fox-court, I met a carman, who gave me the till which had been stolen that night, and on going further down the court, I met Okell. The same morning, about eight o'clock, I saw my watch in the possession of Forbes. I saw three bags of tea, of a similar quality to what I lost, and two of the bags are like those in my house, but the tea was not in them in my house; one is a rice bag, and rice was strewed about my shop, and on emptying that bag, I found rice mixed with the tea at the bottom of it - I cannot say whether the kitchen window was secure. ROBERT ARCHER GARDINER . I am brother of the last witness. I went to bed about half an hour after him, and was the last person up. The back parlour and the shop door were secure, I locked the back parlour door myself; the watch was then safe, the clock struck one, as I got into bed, and I thought I heard the back door go; I listened, a quarter of an hour, heard no more, and went to sleep; my brother awoke me at seven o'clock, and I found the things as he has described. JOHN FORBES . I am a constable. The prosecutor's house is in the city. About a quarter before one o'clock in the morning, of the 18th, or the night of the 17th of January, I was at the watch-house, in Cow-cross-street; Okell, the patrol, came to the door with another person, with three bags of tea, which Mr. Gardiner afterwards claimed. I went out with two patrols, without their coats, and on entering the pig-market, I saw the prisoner apparently rising up from one of the pens; I went up and seized him, he made a very strong resistance, and said he would not be taken, for he had done nothing - we took him to the watch-house, as we went, I saw him put his left hand towards his pocket; I told Okell to secure his left hand and I laid hold of his right, we confined both his hands, and took him to the watch-house - upon searching him, we found a watch in his left side breast pocket, which Mr. Gardiner claimed, the glass was broken, but the watch was going - I asked him how he came to carry his watch in that pocket, he made no answer, but said it was his own; I asked the maker's name and number, he said he did not know, and that he had no mark on it - he said there was a person who could describe it, and knew it to be his; he did not name the person, nor produce any such person. In his other pocket, I found a drop latch, a common small box key, and a letter addressed to Mr. C. Marshall, No. 10, Lower Hart-street, Covent Garden. I went to that place the next day, and found the latch key opened the door. I locked him up, and between seven and eight o'clock, saw Mr. Gardiner, and asked him to describe the watch, which he did before I produced it.Cross-examined. Q. How far is the pig-market from the prosecutor's - A. Within one hundred yards - he was up three or four pens. THOMAS OKELL . I am a patrol. I was going my rounds between three and four o'clock, in Three Fox-court, and saw a carman cleaning his horses, and as he took his horses to water, he perceived three bags in his stable, and told me. I took two, and he brought the other to the watch-house with me; my two weighed above 70 lbs.; they contained tea, which Mr. Gardiner claimed in the morning; the other weighed 29 lbs. In the morning, Mr. Gardiner shewed me his premises, the door leading to Three Fox-court, was forced open; that appeared to be the way they had got in. I went with Forbes to the pens in Smithfield, and saw the prisoner there - Forbes's account is correct. I saw the watch taken from his left hand inside coat pocket.Cross-examined. Q. How far was the tea found from the pens - A. Near two hundred yards. The stable is not above twenty yards from Gardiner's.JOHN NEWTON. I am a beadle. Okell brought the tea to the watch-house; it weighed 104 lbs. and a half, with the bags. The prosecutor claimed it. HENRY TURNPENNY . I belong to the day patrol. On the 18th of January, I was sent for, and examined thepremises, which were in the state represented by the watchman. The yard door was forced open with a crow.MR. GARDINER. I find a quantity of rice in one of the bags, there is rice and tea mixed with it now.(Watch produced and sworn to.)Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking in Brick-lane, was returning home, up Sun-street, came across Finsbury-square, along Long-lane, and was taken ill in my bowels; I crossed the pig market, and got into the pens; I found something laying there, picked it carefully up, and saw it was a watch - I put it in my coat pocket, remained there a few minutes, and was buttoning my clothes up, when Forbes came and secured me; all the resistance I made was saying I had done nothing, I did not see why I should go to the watch-house; they took me to the watch-house, and being flurried and agitated, I said the watch was mine. I believe Forbes has stated right. JOHN FORBES re-examined. The watch was in the same state it is now - it was a dry morning; he appeared perfectly sober. I went and examined the pens with a lantern, there was nothing to induce me to suppose he had been there for a necessary occasion; I saw him getting up apparently as if looking round. There was nobody else there. GUILTY - DEATH .

ROBERT CLARK . I produce a hat, which was found on the first floor landing place of the house, in Charles-street, on the night this happened.MRS. THAYER. I know this to be the hat my husband wore on that day. HANNAH PETHICK . In September last, I lived at a house in Charles-street, Drury-lane, kept by Hagerty; the two prisoners lived in the same house, in the two pair of stairs back room; Sarah Brown lived in the two pair front - Hagerty is a bricklayer, and lived in the front parlour,with his wife; two young women lived in the front room, first floor, whose names I do not know; I lived in the two pair back room with the prisoners. I am an unfortunate woman; Burrell is a pensioner. On this night, I met Thayers in Holborn, opposite Southampton-buildings; he spoke to me, he appeared tipsy - I went with him to my lodging; we had drank one glass of liquor each; we reached my room about half-past ten o'clock; he went into the house willingly with me; I took him to the two pair back room, I saw nobody in our way up stairs; when we got into the room, he asked me to cook him some steaks, and gave me sixpence and three halfpence to get them; I went and brought them to him, I was not gone long; when I returned, he was sitting by the fire, in the same room, he asked if I had any bread, I said No, and he gave me half-a-crown to fetch some; I went down stairs, and then saw Burrell in the passage, leading into the street - I asked if he would fetch me some bread, he said, Yes; I gave him the half-crown, and returned to Thayers, he was then sitting in the same place, by the fire; Burrell brought the loaf up, knocked at the door, and gave me the loaf and no change, he could not see who was in the room; he knew I had somebody with me, because I had told him so, when I asked him to fetch it; I then sent Burrell again to fetch a halfpenny worth of salt, he did not bring it - Thayer was sensible enough to know what he was about; in five minutes after, as Burrell did not bring the salt, I went down stairs across to Mr. Ellliot's, where I had sent him for it, and found him there; I told him not to wait for the salt for the man was out of his mind.Q. What made you say so - A. Because Thayer began swearing about his change. Burrell came over into the parlour with me, and gave me the change. Mr. and Mrs. Hagerty and Maria Angel were then in the parlour; Burrell had a white jacket on - Hagerty was undressed in bed; I asked Angel if she would take the change up to the man, as I told her I was afraid he would strike me, she went up with it, and came down almost directly, and said the man had struck her, and she had not given him the change, she gave it to Mrs. Hagerty; Burrell was present, he said nothing; then Mrs. Hagerty went up with the change, and returned, saying, she had given the man his change, and that he was going to strike her - Burrell then went up, Hagerty still remained in bed; I do not know whether he was awake, he did not stir. Burrell asked what business the man had to strike Angel, he seemed angry, and went up stairs - I then heard a noise proceeding from the two pair back room, as if they were fighting; I heard the cry of Murder! and heard them scuffling, I cannot say who it was that called Murder! I was still in the parlour with Mrs. Hagerty and Angel, Hagerty was still in bed; Mrs. Hagerty told me to go for the watch, as she was afraid there would be a piece of work; I went, and first met Birke the watchman, and came back to the house; I had been absent five or six minutes, and before I entered the house, I saw Thayer fall from the two pair of stairs window, I saw him as he came down; he fell on his face flat - I stopped to look at him for about three minutes before I went into the parlour; there was a great crowd, and I could not get in; he remained on the ground till he was taken up - I did not see him move or hear him groan. I went into the front parlour, and found Burrell, Angel, and Mrs. Hagerty there - I did not notice the bed; I saw two children in bed by themselves; Hagerty could not have been in bed then without my seeing him, he was not there; I did not notice whether his clothes were there. I asked Burrell how the man got into the two pair front room, he said he (Burrell) had struck the man because he had struck his girl (Angel) and that the man burst the door open, and threw himself out of window; he said nothing more, Angel said nothing. I remained in the parlour about ten minutes, till Furzman took me away to the watch-house. Burrell was sitting on the table very quiet he had his white jacket on, as before. I saw no more of him or Hagerty.Prisoner, BURRELL. Q. Was Mrs. Hagerty with you when you returned with the watchman - A. No; she and Burrell were in the parlour.COURT. Q. Does the door of the front room come into the staircase - A. Yes, just by our room. The noise of the scuffle appeared to come from the back room; I heard no noise on the stairs. I heard the cry of Murder! but once, and then went for the watchman. I only saw Thayer falling - I did not see him come out of window.Prisoner, BURRELL. Q. Was Sarah Brown 's door broken before that night - A. Yes; but whether it had been mended or not, I cannot say. The bottom hinge was broken a week before; it had an asp to it - I believe the padlock was broken. SARAH BROWN . In September last, I lived at No. 48, Charles-street, in the two pair front room. I left home about a quarter before nine o'clock on that evening, I have only one window to my room, and that I left open - I had no lock to my door, but tied the asp to the staple, with a piece of ribbon. The hinges were sound when I left the room, it had been unnailed before, but was mended by the landlord. I left about half a tub of water under the foot of my bed, quite under the bedstead.Q. If any people had been scuffling in the room, could they have overturned it with moving the bed - A. No. Mine was a turn-up bedstead, but it was down. I returned soon after eleven o'clock, my bed was in the same place as I had left it. Before I got to the house, I had heard something at the end of Charles-street, and on getting up to the house, I found a great number of people round the door; I went into the parlour, which was Hagerty's room; I saw Mrs. Hagerty and the two prisoners in the parlour, Hagerty was not in bed - I said I heard some man had been thrown out of window, Mrs. Hagerty said,""Oh my G - d, I am an undone woman, my husband has ran away half undressed, at the alarm of a man being thrown from your window;"" I then accused Angel of having opened my door, and taken the man into my room; I said,""You have taken the man into my room, I suppose on purpose that it should be laid to me;"" I said I did not know what I should do, but I thought I had better go down to Furzman, because they might think I knew something about it, and I would go to him to know whether they had told him I was not at home; Burrell said,""It is nonsense Maria and you having and words; the man ran from Maria's room, burst open your door, and threw himself out of window"" - I went to the street door, and then returned to the parlour; the prisoners and Mrs. Hagerty were still there; I said""They say the man is dead,"" Burrell said,""Dead!"" I said,""Yes, so they say,""Burrell seemed greatly agitated, but said nothing more, he left the room; he had a light jacket on, I had seen him in that dress before; I do not know which part of the house he went to, but I saw him come down stairs into the passage in two or three minutes; he then had a blue close coat, and his hat on, his coat was buttoned up - I cannot say whether he had the jacket on, it was not a working jacket, it was a linen waistcoat with sleeves, a coat might be put over it; his hat was not on when he went up stairs. I went out and never saw the deceased; I returned about a quarter before two o'clock, got a light, and went to my room, and found the door forced from the bottom hinge, the hinge was broken, and the door forced back, part of the wood work was broken, it opens inward, the staple and asp were as I had left it. The water tub was behind the door; there had been a great many people in the room before me. I saw several spots of blood about the room, some by the side of the window ledge, and two or three spots on the ledge - I saw the print of finger marks of blood three steps down the staircase from my door. The water in the tub was dirty dish water, it was empty, and turned up behind the door, about three yards from the bed. I never saw Burrell go out in the street in the light jacket. I am an unfortunate woman.COURT. Q. Did you know the room Pethick slept in - A. Yes; there is a window to it which leads into the yard; I do not know whether it was open; nobody could get into the yard without going through the passage of the house. There is no carpet to my room - I observed no scratches on the floor. The water was all thrown out of the tub over the floor. I found the bed in the same place as I left it - somebody must have taken the tub from under it, for scuffling about would not overturn it. I did not go to Furzman. ROBERT CLARK . I am a constable of St. Giles's. About half-past ten o'clock, on the night of the 24th of September, I saw Pethick speaking to Birke the watchman. I followed her down to Charles-street, and Birke went down at a quick pace; in a minute or two, I heard a rattle spring, I went down the street, and found the deceased lying with his head in the kennel; I snatched a candle out of somebody's hand, went up stairs, and on the first floor landing, I saw Bartlett pick up the hat, and on the same landing there were spots of blood from there, up to the two pair of stairs front room window, there was also a mark of blood in the hat, quite fresh - I found the door of the room broken off the hinge, it hung by the top hinge, and pushed inward into the room; the asp was open - I did not notice the wood work. In the centre of the room, between the bedstead and the wainscot, a tub stood with some water in it and some was spilt about a yard from the bed - it struck me there had been some rough work there; I found blood on the cill of the window; I went into the back room on that floor, and found some meat which appeared to have been lately dressed, and a loaf torn all to pieces, the place was in great confusion; I then called out of window to them to take care of the deceased. I searched every room in the house, and did not find a soul; I immediately came down and asked who had brought the man into the house, Pethick was delivered to me. I went to the hospital with the man, returned, and found Furzman there, he took Angel and Mrs. Hagerty into custody. I took Angel to the watch-house, and asked her how she could use the man in that manner, she said she went up to the man for money for the room, that the man went to hit her, and her young man struck him. The spots of blood were quite fresh on the floor, window cill, stairs, and hat. I did not go into the parlour before I went up stairs.COURT. Q. How high is the window from the floor - A. About three feet, and about twenty-one from the ground - there are no area rails. I think the back room window was shut; I could not get to the window without turning round the end of the bed; it comes down nearly to the window. There are about sixteen stairs in the second flight. JOHN BIRKE . I am a watchman. I was in Charles-street, on this night. A woman about the size of Pethick, called Watch! I went to a house in Charles-street, and just as I got to the door the man fell from the window on the pavement, on his face and hands. I sprang my rattle, turned the man over, and saw water on his face, and water came from his nose; I saw the two pair front window open; I remained with the man till Clark came and went in - there was a good many people collected in the street; I cannot say that I saw anybody come out of the house as I went up, I saw blood on the stairs; I saw no blood on the first landing, but on about three steps from the second flight, I saw no more blood till I came to the cill of the window; the room door was open - I saw the hat found. The water was spilt about the room. THOMAS BARTLETT . I am street-keeper of Drury-lane. Clark called me - I went to the house, and saw a woman named Fox, standing at the door with a candle in her hand, Clark took the candle from her, and went up stairs, I followed him; I had seen the deceased laying on his face, in the street; as we went up, I observed spots of blood on the one pair staircase, four or five steps up, and by the door of the front room, of the one pair landing - I picked up the hat produced, I saw a spot or two of blood inside it, and spots of blood on the second flight of stairs; it was fresh then, no person had been up except us; I traced the blood into the middle of the two pair front room, it was in different parts of the room, not in a regular trace. I went to the window after taking the man to the hospital, and saw blood on the cill. A tub of water had been upset, and the room was in great confusion. I went into the back room, there had been some beef steaks cooked, and ready on the table; I noticed nothing more there. We searched the house all over, and could find no person up stairs; on coming down, I saw Mrs. Hagerty at the door, Angel was present, I said,""Mrs. Hagerty, I insist on your telling me who was the person that brought the man home,"" she said it was Pethick, who was brought forward, and taken into custody. I took the deceased to the hospital. The table was upset, and the chairs about. SAMUEL FURZMAN . I am an officer. On the night of the 24th of September, in consequence of information, I went to No. 48, Charles-street, and found Thayer laying on his back; Clark gave Pethick into my custody - I went to the hospital with the man, and after taking Pethick to the watch-house, returned, went into the parlour, and saw Mrs. Hagerty, Angel, and a man sitting on the table. I cannot say who he was, or how he was dressed - I asked Mrs. Hagerty where her husband was, she said,""Gone tothe hospital with the man."" I told her to come up stairs with me; I examined the place, and saw several marks of blood on the stairs, I cannot say whether there was any blood in the two pair back, but there was in the two pair front room, which was in great confusion; the door was off the hinges, and there was a tub in the middle of the room, which appeared to have been upset, and water spilt - some chairs and a table stood in the room. I went to the window ledge, the window was open and a spot or two of blood on it. Mrs. Hagerty afterwards said, in Angel's presence, that Angel had been up stairs with the change to the man, and that he struck her. I then took Mrs. Hagerty and Angel to the watch-house - Angel said she had been up stairs with the change which Pethick gave her, that the man had struck her, and had also attempted to strike Mrs. Hagerty - I have made a diligent search for Hagerty, and travelled many miles, but cannot find him.COURT. Q. Was the blood in different places, or a regular tract - A. It was in broken patches. JOHN SCOTT . I am a police officer. I took Burrell into custody, on the 4th of October, at Chelsea College, in the pay-office, in consequence of information I received. I told him I took him on a serious charge, for heaving a man out of window, in Charles-street, Drury-lane. He seemed very much agitated - I think he had a blue coat and yellow buttons on; he said he was innocent of any charge. I said he must go with me, he came along very quietly, and on going up George-street, Chelsea, he said again he was innocent; I said,""Then why did you abscond, if you are innocent;"" he said, his mother wished him, for fear he should be taken. He said he had been in Union-street, Borough, I think he said Star-court. His right eye was tied up with a handkerchief, I said,""What is the matter with your eye,"" he said he had some sand thrown into it. I asked him why he should disguise himself; he said, because he should receive his pension unnoticed, he used some other expression, which I do not recollect. I had not handcuffed him at that time, he took the handkerchief off his eye himself, and said,""Never mind, I will tell the Magistrate all about it"" - there was nothing the matter with his eye, I took him to the watch-house. JOHN SWEATMAN . I am the house-surgeon at the Middlesex hospital. Thayer was brought in on the 24th of September, about eleven or twelve o'clock at night. I saw him immediately, he was insensible; he had an extensive wound on the right hand side of his forehead, by contusion; it would happen by a blow from a blunt instrument, or by a fall - he partly recovered his senses on the following day, when I saw him, at ten o'clock in the morning, but not sufficiently to give me an account of the accident. On the second day, I questioned him; I cannot say whether he apprehended death to be near, he complained of a pain in his head, nothing else at that time - he afterwards complained of a pain in his right hip, and down the thigh. I examined him, and found bruises on the hind and fore part of the thigh, but no wound - the bruises on his hip were treated as slight bruises, the pain in his head subsided in a few days, and when that had almost subsided, he had an attack of the St. Anthony's fire, in his face, that very commonly follows a wound on the head. This went off very soon, returned in about two days, and subsided again. He had an attack shortly afterwards, of an inflamation in his right lung; he had then been in the hospital about ten days, and two or three days after, this was followed by an inflamation in the bowels. St. Anthony's fire naturally follows a wound in the head, and on dissection, the inflamation of the bowels was accounted for, by a fractured bone; the inflamation of the lung, I cannot distinctly relate to the accident; it might be produced by other causes. After being in the hospital three months, he left, was out of the hospital three weeks, and then returned; he was then too far gone to make any complaints, he was sinking under his disorder, and died in a few days. I opened his body, in the presence of Mr. Ogle - I first opened the head; the only diseased appearance there, was an unusual collection of water in the cavities of the brain; there was evidence of the inflamation of the right lung, and there was a scrofulous disease extending through both lungs, and marks of inflamation having existed in the bowels some time before; the right haunch-bone was broken across, the fracture extended across the hip joint, and a sharp piece of the broken bone extended into the cavity of the abdomen; and from this projecting piece, an abscess, containing about a pint of matter, extended six or eight inches along the spine - the hip joint itself was sound, this was the only diseased appearance.Q. From your knowledge of all his symptoms, to what do you ascribe his death - A. To the fever produced by this abscess, which was occasioned by the confusion of the of the pointed bone projecting out.Q. He never ceased complaining from the first - A. He was never able to walk without crutches, and then with a great deal of pain - a fall from a two pair of stairs window might occasion the fracture.MR. OGLE. I am a surgeon. I attended the dissection of the deceased's body, with the last witness; I saw him a few days after his discharge from the hospital, in the parochial infirmary, he always complained of the same injury; Mr. Sweatman's account is very correct. I have nothing to add, except that the proximate cause of the man's death, arose from the quantity of water in the cavity of the brain; inflamation often follows a blow or fall, and the water, I think was produced by inflamation, that is the common case. The blood vessels of the head were fuller than ordinary.Q. Mr. Sweatman says the abscess might cause his death - A. It assisted, certainly, death was occasioned by the effect of the abscess and water on the head jointly. The blow on the head would produce inflamation, which terminated in an abscess. I have no doubt but the fall from the window produced his death.BURRELL - GUILTY. Aged 32.Of Manslaughter only .

On the 14th of January, about half-past nineo'clock at night, I was in Hemming's-row, just by Leicester-square, the prisoner and another girl came up on each side, and asked me to go with them, I refused; the prisoner then asked if I would give them something to drink - by that time, I had got nearly in the middle of the row, and when I refused, the prisoner made a jump at my breast, laid hold of my brooch, and tore it from my shirt; she tore my shirt, it was done in an instant. Immediately after the grasp, I received a blow on the left side of my head, I cannot say who from - I turned round, and a gentleman said""Take care of your watch, Sir.""

On the 9th of February, I was in Marmont-street, St. George's in the East, going to my factory, and just as I came to a cross bar in the street, three persons came across from the opposite side, and appeared to wish to go through the posts before me. I stepped back to let them pass, they faced about immediately, and stopped me between the posts, blocking me up between the posts; both put their hands on me, stopped me, and held me while the prisoner laid hold of my seals. I put my hands down and caught the watch, the chain broke, but he got the seals, and the man who was on my right, gave way, for him to go through the posts - he got the seals quite away. I am sure he is the man, it was dark; I turned round, he ran up the middle of the road, calling Stop thief! and kept him in view till he was secured; I have not found them.

JAMES HAMILTON . I live in Princes-street, High Holborn, and am a hairdresser. On the 17th of January, I went up stairs, for about ten minutes, and when I came down, I happened to go out at the door, and saw the glass of the window cut or broken; it was quite dark.

No; I saw them weighed within a few yards of the boat. JOHN ALDRIDGE . I am master of Mr. Bache's boat, No. 8. I received a load in the boat, in December, I brought it safe to London, as they were given to me; I delivered the cargo to Morris, at Paddington wharf. The whole cargo was right. FRANCIS MORRIS . I am warehouse keeper to Mr. Bache, at Paddington. The boat No. 8, I received on the 28th of December; among other packages, there were two marked L. J. 9 and 10, which were sent the same day to the warehouse in Moor-lane, by Kettel and Cummings; I delivered them as I received them.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How did you receive them - A. I called the mark over, and checked it. GEORGE KETTEL . I am a servant to Mr. Bache. On the 28th of December, I took part of a load from Paddington to Moor-lane, there were two bales among it, I do not recollect the marks. We delivered part of the load at different places by the way, and took the rest to Moor-lane.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You deliver them according to your directions - A. Yes; the book-carrier delivers them. JOSEPH CUMMINGS . I am guard to the waggon. I recollect on the 28th of December, taking a load of goods with the waggon, from Paddington, to Moor-lane. There were some packages there, I do not recollect the marks or numbers. We delivered part in Moor-lane, to Stephen Haines. STEPHEN HAYNES . I am in the employ of Mr. Bache, at the warehouse, in Moor-lane. Cochrane was guard to one of the waggons; Atkinson was waggoner; Cork was an in-door porter to Mr. Bache; Cochrane and Atkinson's duty was to carry out goods, and bring them to the warehouse; Cork had access to the warehouse, in Moor-lane. I have a memorandum which was made at Paddington, and brought to me by Cummings, it is an entry of L. J. 9 and 10, (reads)"" Abraham Turner 's order, two packages, L. J. 9 and 10;"" Cumming and Kettel delivered it to me with the goods; the two packages L. J. 9 and 10, were delivered me by them, and stowed in our warehouse, in Moor-lane - I checked them off as being delivered. It is my business to take an account of goods coming in and going out. On the 21st of January, we had an order from Lawrence and Jolland's for goods, and found there ought to be such packages in the warehouse - I entered them in the carrier's book for Ansford to take them. No. 10, weighed 2 cwt.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Who wrote this paper - A. One Huggins, he is not here. I saw those very packages, nine or ten days after they were brought. If Ansford had not called them over, I should not have checked them off. The guard delivers goods on the road, but when brought to the warehouse, he has nothing to do with them. The waggoner is under the direction of the guard, to whom the bill is delivered. The goods in Moor-lane, are in my care; I lock up, about eight o'clock, and keep the keys. When we are short of hands, the waggoner is employed in the warehouse. We have watchmen at night, and when I am absent in the day, I have a substitute.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Would Cochrane have to load and unload - A. If he had time; his duty is generally out of doors; he did not guard these goods to Moor-lane.MR. ANDREWS. Q. When goods are to be taken from Moor-lane, the waggon is brought there - A. Yes; but they generally take from there direct to Paddington - they are generally loaded by Cork, Lord, and Ansford. If they are to be delivered in town, the waggon comes into the warehouse, and the goods are lowered into it - Cork would be one of the persons to do that. Ansford calls them over, and I tick them off, which enables me to say they came into the warehouse. WILLIAM ANSFORD . I am porter to Mr. Bache, in Moor-lane. On the 28th of December, I remember the goods arriving, I called them over to Haines, who ticked them off; they were put in a loft up one pair of stairs. An order came from Lawrence and Co., on the 21st of January, I looked for the packages, and found No. 9 and 10, were gone. I put them away together.JOHN CORT re-examined. I find by my book that No. 10, contained eighty-four pieces of muslin, each measuring twenty yards. SUSAN SMITH . I live in Tenter-street, Little Moorfields, over some stables; I have lately lost my husband, he dealt in wool. I have known Cochrane almost all my life. In December last, he was in Mr. Bache's employ; I had seen Atkinson driving a waggon, with Cochrane in the street, before Christmas - I first knew Cork, six or seven months ago, I then saw him in the street with my husband. I have a servant named Jane Barber . I slept in Wilmot-street, Brunswick-square, on the 9th or 10th of January, at Mr.Morris's. I had been to the play with Mr. Morris and his wife, and slept there all night; he is no relation of mine, they lodge there. I have a brother named Smith, who is now indicted.Q. Did you, next morning, take away any goods from there - A. Yes. I went home in a coach, and took them with me - the goods had been in the passage at Morris's house.Q. When you went to Morris's did you expect any goods to be there - A. No; the goods were lifted into the coach by Morris and my brother. When I got home, I opened them, and found they contained muslins, they were corded up in coarse wrappers - I did not notice whether they had been opened before. There was a mark on the wrapper, in ink, I did not notice the figures or letters. My brother went home with me in the coach; he got out at the end of Old Jewry - I went on in the coach to Tenter-street, with the goods, and put them in my passage; I got home a little past nine o'clock in the morning, and my brother came home in about half an hour. Barber and I helped him to take the goods up stairs, into the sitting room, it was opened there, and contained from sixty to sixty-five pieces of muslin; I left them in the room without packing them up again. About an hour after this, Cochrane came, the girl might be in the room, and if she was, I sent her out - Cochrane said he wanted 73 l. for the muslins; I said I I could not tell what I could give for them, until I saw what they would fetch; my brother, Smith, was present at this conversation. Cochrane said he should send his wife for some for her own use; he went away, leaving the goods, and my brother went out - I did not look at the packages when they were at my house, to see the marks of them. Cochrane's wife came in about an hour or two, and took two fine pieces and another coarse, this was either on a Wednesday or Thursday. Cochrane called again the same day, and said if either of the other two men should call with him, I was to say I was only to give 40 l. for them. On Saturday night Cochrane, came with Atkinson, whom I had seen in his company in the street before, and am sure he is the man; Cochrane said to him,""These are the goods, and Mrs. Smith is to give 40 l. for them,"" Atkinson said,""Very well,"" they went away; I think my girl let them in that day - they were in the bed-room where the muslin was. Cochrane called in the course of the next week, to know if I had any money, I told him I had not, I had told him his wife had had three pieces, he said, very well - his wife afterwards came, I gave her 8 l. I afterwards told him she had 8 l., he said, very well; he called several times for money, and I paid him 6 l., he and his wife had in all 28 l. at different times - I thought it was 30 l., but it was counted up, and was only 28 l. On the Sunday after, before I was taken to prison, on the Monday, I saw Cork at my house, it was on the 27th of January, Cochrane was with him; we went into the bed-room, Cochrane said,""Mistress how much money have you paid?"" I said 30 l. Cork said,""That is, right Mistress; I thought Robert was on the shuffle"" - my husband's sister was there at the time, but not in the bed-room. Cochrane went away, and Cork stopped and had some ale with my brother, who was at home, but not in the bed-room - Cork called several times at my house, and enquired for my brother, but nothing passed about the goods. My brother lived with me, he was a pawnbroker's servant out of place. I paid 28 l. in all; there was one 5 l. Bank note among it; I pledged some of the goods, (two parcels) at Mr. Sowerby's, Chiswell-street, for 1 l. 10 s., and sent some to be pledged by my servant; I think she only pawned two pieces. I know Mrs. Bowers she pawned some for me. I offered some to a gentleman one morning for sale, I asked him 30 s. a piece for the fine, and 20 s. for the coarse. I know Forster, I told him I had goods to sell, and he said he would send a gentleman to look at them.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Your's is a room over a stable - A. Yes; I have two rooms, one leads to the other. My brother lived with me; I have two beds in one room, and a turn-up one in another - I do not know where my brother is; I did not give him notice to be off - I have not seen him since the morning I was taken to prison - he was to receive no part of the money for them, nor pay any part, he only lifted them in the coach. I was only put to the bar once at the office; I was taken there three times, as a criminal. I did not know that my brother was off when I became a witness. I had no communication with any body. Cochrane shewed Atkinson the goods, and said,""These are the goods,"" he said, very well. I do not know whether my servant saw Atkinson.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How much did you raise on the muslins which you pawned - A. I do not know; I gave the officer all the duplicates. I went to the play with Mr. and Mrs. Morris, and next morning, Morris came up, and said George had left a large bundle in the passage, and George came up to me, he said he had them from Cochrane, and he was coming to my house to look at them - it was bulky, I did not know the contents till I got home, I did not conceal it.Q. Might not conversation in one of your rooms be heard in the other - A. Not without paying particular attention. I told the officers of it directly they came to my house. I was not so much surprised to find muslin in it, as I might have been. I gave Cochrane's wife a 5 l. note, which I had saved for my rent; I mentioned this at Guildhall.MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you send the servant out of the room - A. No; she was in the sitting room - I went into the bed room. I have been in custody ever since. I have had no promise that I shall not be prosecuted. THOMAS MORRIS . I live in Wilmot-street, Brunswick-square. About the 9th or 10th of January, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, some goods were brought to my house, packed in a large parcel, in canvas; it was brought by a waggon which stopped at my door, three men brought it. I did not notice any name on the waggon. I cannot swear either of the prisoners are the men, but I believe Cochrane was one of them; I had seen him before.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What are you - A. An attorney's clerk. George Smith was one of the persons who left it - I knew him very well, he came to the door with it, I took it in, as it was left by him, it was merely brought into my passage - I had no previous communication about it. Smith asked if I would suffer him to leave it at my house, and I consented - he has absconded.COURT. Q. Did it require more than one person to bring it in - A. I think two, for it was very heavy. Smithcame at nine o'clock for it, and went away with Mrs. Smith in a coach; I helped to lift it in the coach - it was brought about half-past six o'clock, it was then dark, I was sitting up, writing. ELIZA ANN SMITH . I am sister-in-law to Mrs. Smith. I have seen the prisoner, Cochrane and Cork before - I have seen Cochrane at Mrs. Smith's once; it was on a Sunday, the day before she was taken up. I saw Cork there the same day in the afternoon, when I went, and Cochrane came while Cork was there.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. What time did you go there - A. Between three and four o'clock. I went away, returned, and then Cochrane was there, he did not stop above a minute, he came about six o'clock, went into the parlour, but did not stop - I am the sister of George Smith . JANE BARBER . I lived servant with Mrs. Smith, in Tenter-street, for six or seven months, till she was taken up; she went to the play on Wednesday evening, and slept out that night, she had slept out twice, the last time was on the Wednesday evening - she came home about nine o'clock in the morning, in a coach. George Smith had slept in the house that Wednesday night; there was a very great parcel in the coach when Mrs. Smith came home, it was taken out and taken up stairs into the bedroom - George Smith , my mistress, and I carried it up, George Smith had got up very early this morning, between five and six o'clock, for a knock came at the door. I went down to answer it, but my light went out; I did not open it, but asked who it was, and a voice, which I took to be Cochrane's, asked if George was at home. I had seen him before, and believed it to be his voice. I called Mr. Smith, went to bed again, and he went out - it was between five and six o'clock. About an hour after the parcel was brought, Cochrane came, the door was open, he went into the parlour, my mistress and George Smith were there; they stopped in the parlour for about an hour. I did not hear what passed, the parcel had been in the bedroom, but was afterwards taken into the parlour, it was in the parlour before Cochrane came. I saw Cochrane go out with George Smith , I did not go into the parlour while they were there. Before the parcel came, I had seen Cork and Cochrane at my mistress's house, the other is quite a stranger to me - I had seen them more than once before the parcel came, I had seen Cochrane four or five times before, and Cork two or three times.Q. Had you been desired by your mistress to pawn any goods for her - A. Yes; the first thing was some of her wearing apparel, this was before the parcel was brought; after it was brought, I pledged about three pieces of muslin, for 1 l. each - she told me to take them to Mr. Sowerby, at the corner of Finsbury-street, and I pawned them there - I took one parcel to Attenborough's.Q. Did you know of any woman coming to your mistress - A. I have seen Mrs. Cochrane there, on the morning the goods came; she took away about three pieces of muslin - I do not know Fenton, Christopher Atkinson and Smith were at the house when the goods were there.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. When the knock came, you was outside - A. Yes; I did not tell the Magistrate that it was his voice, nor that Mrs. Cochrane took away any muslin, I was not asked. I have seen my mistress three times, I do not think I have talked with her about this - I cannot say whether she has spoken to me about Mrs. Cochrane; I was with her a quarter of an hour each time, and spoke to her to-day for about five minutes - I believe Cochrane was acquainted with my mistress.MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have seen your mistress in Giltspur-street Compter, three times - A. Yes; I could not hear what Cochrane said to my mistress when he came, I heard talking in the room. JOHN HORN . In consequence of information I received, I went to Mrs. Smith's house on the 28th of January, and she shewed me some jaconot muslins; I took two patterns of them, which I produce; they were in the front room, there were twenty pieces. JOHN LACY HAWKINS . I am a marshalman. I went to Mrs. Smith's on the 28th of January, and found a quantity of muslins; Horn cut patterns of two of them - I found nine duplicates of muslins, pawned at different pawnbroker's, in a cash-box, in her parlour, I think it was locked. Mrs. Morris gave me one or two pieces, at her house, in Wilmot-street. MARY ANN BOWERS . Mrs. Smith employed me to pawn muslin for her two or three times - I pawned them at Matthews's, Attenborough's, and Barker's, (looks at the duplicates), these are what I got for them, it was on the 10th, 12th, and 22d of January - I pawned them in the name of Smith. THOMAS SOWERBY . (Looks at some duplicates), These are mine; they are dated the 10th and 12th of January. I produce the goods answering to them - I believe Mrs. Smith pawned one of them, they are both pawned in her name - I advanced 2 l. 10 s., and 1 l. on them. GEORGE ATTENBOROUGH . Here are two duplicates of mine, I produce the goods, they were pledged for 1 l. 5 s. and 2 l. 10 s.; here is another duplicate, of the 19th of January, pawned by Bowers, for 25 s. THOMAS MATTHEWS .

Here are two duplicates, both dated the 22d of January, for muslin pawned for 2 l. each, in the name of Smith. JOHN BURD . I am captain of Mr. Bache's boat, the Defiance. About the 21st of January, I met Cochrane, at Paddington, by Pickford's warehouses; he asked me if I had met his waggon, I said, No. He said he thought the waggon had been come, and that he had been into the town, to carry a great deal of money for Mr. Bache; he put his hand to his side-pocket, and shewed me a great quantity of sovereigns, there was a handful of sovereigns. STEPHEN HAYNES , re-examined. Cochrane had some talk with me about money, about the time the muslin was missed; he came to me and said, he had been extremely fortunate, that he had found a purse, containing a sum of money; I asked how much, he said there was some sovereigns in it. I asked him if there was any bills in it, to lead to a discovery of the owner, he said, Yes; there was a bill; I asked if it was a bill of exchange, he seemednot to understand me; I asked if it was a Bank of England note, he said it was very much like one, that he found it near the London Docks - I advised him to have it advertized, he said he would look at the papers and see if the owner had advertized it. I cautioned him not to make an extravagant use of it; he said he would not, and that he had handed it over to his wife. About a week or ten days after, we had a further conversation; he said it contained more than he had told me. I asked him what, he said it contained a bill of 10 l., payable at the Bank of England, but not a Bank note, and that it had been out for three or four years, that his brother had taken it, and it was paid without hesitation - he had 32 s. a week.(Property produced and sworn to.)COCHRANE'S Defence. I can account for the money. My master sent me to Charing-cross, for twenty-one sovereigns; I often had 30 l. of his money. The money I spoke to Haynes about I found the Sunday before Christmas-day; as I was going to Limehouse. I told him to look in the papers for an advertisement - it was as hard for me to get the goods, as to break from this bar.Atkinson put in a written defence, denying the charge, and stating that the guard always directed him to deliver the packages.COCHRANE - GUILTY .

t18220220-32,kill,murder,death,none,18220220,"357 WILLIAM ABBOTT was indicted for the wilful murder of Mary Lees . ANN SMITH . On the 9th of February, I lived in the house kept by the prisoner, at No. 41, George-street, St. Giles's. I knew the deceased, Mary Lees . She first came to live with the prisoner as his wife, about four years ago. On the evening of the 9th of February, between six and seven o'clock, or rather later, she asked me to feel her eye; the prisoner was sitting by the fire, smoking his pipe. I felt her eye - it was very much bruised all down her face. She said, in his presence, that William had done it through her wanting to take some money to the landlord. She said,""I have got 5 s."" I said,""You had better take it up."" She said,""If I do not go up to-night I cannot go in the morning, for I owe him so much money."" The prisoner said,""I will serve you ten times worse if you do not hold your noise."" He then kicked her several times about the legs, and said he would serve me as bad as her. She went out with the 5 s., as I understood, to take it to the landlord, who lives in the neighbourhood. I sat in the room; I was in and out in the course of the evening, until two o'clock, when she returned from paying the landlord. The prisoner asked her for sixpence; she said she had not got it; and, using very bad expressions; he said, if his father and mother came out of their graves, he would kill her that night; he up with one hand, and had a pipe in the other, and he dashed her down, stood with the pipe in his hand, and with all his force, stamped on her belly several times. I said,""Do'nt, William, do'nt do that."" He said, if I offered to pick her up, he would serve me worse than her. I being very ill, dare not get up, for fear he should knock me down. She lay there about a quarter of an hour, and was very stiff; she put out her hand and asked me to pull her up; she got up herself by a chair, and he came from the fire-place, kicked her several times on the legs and hurt his bad leg; and repeated, that if his mother and father came out of their graves he would kick her ten times worse. I asked her to go and have a glass of gin, as she was so ill - she was quite sober. We went to Mr. Peach's in Church-lane, and she called for a quartern of rum; it was not many steps off; three of us drank the rum between us; and when we got back he was sitting by the fire smoking his pipe - he took her by her two arms, dashed her against the bedstead, and said she had been spending his money. She said she would give him a pot of beer if he wanted it, and sent for one for him; after he drank it, she went to Peach's again and had half a pint of beer herself - I went with her - she could not drink it, and I did. I cannot tell what time this was, as there was no clock; I was there till one o'clock in the morning, staying in the room. When we came back from Peach's again, he took her and dashed her against a fender with all his force. I never saw him more severe in his life; and as she lay on the floor, he said, he did not care if his father and mother came from their graves he would kill her that night. She lay on the fender a good while; when she got up, she said something had had burst on her right side, putting her hand to the top of her neck. Morris came in then; I cannot say what time it was, but when I went out for the gin, I met the patrol, and wanted her to give charge of him; she said,""No, I won't, and I shall not be obliged to any one else who does.""Q. Were you present when any thing passed about herpockets - A. When she lay on the floor, before she was thrown on the fender; he had taken her by her arms and dashed her on the coals, which lay in the corner of the room by the side of the bed; she lay on her back and fainted; she was quite stiff; I thought she was dead. He cut her pockets off, as she lay there, put them into his coat pocket, and sat down; and then she got up by the chair, as I said before. She said, he has got all my money, and sat down on the chair. I asked her if she would go to bed; she said, yes - and then I put her on the bed, without undressing her; - he took her by her arms and dashed her down on the floor; (this was the time he dashed her on the fender.) After he got her pockets he went out, and then came back again and sat by the fire smoking; she went and sat by him. Mr. Morris came in and fetched her some raw beef to put to her eye. I then went to bed; it was then, I think, between one and two o'clock. She never struck or offered to strike him, or did any thing to him. She called him one very bad name after he struck her. She was a thin woman, and had been very ill; she was tall but not strong.COURT. Q. Was the prisoner drunk - A. No; he appeared to have been drinking - I slept in the garret.Q. How came you so long in the room - A. My knee was so bad I could hardly move - I boarded with the prisoner, and only slept up stairs; I am an unfortunate woman - I had no quarrel with the prisoner; I saw him at breakfast, he appeared very severe then.Prisoner. Q. Will you swear I knocked her down at all - A. Yes. A young man and woman lodge in the back room; four or five people lodge in the house, they were all out at the time.JURY. Q. When you went to bed, did you leave them sitting by the fire - A. Yes; and she had her eye tied up. LAVINIA NICHOLLS . I lodge in the one pair front room of this house. Lees, alias Duggan, lived with the prisoner as his wife, in the parlour; nobody else slept in that room - my room is over the prisoner's. On Saturday night, the 9th of February, I had been at home all day, and about seven o'clock, I heard a noise in the parlour where they lived - I went into Long-acre for somesugar; got back very near eight o'clock, and before I got to the door I heard violent screams from the woman - I went into the parlour, and found her and the prisoner there; she was lying down on the floor, on her back - the prisoner was with his left hand leaning on the table, kicking her on the belly; he did it several times with great violence - when I went in, she said,""Mrs. Nicholls, shelter me from this villain, for he will kill me."" I said, he should not ill use her, and got between them - he said, if I interfered, he would serve me the same way - I then desisted, got the woman from the ground, and got her into a chair; she cried out several times, in a low tone, as if she was hurt - she fainted away in the chair - he was sitting down by the fire, and did not help her; he did nothing. Ann Smith came in while she was fainting, which lasted five or six minutes - I gave her water, but she could not take it - when she recovered, I assisted her to a chair, and placed her by the fire; I saw the side of her left eye was very black, and swollen - I had seen him kick her there; he kicked her on the stomach, and on the head - I noticed the blackness, she said, in his presence, he had kicked her there, and that she felt very ill in her inside.Q. What time was this - A. About eight o'clock when I went in, and I stopped there till about eleven o'clock; I got him quite peaceable, and then went to bed - he went to sleep by the fire, and she went to sleep in her chair, with her head against the wall. I remained awake; she groaned very much when asleep - I left Morris and Smith there. After I got into bed I heard a noise in the prisoner's room; I got up and went in again, and found Smith and Morris there. I believe it was between twelve and one o'clock; they were peaceable - Abbot was sitting by the fire, smoking; I went to bed in five or six minutes, and was not disturbed in the night. About eight o'clock in the morning I went out on an errand; on coming back, I went into Abbott's room, and saw him and Morris there; when I came to the door, I heard him turn from the bedside, and say,""D - n her eyes, she is dead"" - I went to the bed side, and saw her lying on her right side, quite cold; she was dead; he turned away and sat by the fire, and said,""Well, she is dead, they can only have to bury her."" I remained in the room till Bartlett came and took the prisoner away - he did not attempt to get away; I do not think that he knew Bartlett was sent for.COURT. Q. How long had you lived there - A. Only five days. My husband is sergeant of the 90th regiment, and is at Malta; I am from Manchester, where the regiment had been, and being a stranger in town, I went there to lodge, without knowing what place it was - I came here to get sent to Malta, but was bound over to appear here. The deceased was a tall, thin, spare, delicate woman; she gave no offence to him.Prisoner. Q. Did we not have tea comfortable that evening - A. I did not see them at tea.Q. Did you not take a man up stairs, and sleep with him. - A. It is false. EDWARD MORRISON . I lived at this house, in February, in the back garret. I came home on this night, between twelve and one o'clock; all was quiet then. I went into the parlour to pay my rent. Abbott was asleep by the fire; Lees shewed me her black eye, and said, she had been used very ill. I got a piece of beef, and came back to her; the prisoner was still asleep - I put the beef to her eye; she went out of the room, and I stopped there - she returned in about ten minutes; Abbott was then awake - she sat on a chair, he got up, pulled her off the chair, threw her on the floor, and stamped his foot upon her several times, and kicked her about the body; she lay upon her left side; I do not know on which side he kicked her. I lifted her up, and put her to bed; she remained there a short time, and then he again threw her on the floor, kicked, and stamped his feet on her several times - he used a bad expression, and said, he wished he could kick her more without hurting his leg; I did all I could to hinder him, but he fell on her with such violence, I could not get between them time enough - I then lifted her upon the bed a second time. I never heard her speak again; it might then be between two and three o'clock or later - I had no watch.Q. Did she, while you were there, give him the least provocation, either by word or action - A. Not the least - when I put her on the bed a second time, something came from her, through his kicking her, as I thought, and he said,""the **** has **** the bed;"" he then dragged her off again, and kicked her - I told him he would kill her;he said, if he did, he would take her to Brooks's next morning, making use of a bad expression; Brooks is a surgeon, in Gray's-inn-lane, as I understood. The servant girl came into the room, helped me to get her clothes off, and got her into bed a third time - I never heard her speak afterwards; I sat by the fire all night, and about six o'clock in the morning, I heard a ratling noise in her throat - I heard her breathe afterwards; I took the ratling noise to be her sobbing and crying.Q. What induced you to remain in the room - A. He sat up all night; I remained there, because she asked me to stop there to prevent his beating her. I left the room about a quarter before eight o'clock; I then thought she was asleep. Nicholls was comingin as I was going out; I believing her to be asleep, told her not to disturb her - Nicholls had been in the room before that, went out for something, and then came back again.COURT. Q. What are you - A. A wheeler. I never had any quarrel with him; I had been there three weeks.Q. Why did you not call for assistance - A. I prevented him myself, then he was quiet for a short time, and then went at her again. I understood the watch had been called several times before, but she would never give him in charge.Prisoner. Q. Did not she begin first - A. She did not give him an angry word in my hearing. EDWARD BYFIELD . I lodged in the back parlour of the prisoner's house. On the Saturday night, about eight o'clock, as I was going out, Lees came to me, and taking my hand, put it to her eye. She came to my room about a quarter past twelve o'clock; she was dressed - she was very much bruised about the eye; she staid with me about ten minutes, and asked for some porter; she was perfectly sober; I was in bed - I had none. After going to sleep, I was disturbed again by a noise from Abbott's room, like somebody falling down - I heard a man's voice say""Bill, do'nt beat her so, for you will kill her;"" I thought it was Morris's voice; this was succeeded by a noise and scuffling again. I did not hear the woman's voice at all. When I got up in the morning, about eight o'clock, I went into Abbott's room, and saw Nicholls at the bed side, the prisoner had the deceased up in his arms; he said""I am d - d if she is not dead, I am glad of it."" I found she was dead, and fetched the constable - Abbott was between drunk and sober, he hardly knew what he was about; Bartlett fetched the doctor, and he came directly.COURT. Q. When Lees shewed you her eyes, did she appear in liquor - A. No. JOHN BARTLETT . I am beadle of St. Giles's. I was fetched to George-street, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and took the prisoner in custody; he appeared to have been in liquor overnight, and to have been asleep, he seemed quite stupified, he talked quite rational; he went quietly with me; and walked quite straight to the watch-house, which is about three hundred yards from the house. CLARA JAMES . I was servant to the prisoner - he lived in the front parlour with Mary Lees . Nicholls lived in the house - she came home as near as I can guess, about eight o'clock on Saturday night, she brought no man home with her - I sleep in the one pair; I heard very little of the quarrel, for I was up stairs cleaning the house all day; between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I came down to my dinner, and in the evening, I saw the prisoner and deceased together; several people was in the room - somebody were always coming in and out; I saw him follow her into the passage, and strike her three times with his fist, she did not strike him again. I went to bed between four and five o'clock in the morning, that was the time I undressed her; Morris lifted her into bed, for the other could not, he had no strength.Q. What had you been doing from eight o'clock till the time you went to bed - A. Standing at the street door to let the beds, because he would not let me come into the parlour - after putting her to bed, I asked him if I might go and lay down myself, and told him Mary would not be able to get up in the morning, nor him either; he said he would make her get up, for he would drag her out of bed, she should not play her larks with him - I went to bed, and saw no more of him till to-day. I think he had been drinking, he knew what he was about, and spoke very correct. I do not know that the deceased had been drinking.Prisoner. Q. Do you remember our going to the public-house together - A. No. They were in good humour at breakfast time.MR. JOHN DAVIS . I am assistant surgeon to the infirmary, for the parish of St. Giles, and St. George. On Sunday morning the 10th of February, between eight and nine o'clock, I went to examine the body of the deceased; I found her laying strait in bed, undressed - she had her shift on, it appeared very wet; I examined the body, and found no external marks of violence, except a contusion extending over the upper and lower eye lid. I examined every part of her person - I saw her again on Tuesday, about one or two o'clock in the afternoon, and attended the opening of her body; the head was first examined, there was a large coagulation of blood, of three or four ounces; It had been formed in consequence of a rupture, of a blood vessel, in the base of the brain - the coagulation was between the dina mater, and the brain - this was sufficient to cause her death, and I believe it to be the immediate cause of her death, I have no doubt of it - the extravasation would arise from being kicked or beat about the body; the treatment described, would be sufficient to cause the rupture. Apoplexy would be produced by such causes - I should think the rupture happened within four or five hours of her death; she did not appear to be at all a person likely to have apoplexy, from natural causes. External appearances of bruises are occasioned by the extravasation of blood, which settles under the skin; it is visible earlier when they are made near the bone, than on any fleshy part - it sometimes appears much earlier, and sometimes much later, but after death, it never appears unless it is produced before.MR. OGLE. I am surgeon to the Infirmary, and was present at the opening of the deceased's body. I have heard Mr. Davis's account, it is very correct, full, and satisfactory - I agree with his statement in every particular. If discoloration does not appear before death, it does not after.Q. You have heard acts of violence described, can you account for the absence of all symptoms of external violence - A. Yes; there might be the termination of bloodfrom the head, as to be the existing cause, without any marks.Prisoner's Defence. We went out, came home, and sat by the fire; I got smoking, and having three or four glasses, which got into my head; I found she was getting on too, and told her not to drink too much - I went out, returned, and said something to her; there was nobody in the room - she called me names, and hit me twice on the shoulder with something; I turned round, and hit her right in the eye with my flat hand, she said you have given me a nice eye, I said it serves you right, for you always begin with me first; she went out three times, and kept on having gin and rum, and was never further gone in liquor.

WILLIAM HARLAND . I am gardener to Mrs. Sarah Lewis , of Palmer's-green, near Southgate. I sleep in a room over the seed-room - there is a drying-ground between it and the dwelling-house. On Sunday, the 10th of February, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I left every thing safe, and returned to the room about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, and found a pane of glass, broken, the sash screws undone, and the sash was not shut close down; there was a ladder placed so that a man could get up to the window; it was brought from the barn. I found my chest broken open, a great coat, two coates, a nankeen coat, and a pocket-book taken, and a pearl eye-glass. I am sure they were all there at half-past eight o'clock; the window was then shut down and screwed. THOMAS BEST . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On Monday morning, about two o'clock, I was in East Barnet-lane, about two miles and a half from Mrs. Lewis's. The prisoners came up towards me, with another man; I was standing at the top of the lane. I took one of them, and my partner the other. I said,""What have you got here?"" they both said,""Working clothes."" They threw their bundles down, and a pump, and ran away on my saying I must see what they had got - the third man got away. I took Day - he said,""You had better let me go."" He kept learing over his shoulder; - I said, if he moved an inch, I would run my cutlass through his body. I handcuffed him, I never lost sight of him - I produce the bundles. I think the man who got away had the property. We found a large crow-bar at Andrews's house. RICHARD CLARKSON . I was with Best on the Monday morning after the robbery; his account is correct; I believe the man who escaped had the bundle - they were all in company - I afterwards went to Andrews's house, to make a search, and found him there. I saw the crow-bar - it might be used in digging gravel; I dug up part of a pump in the garden, which corresponded with what they left behind; the metal of it corresponds in colour. Day had it on his back. I am sure Andrews was one of them; he was two or three minutes in my view. When we took him at his house, he said he had nothing to do with it, and was only walking up the lane behind them. I am sure they were all three together, and two women were with them. They all tried to escape.DAY'S Defence. The man with the clothes was a good deal before me.ANDREWS'S Defence. I was walking to Southgate, arm in arm with my wife, and heard a cry of Stop thief! they ran towards town.

On the 21st of January, I was walking home to dinner, about half-past one o'clock. I am lame. I was in Gower's-walk, Whitechapel, and was accosted by a youth, not the prisoner, he looked at me indifferently, as he passed me; my face was towards Rosemary-lane, and his towards Church-lane; when he came abreast of me he rushed upon me with great violence, and snatched my watch from my pocket, with such violence that the outside case came off, and fell on the ground - he got the watch and appendages, and ran off as fast as he could; I cried Stop thief! pretty loud, and at that moment my attention was drawn to the prisoner, who was fifteen or sixteen yards from me; I had seen him before the other man came up, loitering about, and looking towards me. I do not think he was walking when I first saw him; I did not suspect him, and thought he might stop the other, but he did not; but when the man that robbed me came up to the prisoner, there were three of them, and all ran off together. I rather trembled, and was almost overcome; I sat down in a house for a few minutes - he was apprehended the same evening. JAMES THOMPSON . On the 21st of January, I saw the prisoner standing by our door, in Gower's-walk; I noticed him, and saw another lad come up to him, he was about fourteen years old: he said to the prisoner as he turned the corner""Now."" I looked the other way, and saw another lad, of the same size, standing by the corner, and immediately, as Mr. Bond turned the corner, I saw the lad snatch the watch out of his pocket, and run off by our door. Mr. Bond cried Stop thief! I could not get out of the house to pursue him as the table stood by the door, but directly the lad ran off the prisoner ran to him and hit him on the head. I saw the watch in his hand, with the chain hanging out; the lad directly gathered the chain up in his hand, and all three ran off together. A dog ran out of a cooperage and ran after them - the prisoner beat the dog back twice. SAMUEL MILLER . I am an officer. On the 21st of January, I met Bond in Lambeth-street, about three minutes walk from Thompson's; he said he had been robbed of his watch - Thompson was with him, also a cooper, who described the persons.

I am an appraiser, and live in Maiden-lane, Covent-Garden. On Sunday evening, the 6th of January, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was in Fleet-street, just at the end of Bridge-street, on the market side, I observed the prisoner and two others coming towards me - I am sure of his person - they made a pause within two or three yards of me; I passed on one side to give them room, they let me pass; I went on five or six steps, turned my head, and saw the same men standing still talking together, and looking towards me - my seals were visible. I quickened my pace, and after going ten or twelve steps; they turned and passed me; I then lost sight of them until I got to Wine Office-court, when I again saw them; they were returning to meet me, and before I could recover from my surprise, one of them (not the prisoner) made a snatch at my watch, my fob was twisted inside, and the chain broke, through the violence of the pull. I attempted to seize the man, when the prisoner and the other got round me; the prisoner put his hands against me, and prevented my following the man with my seals; he ran up Hind-court, and the prisoners followed him; I pursued, and on going up the court I received a kick from one of them, near my groin, which prevented my following for a few seconds; I then followed, but lost sight of them in Gough-square. I ran down a court, leading to Shoe-lane, and rose an alarm; I turned back, came into Fleet-street, went into the court, and saw two men looking for something on the ground; one of them, who was very intent on looking, did not see me, but the others did, and gave a signal; he ran towards Fleet-street, the light reflected on his features, and I identified him; it was the prisoner. I had seen him three times by a good light, and am certain of him; he had prevented my pursuing the thief. I then attempted to seize him, and said,""Now I have one of you at any rate;"" he replied,""Have you, ***** you, then take that,"" and gave me a tremendous blow on my back. I had a stick in my hand - I cannot say whether the blow did not come from my stick, by his knocking against me. He ran back up the court. I followed, and from an alarm I gave, a gentleman stopped him; when I came up, he was just rising from the ground, trying to get away. I rose my stick to strike him, and the gentleman; thinking me one of the party, let him go; he was finally secured. I am sure of his being the man. It was a moon-light night, and there was a strong light from the fish shop. THOMAS MARSH . I am an engraver, and live in Gough-square. About a quarter before ten o'clock at night, I was sitting in my parlour, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went out, and seized a person at my door, who said,""There he goes!"" In consequence of which, I let him go. I saw a great many people coming and heard somebody had been robbed - I went in again - I have no recollection of his person. Five minutes after I heard the alarm again, I went out, and heard footsteps coming from Hind-court, and made to the corner leading to King's Head-court, and seized a person about the size of the prisoner, who was running up; we wrestled, and were both on the ground, when the prosecutor came up, and said,""I have got you now,"" and lifted up his stick.

Mr. William Duncan lives in the house; they are wholesale hosiers. On Saturday, the 22d of December, I left the warehouse, and was sent for about half-past eight o'clock, on Sunday evening, and found the premises had been entered, the drawers in the warehouse emptied, and the property mentioned in the indictment, amounting in value to between 500 l. and 600 l. stolen; it consisted of silk gloves and stockings; a black bag laid on the counter, with a parcel of men's knotted silk hose, of about 100 l. value.

I double-locked the street door, and left all safe; the clerk had the keys of the warehouse; he took them away on Saturday night. I returned at six o'clock, and found the street door locked; but cannot say, whether it was double-locked as I had left it. On going into the passage, I found a black bag containing silk stockings, which was not there when I left the house. The patrol was coming by, and I told him; I stood at the door, and did not leave it. The warehouse door I found wide open, which was shut when I left, and a dark lantern in the warehouse.

JOHN BRADFIELD . I live in Benjamin-street, Clerkenwell. I have known Grout eight years. I met him in Bishopsgate-street; he offered me a pair of gloves for me to sell to Mrs. Stevens or to her girl; he knew that I knew Stevens; I am always about Bishopsgate; I sold them to Mrs. Stevens for 1 s. worth of liquor; she keeps a liquor-shop. Grout took 6 d. and we had 6 d. worth of liquor between us; this was two days before he was taken up; they were unfinished silk gloves. DANIEL BENJAMIN LEADBETTER , I am a marshalman. In consequence of information, Bradfield and Mr. Duncan, went to Grout's lodging. I remained in Bishopsgate church-yard; they returned to me there; Bradfield and I then went to Grout's lodging, and on returning found him with Mr. Duncan. I took him; we went into a public-house in Wormwood-street. I asked him if he had given Bradfield two pair of gloves to sell to Stevens; he said he had, and that he found them in a bit of paper in Bishopsgate-street, by the London Tavern. I asked him if he ever had any more, or had seen any more, he said No; there was only one pair. The question was repeated more than once or twice; he gave the same answer. I took him and Bradfield to the justice-room; this was on Wednesday the 2nd of January - I felt his right hand coat pocket and found nothing; as I was going to the left hand coat pocket, he put his hand in it, and said,""Don't take my money."" I watched him draw his hand out, and saw a piece of paper in it. I opened his hand, and took it out; it contained four pair of silk gloves. I believe there was a penny, a halfpenny and a farthing in his pocket. I said,""How is this! you told me you had only the one pair, that you sold to Stevens."" He said,""The four pair were with the one pair; I found them altogether."" I went several times, and to a great many places, to find Solomon, but could not. I went to his neighbourhood, to Grout's, and several public-houses. The paper was not muddy - it was a loose bit of paper - I cannot say what weather it was on the 23d of December. WILLIAM STEVENS . I keep a wine vault in Bishopsgate-street. I do not know of Bradfield's coming to my house. I saw the gloves in possession of one of our young women. My wife is not here. WILLIAM BRAND . I am a marshalman. I accompanied Mr. Duncan and Harrison to search Grout's lodgings, in Still-alley, Houndsditch. I searched two rooms on the second floor - the house had no number. Grout's wife came in at the time. In one of the rooms I found a black bag; there was a bed in each room. In the large room backward in which his wife was, I found a black bag containing a quantity of mitts and gloves, all silk. I found the bag in an old broken press-bedstead; and in a box, containing women's clothes, I found a paper, containing more silk gloves, I think about four dozen. In the next room, which is a small front room, communicating by a door from one to the other, and fastened on the large room side (both rooms had doors communicating with the staircase.) I found two black bags, empty; and a pair of half silk stockings, which had been worn. I compared the three bags with the other found in the prisoner's house, they tallied exactly in size, colour, quality, shape, and tape. Grout's wife was taken, I saw her in Grout's company - he acknowledged her as his wife - she was afterwards discharged.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How did he acknowledge her as his wife - A. He said,""It is true what I told you to-day, that my wife brought them, and here she is, ask her."" The door opening from the small room to the staircase was unfastened; I could go from the large room to the small one. ROBERT HARRISON . I assisted in the search. I produce the four pair of gloves, also the gloves and mitts found in the large room, and the gloves found in the box, also the bags. I searched for Barnett, without success, at several places. I went with two or three more officers who knew him.Cross-examined. Q. Do not hatters use those bags - A. I do not know; they are made of black linen. CATHARINE GROUT . I am the daughter of Grout. I know Solomon; he was my father's lodger, he lodged inthe little front room, for three or four weeks before my father was taken, and then he went away.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where did you live at the time of this transaction - A. I was servant to Mr. Lazarus, of Cutler-street; I went home three or four times a week for clean things; my father's is the large room, a door leads into the other room, which is fastened on my father's side, with a piece of leather and a nail. Only Solomon lived in the other room - my mother cleaned it, and made his bed. I never saw the bags before.Q. Where have you come from - A. Brand's house - he told me that he could see my father was innocent, because he was lame; and said it was my duty to come and get my father off.Q. You do not mind so as you get your father off - A. No; I have no reason to care for Solomon; I am angry with him for getting my father into trouble.MR. BOLLAND. Q. How does Solomon get to his room - A. There is a door to the staircase.Q. Did you state what you have to-day, before you went to Brand's - A. Yes, at Guildhall. I have been kept at Brand's for fear I should run away. I was sent to sleep at a person's the night before I was examined. I am near sixteen years old. THOMAS EVANS . I superintend the prosecutor's manufactory at Nottingham - I have examined the property produced, and have no doubt that it is their manufacture.Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Are they in a large way - A. Yes; but they sell nothing in this country; every thing is cased and sent abroad; we pack them ourselves before they are sent out.J. H. PEARSON re-examined. I have examined this property; here are a pair of half-hose, partly worn; I had seen them on the Friday or Saturday before the robbery - the mitts and gloves are all their's; I had seen them in the course of two months previous; they had been many years in the house; we sell for exportation only, and pack and ship all goods ourselves; there is a private mark on them.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you mean to to say you saw that identical pair the day before - A. I saw the dozen of which they formed a part, and opened the paper - we have a mark on them.Q. Would not that mark be on every pair you have - A. No, only on that dozen, as it was all we had of that quality.COURT, Q. Must all these goods be taken at one or at different times - A. I should think it would take two hours to remove them; they might take them away at once in three or four bags, each bag would weigh fifty or sixty pounds. They opened six drawers to get them. ROBERT HESKETH . I am an officer. I searched after Barnett in the neighbourhood of Petticoat-lane, I knew him before; I found him on the 21st of January; I had been looking for him for a fortnight or three weeks. I took him into the George, public-house. Worster was with me, and sat in a box opposite to him - he opened the door, shut me in the box, ran off, and made his escape down Still-alley. I followed him, and was then stopped by his brothers - as he went out at the door, he said,""Joe,"" his brother Joe stopped me. I saw him again on the 2d of February, when I was in the Lee Hoy, Mile-end, and took him.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. He was smoking his pipe very quiet, on the 21st of January - A. Yes; he was at the corner of Still-alley, which is a place much frequented by officers. I told him to come into the George, public-house and stop till Worster returned. I said,""I suppose it is all right, or you would not be standing here,"" he smiled, and said""Yes, or I should not be here."" This was on the day Grout's wife was discharged.GROUT'S Defence. I am perfectly innocent of the robbery. My wife brought the things up into our room - I asked what she had there, she said it was a few things belonging to Mrs. Barnard, where she was lodging.SOLOMON'S Defence. I know nothing whatever of the transaction.MR. PEARSON, re-examined. The goods were worth 500 l. or 600 l., without those found in the passage - Those found in Still-alley, are not worth above 15 l. or 16 l. PHILIP SHANNON . I am a baker, and live in Union-place, Tabernacle-row, I have two rooms there. On the 23d of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Solomon knocked at my door, and asked me to go to his father, who lives about one hundred yards off, to ask him for a shirt and handkerchief, as he was not on good terms with him. I asked him in and went, and his father gave them to me - he went into my kitchen and washed himself, then went into my bed-room and dressed himself. I asked him to dine with me, which he did; we dined between twelve and one o'clock, and after dinner, had two or three pots of beer - he staid with me till ten o'clock.

Yes, this morning she was, I left at nine o'clock, and have not been home since - she is her own doctor, she knows her complaint, and has medicine in the house. I suppose it is nine months since a doctor attended her; she had a very violent pain in her bowels this morning, and said she was very poorly, and had rather not come here - I am sure she is too ill to come; she said,""A'y'nt you going to the Old Bailey to night?"" I said,""Yes, will you go,"" she said,""No, I don't find myself very well; I am very ill still.""Q. You only asked if she should like to come - A. She not being a married woman, did not like the disgrace. Ileft her ill this morning - I understand the prisoner lived in Still-alley, I was never there.

The prisoner was our shop-man, at a yearly salary; he did not live in the house. On the 31st of January, between eight and nine o'clock, in consequence of suspicions, which we had, while he was gone to breakfast, we weighed a parcel, which I had seen him do up for a friend of his, from whom we had several orders before, and he always took the opportunity of doing them up during the absence of every body. I found the order entered in the order book as 24 lbs. of coffee at one price, and 12 lbs. of another kind, and a loaf of lump sugar; he had called me to see the sugars weighed, which was right; on weighing the coffee there was an excess of 7 lbs - there was 43 lbs. instead of 36 lbs. The invoice was written inconsequence of the order entered by the prisoner, for 36 lbs. The parcel was put into the bag as before, and I went to the Mansion-house and got some officers, and on returning found the order was not to go till one o'clock, as he said his friend, Mr. Charles Tousley, (who he said the order was for,) was after a house in Piccadilly, and he, the prisoner would no longer be responsible for him, but if we went at one o'clock, Tousley would be at home, to pay himself.

(by that I understood that he was confused.) He said,""You may search my premises, and see my books."" I said""Your wife says you have no books"" - he said he had a day book and bills; he was taken away; Marchmont and I then went to the house, and found his wife sorting bills, and in a small place, parted from the shop, we found five or six small parcels of sugar, and things.Cross-examined by MR.

I went to the Magistrate, who asked the man's name; I said I did not know it; and he said it was no use to come without it.

I went up to Merry, and asked him if he had not some sacks concealed about him. He said,""I have a sack."" I put my hand round him, and felt one under his clothes, marked J.

They looked round the corners, and kept asking,""Where is he?"" I still said,""This is him,"" but they took no notice of me - I thought I had stopped the wrong person, and let him go.

I am clerk to James and Edward Turner , flannel and baise manufacturers, of Lancashire. They have a warehouse in Love-lane, Aldermanbury; the prisoner called in the early part of July - I had never seen him before. He said, he understood we were manufacturers of flannels, blankets, and woollen goods, and if we could do those articles well for him, he should become a very good customer; he gave me his card, and said he was Colonial purveyor - this card is like the one he gave. (reads)""J. White, Colonial purveyor, 28, Bow-lane, Cheapside."" He said he had obtained the appointment through the interest of the Duke of York, the person who last held the appointment having died, and saved something considerable - he then took from his pocket some papers, among which was a printed letter folded up; he opened it to show me the manner in which his orders came; it was dated Chatham, and signed""Harris,"" and addressed to J. White; it was similar to this.(looking at one.)This letter was here read, and purported to be a circular, dated from the King's yard, Chatham, and ordering a quantity of articles to be delivered at His Majestys Stores, Chatham, marked Colonial Service. JOSHUA ALDRON . This was filled up with the quantity of things wanted, it appeared to be an authentic Government order. I observed to him that goods for government orders were generally contracted for - he said this was quite a different thing altogether; that these orders came from the Colonies to his Majesty's depot, Chatham, in too small quantities of each article, to make it worth while for government to contract for them - that they were put together, and sent up to London for him to furnish. He then shewed me an invoice of linen goods, bought of Townsend and Brown, Cheapside; I do not exactly recollect the amount; he said, if he bought any of our goods, he should refer us to them. He then said he had retired from business some years, was unacquainted with woollen goods, and would send a person to look at them; that he had taken the warehouse in Bow-lane, for the purpose of receiving and packing the goods for Chatham - he left, and in a day or two, a person called and looked at the goods, on account of White - he did not select any, but a written order came afterward, signed John White ; in consequence of which, I went to Messrs. Townsend's, and afterwards saw White. I told him of the person who had called, and that I had been to Townsend's, and told them I was referred to them by White, who had ordered goods to the amount of 150 l. or 160 l., and that Mr. Brown said White had been introduced to them by a person, who had before furnished them with a valuable customer, who had told them of his appointment, and they had sent him 300 l. or 400 l. worth of goods, supposing all was right, but that they knew nothing about his property, but relied on the representation they had.Q. When you saw White, what passed - A. He came to see if I was satisfied with his reference. I said I had been to Townsend's, and told him what passed, but that they could give me no information of his property; he said,""As to property, it is of no kind of consequence; these goods are sent down to his Majesty's depot, at Chatham. I send my accounts down to Chatham every quarter, they are there examined, and passed in two or three days, and then I receive a bill on Government, which will enable me to pay you, and all my engagements."" I considered this a very safe account - I sent him in goods to the amount of 151 l., to Bow-lane, entirely on the representation he made, I sent twenty-two pieces of flannel, eighty pair of blankets, and eighty rugs; they were all the property of Messrs. Turners.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you seen Birch, who looked at the goods before you saw White. - A. No. Townsend and Co. are persons of great respectability; their recommendation had weight certainly.Q. Did it not have such weight as to induce you to trust him. - A. That depends on circumstances. I do not say it would, as they stated he was not a man of property. I should not think him worth credit unless he held the appointment under government. I would not have let him have them, unless I understood from him that he held the appointment - it might have influence, added to his representation - his producing the circular had weight I recommended him to another house for hosiery goods.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you believe he held the appointment in consequence of what they said. - A. Of course. I suppose they believed he held the appointment. I would not have trusted him from what they said, if it was not in consequence of his having the appointment.Prisoner. Q. Did you not say it was a maxim with you to trust no person, unless you know where they dealt - A. I do not recollect - it might pass.MR. ALLEY. Q. After the prisoner had the goods, did you see him. - A. Yes; he acknowledged receiving them, and said the inspectors had found fault with the blankets, and he had been obliged to make some little allowance on them, but in future it would not take place; for he had been to Chatham, and given them a dinner, which cost him 10 l., and they were good friends.MR. JAMES CHAPMAN . I am chief clerk in the Colonial department, secretary of state's office. The prisoner had no appointment in the Colonial department. If he had an appointment as Colonial-purveyor by the secretary of state, I must have known it. Goods sent to the Colonies are supplied by the Commissariat department. Government appoint no Colonial purveyor.Cross-examined. Q. Purveyor is merely a dealer. - A. Precisely so. I know no Harris at Chatham. There are no such persons as Colonial purveyors; there are Colonial agents. I know nothing of Government giving bills to Colonial purveyors.MR. WILLIAM HILL . I am a clerk in the treasury, and agent for Commissariat supplies. I provide great quantities of these sort of articles. I do not furnish them as a tradesman. I have a salary for my services. Every article relating to the Commissariat department are furnished by me. I never heard of a Colonial purveyor.

There are persons who supply other articles to the navy and ordnance.CAPTAIN CHARLES BENTLEY . I have come from the depot of Chatham. I am staff captain. I never saw the prisoner before this evening. He never supplied goods there. There is no such station, nor such things furnished there, except through the Commissariat department.Prisoner's Defence.

I have a great deal of business at the Horse Guards, and can at all times have a recommendation from his Royal Highness. I am hardly, injuriously, and wickedly dealt by.

The prisoner drove it, and put my trunk and two boxes in with a bundle, which contained the articles stated in the indictment, and other things. On arriving at Berner's-street, the footman handed my things out, and I myself went in; and in about half an hour, missed my bundle. I immediately went to the stand I took the coach from, and made enquiry, and next morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, I found the prisoner at his master's in Bulstrode-mews, and asked if he had seen any thing of the bundle I had left in the coach? he said he had not put up the steps of his coach, before a woman and a man accosted him at our door in Berner's-street, with a large box and bundle, and asked him to take them to the Ship, public-house, Charing-cross, and to drive as fast as he could; that the man wanted to ride on the box, but he said he never suffered that, and he must ride with the woman inside - that the man got in the coach, and he drove them to the Ship, and had something to drink with them there, and they went off by the Dulwich, Greenwich, or Woolwich stage. I said I was quite sure he had taken up no fare at our door; he said he did. I said I should certainly take steps to obtain my clothes. When he took me up, I told him I was going to my place - I went to Marlborough-street, they said he ought to leave it in Essex-street, at the expiration of four days.

I know the stockings are mine, for I cut them down a little, and footed them; one with a pair of cotton stockings, and the other with silk, and one has a piece grafted in the toe. I described this before I opened it. I can swear positively to having put them in the bundle myself. The cap I know is mine, I saw my mother make it.Cross-examined. Q. You would not speak to it when you found it. - A. I said the same as I do now, that I did not make it.Prisoner's Defence.

I went down and missed two pair more - he was then gone to tea. Russell marked the remaining pair, and at eight I left him in the cellar for a few minutes. I then went down, sent him up, and saw the other pair was gone. He was stopped, and the leather found on him in the counting-house, in his bosom; he denied having it, but when it was found, he said it was the first time. Mr. Jackson said it was not, and he then said he had sold a good many pieces to a man named Wright. JOHN RUSSELL . Gibson's account is correct. I marked the leather.(Property produced and sworn to.)

JOHN ATWOOD . I am a Custom-house officer, and live in North-street, City Road. On the 1st of February, at half-pasttwelve o'clock at noon, I was passing through Rose-lane, Spitalfields, the prisoner stood with his back against a wall opposite Flower and Dean-street, and two others, a few yards from him. I noticed him particularly before I came up to him, and the moment I got up, he advanced to the end of the curb, and made a snatch at my watch, the ribbon broke, he got the seal and key, and ran up the opposite street - I ran after him, calling. Stop thief! and his companions followed close behind; he turned to the right, and I gave up the pursuit, and went to Worship-street office, described his dress and appearance, and in half an hour I went with the officer to the George, public-house, in George-yard, Whitechapel; two went in the back way, and I and the other at the front; and as I entered, three persons were coming out; neither of them was him; and as I looked round the tap-room, the prisoner was brought in from the back premises, I immediately said,""That is the man."" I could pick him out from 5000, and I think I saw one of the others there.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long did the transaction last - A. Not a minute. I saw his face before I got up to him; nobody but him ran before me - he took the first turning to the right.Q. Have you not said that you have seen a man since so much like him that you could not tell one from the other - A. It is as false as God is true - it is impossible I can be mistaken, I am positive of him. BARNARD GLEED . Atwood came to Worship-street. Atfield, Garton, and I accompanied him. Garton and he went in at the front, and I and Atfield at the back door. The prosecutors said the man had a brown coat on, and he believed he was a Jew. I went in first - the door is very low - I was obliged to stoop to get in, and nearly passed the prisoner as I was stooping, the place being dark. I have known him many years. I think he said, How do you do, I said.""How do you do."" Atfield caught hold of him, and brought him into the tap-room. He was dressed in a brown coat. We found Garton and the prosecutor in the tap-room, and he said he was the man who robbed him - his description answered to the prisoner.Cross-examined. He only said he had a brown coat, and was a Jew - A. Yes, that he was shabbily dressed. There is a man about the neighbourhood like the prisoner. I heard no voice outside say, That is the man. THOMAS GARTON . I was with Gleed. His statement is correct. The prosecutor swore positively to him immediately. WILLIAM ATFIELD . I was with them, and took him from the description given. If any one outside had said,""that is the man,"" I must have heard it.Prisoner's Defence. When I was coming in, Atfield said I want you, he came in and said,""Here, I have got him, this is he."" WILLIAM ATFIELD . I said no such thing. MARGARET PRIOR . I take in needle-work and washing. I was at my door in Flower and Dean-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw a young lad of short stature, run by my door - he had a light-coloured pepper and salt coat on, and was very much pock-marked. He ran towards the end of Flower and Dean-street - nobody was running before him - the prosecutor was following him about six yards behind, calling Stop thief!Q. Did you see enough of the lad to say whether it was the prisoner or not - A. It was not I am positive. I saw no more of what passed till half-past one o'clock, when the prosecutor came back with two officers, and I, as well as many more neighbours, hallowed out,""For God's sake you have got the wrong man;"" it was the general cry. I went to Worship-street to tell what I knew about it, but some man said I must not go in.Q. You took the man who was running before Atwood to be the thief - A. Yes; no other could be.COURT. Q. He was a young lad - A. Yes; he was not fair nor dark, nor so tall as the prisoner. It is impossible for any one to take the one for the other; he does not resemble him in the slightest degree. The prosecutor came down my street last Sunday afternoon - I was at the door - he asked me to tell him the name of the street; he said then that he had made a grand mistake, as he thought it was Thrall-street, and asked if I recollected his being robbed. I said, very well; but he had got the wrong person. He said he had not; and if he had, he had sworn to him, and must swear to him again.Q. Perhaps you knew the prisoner - Yes, I have known him as a neighbour for twelve years; he lived in Winfield-street, with his mother and father.Q. Then he was not near the place at all - A. No one was near except the prosecutor and thief, neither behind or before - Mrs. Myers was also at her door. The lad was a stranger; he was crying out,""For God's sake don't stop me, I have only broken a window."" He ran about a hundred yard up our street, and turned down Cale-street, which is the first turning. I have not seen him since. Mrs. Myers did not go to the office.JUDA MYERS. I live in Flower and Dean-street, at the the corner of Cale-street, three doors from Prior. I was cleaning my door, and all at once heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the thief running, and as he passed me he said,""For God's sake don't stop me, I have only broken a window."" He was a shortish chap, high-shouldered, and had a pepper-and-salt coat on. I think it was a dark one. I saw Atwood running after him; nobody else was running either before or behind; the chap turned down Cale-street, went up Thrall-street, and I went in doors. They passed me at half-past twelve o'clock, as near as I can tell; and in about three quarters of an hour I saw the prosecutor pass our street again with two officers; all the neighbours cried out.""You have got the wrong man."" They had the prisoner in charge. I said,""For God's sake you have got the wrong man, that is not the man you cried Stop thief! after."" I did not go to Worship-street.COURT. Q. Did you know the officers - A. Atfield was one.Q. Was the man's coat so dark that it might be mistaken for brown - A. I think so; it was a dark pepper-and-salt colour. I should think the man would not come up to the prisoner's ear in height. The prisoner is a much darker man than him, and he was very much pock-marked - the prisoner is a little so; he is quite a different man.Q. Is it possible for one to be taken for the other - A. It would be a great mistake, for he was quite a different man, he was stout and the prisoner is slim, and he was high-shouldered. I only know the prisoner by seeing him pass our street with his bag of clothes.SOLOMON JOSEPH. I am a clothes-man, and live in Winfield-street. I know the prisoner very well. I met him in Holborn this day four weeks, by Middle-row. It was on Friday the 1st of February I walked with him from there into Bishopsgate church-yard, talking about business, and when our sabbath came on. We got to the church at one o'clock, and I left him. I looked at Bishopsgate church clock, it was not five minutes under or over one. Flower and Dean-street is half a mile from the church.COURT. Q. How does he get his living - A. He carries clothes about, and had his bag at this time. He lives with his father in Wentworth-street. I left him at the church.Q. When were you applied to to give evidence - A. My lodger came home about three or four o'clock, and said this man was fully committed for trial - I was surprised.Q. Did you want to be home by any particular time - A. No; I always come home between one and two o'clock - our sabbath begins at half-past three in winter, and then it moves to four, and that day it moved to half-past four. I always look at the clock to see how long I am out.MR. ANDREWS. Q. What was your reason for looking at the clock - A. I always want to know how long I am out. I had something to do in our church that day - he said sabbath began at four o'clock, and I said it was half-past. I do not know yet what he was taken up for. I would not believe my lodger, and so I asked his father what it was for; he said he did not know; and I said he walked with me from Holborn, and left me at one o'clock.COURT. Q. Did your lodger tell you what time the offence was committed, or what it was for - A. No.Q. Then how came you to say he was with you at one o'clock - A. That was the time I left him. THOMAS GARTON . When the prisoner was apprehended Atfield told him he was charged with picking a pocket, at half-past twelve o'clock that day - he said nothing about being with another person at the time. WILLIAM ATFIELD . I and the prosecutor told him the time in the tap-room - he said nothing about having been with another one. BARNARD GLEED . He said nothing of having been with Joseph, or any one. JOHN ATWOOD . I believe I told him it was half-past twelve o'clock. He said not a word of having been in Joseph's company, or with any one else. GUILTY . Aged 40.

On the 10th of January, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in London-fields, Hackney, and had a ridicule in my hand, containing this property, I was coming towards town, and near Exmouth-place, some person came behind, and snatched it out of my hand. I had an opportunity of seeing his face - I turned round, and saw him running down Exmouth-place. I called,""Stop thief! and was a good deal frightened. I did not see him laid hold of; but a young man who was before me, ran after him. I did not see whether he laid hold him - the prisoner was brought back in a quarter of an hour - my ridicule was produced.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. It was done so quick, you had no opportunity of seeing the person. - A. No; there were four or five examinations, I believe, before the magistrate. I did not understand that it was on account of insufficient evidence. ROBERT HAYWARD . I am assistant at Mr. Ayres' school, at Hackney. I was in the London-fields, and passed the prosecutrix, about fifty yards towards town; she had a ridicule in her hand, and was going towards town. I heard her call out, Stop thief! and saw a person run from her towards Exmouth-place; he was alone. I pursued and lost sight of him for about two minutes. I saw him come out of a private house, but had not seen him go in. I am sure the person who came out of the house was the same who I had seen running away. I went up and said,""This is the man."" Another person laid hold of him. I picked the ridicule up at his feet, and delivered it to Miss Gozard, who claimed it.Cross-examined. Q. What distance was he when you first saw him running. - A. About fifty or sixty yards. I had passed both the prisoner and prosecutrix before I particularly remarked him as I passed, and have not a doubt about him. I am sure he is the person who ran from the lady. RICHARD PERRY . I am a carpenter, and live on CambridgeHeath. I was at work in Exmouth-place, at an unfinished house, about one hundred yards from the footpath, and heard the cry of Stop thief! The prisoner had got by the house - he was running alone, and the only person I could see. I pursued him, and at the bottom of Exmouth-place, I lost sight of him for a minute or two. Mr. Hayward pointed him out to me, and said,""This is the man."" I found him within twenty or thirty yards of where I lost sight of him. I believe nobody was in sight but the prisoner and Hayward. I saw the ridicule on the step where he stood - Hayward picked it up. I think it impossible for any body to drop it but the prisoner.Cross-examined. Q. How near was he to it. - A. On the same step, about eighteen inches - it was on the step of a house enclosed with iron rails, and a fore court. I think no one could throw it there but him.COURT. Q. Did he claim any acquaintance at that house. - No; it was Mr. Grout's house. - The door was shut. FRANCES SUTTLING . I was servant to Mr. Grout. I cannot speak to the prisoner.

I passed between the men and the women, and felt a finger at my waistcoat pocket. I immediately said,""I'll not be robbed, keep your hands off;"" a young man rushed before me, and said,""Do you say I robbed you?"" I said, I'll have nothing to say to you."" I was going on, and at the corner of Black Eagle-street, somebody behind pushed against me, and shoved me up the street, and one of them violently thrust his hands into my waistcoat pocket, and took out mywatch. I cried Stop thief! he was followed to the end of the street, and somebody said,""We have got your watch."" I found the prisoner in custody, and gave him in charge at the watch-house. I cannot say whether he was one of the men, my sight is very bad. THOMAS HART . The prisoner was given in my charge with the watch. WILLIAM RUSHBROOK . I was coming along Brick-lane, between five and six o'clock, and opposite the end of Black Eagle-street, I saw the prosecutor surrounded by three fellows, and from the position they were in, I thought they were robbing him - I was running to the spot, and had got as far as the middle of the road, when all three ran off - the prisoner up the lane, another in the opposite direction, and the third down Black Eagle-street, where he fell down, and I overtook him. He got up and was running off again, I struck him on the head with my umbrella, he then turned from the middle of the street, towards the pavement, when several persons seized him. I saw his hand in a position, as if he had thrown something in the kennel, I picked the watch out, and with several others, took him to the watch-house - it was the prisoner.(Property produced and sworn to.)Prisoner's Defence. I heard the cry and joined in the pursuit for twenty yards, and saw a lad drop something - they collared me and said I was the person who dropped it. GUILTY . Aged 16.

PRENDERGAST. Q. When he was brought to the office, did Purton say, that was the man he originally applied for the warrant about - A. He said that was the man who sold him the pamphlet - it was left in my hands to justify the warrant being issued; it was left in my possession before the warrant was granted. JOHN PURTON . I am a constable, on the Bow-street establishment. On the 26th of December, I bought this pamphlet at Carlisle's shop, in Fleet-street, of the prisoner.Q. Did you attempt to learn his name - A. I tried to watch him from the shop; I went in and identified him when the warrant was issued - he is the person it was issued against. When I bought the pamphlet he was behind the counter, apparently serving, and behind the counter selling the same work when he was taken; there was a great many people about the shop then, and on the 27th, when I went with Harrison to take him, I did not learn his name till I got to the Justice-room. The book has my name on it, which I wrote on it a few minutes after.Cross-examined. Q. Are you messenger to the Constitutional Association. - A. I was employed by a gentleman named Sharp, who I have heard is connected with the association - I am not regularly employed by him; I have been employed to go no where but to Carlile's.Q. Have you been concerned on any other business for Sharp, besides at Carlisle's shop - I have employed persons myself, on account of their determination to sell those books, and myself being known.Q. Whose determination - A. Why the people of the shop. I have seen placards in the shop to that effectQ. What was the nature of the placard. - A. That the address to the Reformers of the 24th of June was still to be had.The libel was here read; it was the same as that produced on Vamplue's trial.

At the time you came into the shop with the officers to arrest this man, did you say to any person, that the defendant was not the man who sold you the pamphlet - A. I deny it.Defendant. Q. Did you not buy the pamphlet when you came with the warrant - A. I told the officer I would buy a pamphlet of the person I meant, but that was not the book produced.The Defendant called SUSAN WRIGHT . I was housekeeper at Mr. Carlile's. When this man was arrested, on the 27th of December, I lived there; I had just come down to prepare dinner for the two men.Q. What two men - A. The man unknown, and the prisoner - I saw some one open the counter, and assume an authority, which I thought he had no business to do. I opened the door directly, and asked what he wanted; it was near one o'clock - he looked very contemptuously and made no reply. I asked him again what he came for, and he was talking to Purton, the spy.Q. What do you mean by a spy - A. An informer; persons who go and buy these pamphlets to entrap them; they buy them and pretend that they understand them to be sedititious, and I heard Purton say to the officer,""That is not the man.""Q. Who did he speak of - A. I suspect by the conversation that passed between them, that the man they wanted was gone away, and that the prisoner was not the man.Q. Did you ask him whether he wanted that man or not - A. I did say something, but what it was, I cannot recollect.Q. Did you ever say to him,""This is not the man who you are going to take away"" - A. No.Q. How came you not to say so - A. I did afterwards.Q. Be cautious what you say, you did not say""Do you mean the prisoner is not the man"" - A. No, I did not. I heard the officer say to (Rhodes) the prisoner,""I have got a warrant for you."" Purton was in the shop, I directly said,""If there is a warrant against you, hear it read, and see that it is in your own name"" - his name is Joseph Rhodes .Q. That is the name he went by in your shop - A. I received him by that name when he came from the country - I turned into the little room, and did not see any thing more, but requested the officer to let him stay and dine, which he refused.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. That we may not differ about persons, is that the man, (pointing to him) who you call Purton the spy - A. Yes.Q. And is that man the officer with whom you had the conversation - A. I cannot say whether that is the person who arrested Rhodes, or the man unknown, he arrested one of them; there were two men arrested that day, within an hour, and I asked both officers to let them stay and dine.Q. Did you ask the men, or Purton only - A. Oh! of course, I should not ask Purton to dinner, I only asked the officer to let the prisoner dine, the man unknown was arrested afterwards by another officer. I am married, I have lived at Carlile's since Mary Ann Carlile went away, since November, till the shop was closed - I was housekeeper, I am not related to Carlile.Q. Have you the misfortune to be indicted for selling these pamphlets - A. If you call it a misfortune, Sir, I have, I would rather enjoy my own opinion, of course, and be indicted for it - there are two indictments against me.Q. Either of them for publishing Pain's works - No answer.Q. Is it for selling pamphlets, at Carlile's shop - A. Yes; I was shopwoman there for three months, that was in the spring - I left just before November. When the indictment was found against me, I was removed from the shop.Q. You went away, and returned as housekeeper - A. Yes.Q. You talk of enjoying your own opinion, have you any belief in the Holy Scriptures - A. I shall not answer that, I do not think it a question I have a right to answer.COURT. The question is whether you believe the Holy Gospels, on which you have been sworn - A. When I am brought to trial, perhaps I may give my opinion.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who hired the prisoner and other man to serve in the shop - A. I did not; the prisoner had served there a very few days, I think not a week; the other man had only been there during the time the prisoner went, and the officer came back.Q. Well but how many days had he been backward and forward - A. That I cannot tell; I have seen placards in the shop - when there is any thing to sell people generally put up placards. I never saw one saying""This is the mart for blasphemy and sedition;"" for I very rarely pressed myself in among the crowd, to see them - I swear I never saw it in the window.Q. Where did you see it then - A. I saw it in my own hands, though whoever copied that placard out of the window did not copy the inverted comma's.Q. Do you mean to say the words blasphemy and sedition were not there - A. I mean to say, I cannot say any thing about it; it was given me with many others that were given me for waste paper. The placard I speak of was copied in the newspapers, and I said""That placard had better be taken down.""Q. I wish you to state again, what took place at the time Purton and the officer came into the shop, telling you I mean to contradict you if you speak untrue, and that you will hear of it in a different shape - now I ask you again, were you in the shop when Purton came in - A.

I told you that when he came behind the counter, I opened the door of the little room, and asked what he wanted, he turned round and made no answer, but said something to Purton, and, by their motions, I thought that they had got the wrong man, and that they wanted another man, who was gone away; then I asked him a second time, and he said tothe man""I have got a warrant for you."" I told him to hear it read, and see that it was in his own name; then I asked him to let him stay and dine.Q. Did Purton say or do any thing all this time - A. Something passed which I did not understand, for I retired into the little room.Q. I think I heard you say, Purton said that was not the man - A. Yes; that I did, and they also asked if there was any other woman there besides me; the man unknown was also in the shop.Q. Was he behind the counter at the time - A. Not at the moment, but he was coming down stairs.Q. Did you see that man before or after Purton said,""That is not the man"" - A. I think it was before; I cannot say whether he was present. or not.COURT. Q. On your oath, was not that man, whom you call""unknown,"" called by some Christian or Sirname - A. I do not answer that.Q. You can answer Yes, or No. - A. Then I must answer Yes; I called him by the name he went by, and the prisoner called him by that name also.Q. Did you advise that person not to give a name. - A. I never advise any thing. ANTHONY HARRISON . I am a Marshalsman of the City. I went with Purton, on the 27th, to apprehend the prisoner, at Carlile's shop; there was no name in the warrant. Purton was to go into the shop, and if he stopped I was to go in directly; I did - he was buying a book of the prisoner, and pointed to him. I took him; he gave a nod, and I lifted up a flap to stop him going into the room; I told him I had a warrant against him. Purton did not say""That is not the man."" I had two warrants; the lady asked me to let him stop and dine. I said the Magistrate was sitting, and if he was gone he would be locked up till next day - she asked me a good many times to let him stop to dinner, and called the man down whose name is unknown, and then he put his hat on, and came away with me. When that man came down, Purton said""That is not the man.""Defendant. Q. Did not Purton swear he bought the pamphlet of me the day before, that is the 26th - A. I do not know; I signed my name on the book he bought on the 27th - my name is not on the one produced.COURT. Q. In consequence of there being no name in your warrant, Purton went to shew you who the man was - A. Yes; he would not give his name at the first examination.JURY to PURTON. When did you buy the pamphlet produced in Court - A. On the 26th, here is my memorandum on it""Bought on 26th of December, of a short stout man, at the shop of R. Carlile."" I wrote this within a quarter of an hour; before it was out of my possession; I have not written on the one bought on the 27th - there was no man in the shop like him, and I have seen him in the shop before.

PRENDERGAST conducted the prosecution. WILLIAM HATHERSTON . On Saturday night, the 17th of February, about half-past twelve o'clock, my business caused me to be in Clare-market. I was coming home, and was going into a public-house in Drury-lane, near the burial ground, to get a pint of beer; the two prisoners came towards me, and as Caps passed, he seized my watch-chain, and took it out. I seized him and called to the watch, Callahan came to his assistance, and got him from me. I then seized Callahan, he pulled me across the road, and as I was calling Watch! he called to Caps for assistance, and said,""Don't go away,"" Caps, then came and joined him. I was contending with them both, they got off, and my wife and myself called out Watch! the constable came up and rushed among the crowd, and took me into a shop - I was bleeding, I said I should know the man again, and went to look for them in Queen-street, and on coming into Drury-lane, Jones pointed over the way; I saw Caps run over, I said,""That is the man who robbed me."" Callahan was taken the same night in Drury-lane, about one o'clock - I am certain they are the men.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are you - A. I buy bread of bakers, and carry it about to sell - I deal with several people. Sir Richard Birnie examined me twice on this business.Q. Did not Sir Richard Birnie say""I do not like your story, why not call out that you were robbed, instead of not speaking till the watchman came?"" He did, and asked me to bring somebody to confirm my story.MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You did not take the witnesses who are now to be examined - A. They went to Marlborough-street by mistake, and when they got to Bow-street, it was too late. DAVID JONES . On Saturday night, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in Drury lane, and saw the prosecutor holding Callahan, who was striking him; Caps was standing by, they came into the middle of the street, when Caps seized the prosecutor and turned him on one side - the prosecutor kept calling for the watchman all the time. They got on the pavement, and the prosecutor seized Caps again, but they escaped, and went down Stewards rents; I followed them, but not knowing the man was robbed, I turned back. After hearing he was robbed, I went after them, and in Wild-street I saw Caps; he saw me, and went into Little Wild-street, then took to his heels and ran off - I followed him across Queen-street, into Drury-lane, and then turned back; the prosecutor and constable then came up - I pointed him out, and the prosecutor said""That is one of the men who robbed me.""Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. A tailor. I did not know the prosecutor, he had cried Watch! but not Stop thief! when the watchman came up, he said,""I have been robbed of my watch."" I said,""It is odd you should fight with the man so long, and not say you was robbed."" Caps ran away as soon as he came. JOHN ELSWORTH . I am a constable of St. Giles's. About twenty minutes after twelve o'clock, I was going to bed, but heard a violent cry of""Watch! Watch! I will not let him go;"" considering that there was a watchman near, I did not go out immediately; but as the cry continued, I went and found the prosecutor covered with blood - I took him into a baker's shop, he said he had lost his watch. The people were complaining that no watchman was to be found, there ought to have been three near the spot. As soon as I got up, there was a rush down Stewarts-rents; I ran round into Wild-street, and Drury-lane, and just at the corner, the prosecutor ran across, and stopped Caps, who was going towards Broad-court, he said,""This is the man,"" I immediately collared him, and said,""Harry, it is you."" The prosecutor said he should know the other man, and Bartlett said he had seen a man with Caps, who he knew; a person fetched us to the corner of Clare-court, where Bartlett took Callahan; he said to Bartlett,""I'll go with you, you have been a friend to me, if I had taken your advice, I should not have been in this.""Cross-examined. Q. The prosecutor said he was ill used - A. Yes. I asked if he had lost any thing, he said his watch; he was confused. The people thought it was a fight. THOMAS BARTLETT . I am a street-keeper. I saw Elsworth having Caps in custody - the prosecutor said he was concerned in robbing him of his watch; he described the other man; I said I thought I knew him, and went down Clare-court, and saw Callahan, I secured him, and said,""Caps is in custody, charged with a robbery, with you;"" he said,""Bartlett if I had taken your advice, and gone home, this would not have happened.""Cross-examined. Q. How far is the burial ground from Broad-court - A. Thirty or forty yards. Callahan was all over dirt. Sir R. Birnie said the prosecutor's wife need not come here. PHILIP SMITH . I am a patrol. On Sunday morning, I saw the prosecutor turning out of a public-house, in Drury-lane - I heard of this affair, and saw Caps in Broad-court, the prosecutor said,""That is one of them,"" he said that he had nothing to do with it. WILLIAM JACKSON . I am a patten maker, and live in Wych-street. I was coming down Drury-lane, and by the burial ground, I saw the prosecutor and Callahan wrestling, he got away; Caps came between them, and forced them, apart and both ran down the court - I went with the constable after them round Wild-street; he went over the way and collared Caps. I went with them to the watch-house, and saw Callahan standing near Clare-court - I knew him directly, and pointed him out; I had heard the prosecutor calling out,""Watch! You shall not go;"" they were struggling together - Callahan said nothing when he was taken.Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear him charged with a robbery - A. No. The impression on my mind was that it was a robbery. The prosecutor was holding the man, not fighting with him. Elsworth came up just as the men got away.CAPS - GUILTY .

I am cryer to Lord Chief Justice Dallas. I remember this case being tried, and administering the oath to the defendant. I heard him examined as witness for the plaintiffs.MR. WILLIAM B. GURNEY , I am a short-hand writer. I attended and took notes on the trial of this cause, and have an examined copy of the defendant's evidence. I examined it word for word.Q. Just turn to where he speaks of the delivery of the parcel - A. He was asked whether he had a parcel to carry to Russell's warehouse - he said he had three to carry out that day, the 1st of December, 1820; that he received the parcel in question from Mr. West, Sir J. Perring's clerk - that he went to the Swan-with-two-Necks, and delivered the two others, and then went to Russell's office, with the third, the one in question, and got there not much after seven o'clock in the evening - that the first person he saw there was a working man, who loads the waggon, he desired to be served first - laid down the parcel, and came away - and was certain that the parcel he received from West was the same he delivered. He was asked, on cross examination,""Do you know a person named Nightingale - A. Yes, my Lord. Q. Is he a man with one arm - A. Yes. Q. And very red whiskers - A. Yes."" He could not exactly say how long he had known him, not to be intimate with him - he first saw him about three years ago. He is then asked. Q.""He did not go to the waggon-office with you - A. No. Q. I mean at the time the parcel was delivered by you at Russell's office, was or was not Nightingale there - A. No."" Nightingale was then called forward close to the witness, and he was asked,""Is that Nightingale - A. Yes. Q. Was he or not with you on the 1st of December, when you went to the office - A. He was not. Q. I understand you to swear positively, that he was not at Russell's waggon-office with you - A. He was not.""

You did not observe anybody in the office -A. No. Q. If there had been you must have seen them - A. Yes."" He said he observed nobody but the bookkeeper, and two persons at the door. He had before spoken of these two persons having called about a parcel.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you take down the re-examinations, and all the cross-examinations - A. Yes.Q. Is there nothing in them that will give any explanation - A. No, nothing that I recollect.- WEST. I am clerk to Sir John Perring - Messrs . Shields & Johns were correspondents of ours; they are bankers at Plymouth Dock - their notes are payable at Sir John Perring 's. On the 1st of December, 1820, I made up a parcel of their notes to be transmitted to Plymouth-Dock. It is usual, on the 1st of every month to return all we have collected in the preceding month. I produce a book which will shew what notes I packed up. The entry is not my own writing. I compared the sums with the entry, but not the numbers. The notes are paid daily, and in the evening they are pinned together and entered in this book, I compared the amounts. I packed up in this parcel 1316 l., and put Sir John Perring 's seal on the parcel, after tying it in cartridge paper, and directed it to Messrs. Shields & Johns, Plymouth-Dock, on the left hand side. I made it up in the morning, put it in the strong box, and I think between half-past four and half-past five, delivered it to Painter, to be delivered at Russell's warehouse.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you certain it was between half-past four and half-past five o'clock - I cannot say positively, it might be something later - it might be near six. I delivered him three parcels.Q. And after, that he had to go with letters to the post-office - A. It was his duty to deliver letters. I believe he took the letters out with the parcels - it depends on his own arrangements whether he would go to the coach or waggon-office first; his general custom was to take the letters and parcels together - I counted every note.Q. How long has the defendant been in the banking-house - A. I have been there ten years, and I believe he was there before me. He was entrusted to receive large sums, as receiving clerk, and was scrupulously punctual in his accounts. I always considered him strictly honest. RICHARD TILLETT . I am clerk at Sir J. Perring's banking house. It is my duty to enter the country notes paid at the counter. I have examined the book, and find entries of different notes of Shields and Co. paid in Nov. 1820. I deliver the notes I receive to Mr. Vile, who delivers them to West - we pin them together, and enter the numbers in this book, and pin them up in parcels. I have here an account of all notes of Shields and Co. received that month; the whole amount is 1316 l.; and I find by the book, that on the 5th of December, 110 l., 130 l., and 50 l. of the same notes were presented and repaid.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are the notes given to you, or handed over by another clerk. - A. They are paid by the cashier, who puts them in a drawer - I compare them with the counter book, to see that they agree, and then enter them. I find above 1000 l. of the same notes were repaid before the 15th of December.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know whether all notes issued by Shields and Co. are following numbers, or whether old notes are re-issued. - A. I cannot say. I only took the numbers, not the dates. I do not recollect ever seeing two of the same number. AMBROSE COCK . I am cashier of Sir John Perring 's. I pay the notes at the counter, and have examined the book produced. I find by my entry of 5th of December, that I paid one lot of notes 110 l., another of 130 l., the numbers of which notes correspond with those put in the parcel. On the 6th of December, I paid 160 l. more of them, and most of the rest come from bankers at the clearing house.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You cannot say from memory whether the notes you paid had been in before. - A. Certainly not; only by examining the book I find the same numbers were paid. I cannot say whether I have met with two notes of the same number. JOHN CHASE . I am clerk at Russell and Co.'s waggon office, No. 12, Friday-street, and have been so nearly six years. It is my business to receive parcels and book them. On the 1st of December I recollect the defendant coming to the office with a parcel, and knew him before. He came about eight o'clock in the evening - we have no dial in the office, but I say it was near eight o'clock, because we were to have a supper that night at eight o'clock. He had a person with him, whom I afterwards saw at Guildhall - it was Nightingale; he had but one arm, and very red whiskers. I am quite sure he was with him. Painter produced a parcel to me, and paid 1 l. 2 s. 8 d. insurance on it. I locked it up immediately in an iron safe at the top of the warehouse, in the counting-house. I keep the key - there were four or five other valuable parcels there, worth 1400 l. or 1500 l. together. This parcel was insured for 450 l. I put it in the waggon, on Saturday afternoon, about four o'clock. I had kept the key all the time, and took it out of the safe about four o'clock, and locked it with the other valuable parcels in a strong box in the waggon, and saw the goods loaded over it - there was 95 cwt. put over it.Q. At the time Painter brought it, did any thing pass between you - A. Yes; two persons came into the office nearly at the same time as him, to enquire about a parcel from Bridport; I referred to the weigh-bill and found no such parcel. Painter blamed me for not attending to him first, and asked if I meant to keep him all night; he did not ask for any thing to drink, though he generally did on other occasions, and he used not to appear in a hurry - the waggon left our office, at five o'clock on Sunday morning, the 3d of December - Willis was the waggoner, and Bury the guard; it arrives at Plymouth in about ten days, there was nothing to be delivered till he got to Blandford, where he would arrive on Wednesday the 6th. I never heard any complaint of the loss of the other valuable parcels.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. The parcel was brought about eight o'clock in the evening - A. Yes; on Friday; I did not say, at Guildhall, that it was about seven o'clock; it was between half-past seven and eight - I did not say the key hung on a nail, that was the key of the strong box of the waggon. I did not know either of the two persons who called about the parcel; I never saw them afterwards - there were two people at the door, named Hodder and Maize, and who were examined at Guildhall.MR. WALFORD. Q. The key of the strong box would be of no use to any body - No; it would take four or five men four or five hours to unload the waggon. I did not leave it till it was loaded. DANIEL HOLLAND . I have been a porter at Russell's warehouse sixteen or seventeen years, and I recollect the night Painter was there with the parcel; I knew him before - I remember this night, because we had a supper given us; I am sure Nightingale was with him, he has but one arm, and very red whiskers; I stood at the window at the time they were there, and had seen Nightingale before. There was a very bright gas-light in the office, and outside too - they came about half-past seven o'clock. WILLIAM MAIZE . I was groom to Mr. Russell. I had lived between two or three years there. I knew Paynter, and remember his coming to the office that evening, on account of the supper being given us; he came in with a person, whose name I know to be Nightingale, he had but one arm, and red whiskers. THOMAS WILLIS . I am waggoner to Messrs. Russell, and drive from London to Blackwater, which is thirty-three miles. I drove on the Sunday morning, and left at Blackwater, on Monday morning, about eight o'clock - nothing was taken out while it was under my care. ROBERT BURY . I was guard, and travelled with Willis; nothing was taken out while I was with it. JOHN HOARE . I was waggoner to Messrs. Russell, for ten years. I received the waggon at Blackwater, and drove it eighteen miles, to Wortling - it stops there, to be taken by Frampton, who comes from Andover; nothing was taken from it while under my care. I left it between four and five o'clock on Monday evening. DANIEL FISHER . I am a horsekeeper, at Worthing, in Mr. Russell's service, and have been so four or five years. I received the waggon, and watched it till about three o'clock in the morning, when Frampton drove it away. JOHN FRAMPTON . I am a waggoner, in Mr. Russell's service, and have been so twenty-three years. I received the waggon from Fisher, and drove it to Salisbury. I got there at eight o'clock on Tuesday night - nothing was taken out while I was there. OLIVER VILE . I am clerk at Sir John Perring 's. I receive the notes on the evening of the day; they are brought in, I deliver them to Mr. West, and did so with Shield's notes, in November, 1820. I am sure all the notes paid in November, were locked up, and afterwards delivered to West. I never heard of two notes of the same number and amount - I have been twelve years in the house.MR. WEST, re-examined. I was present at the trial at Guildhall. This was produced in the defendants presence, as the parcel delivered at Plymouth (looking at it), it was shewn to Painter, the seal on it is not the genuine seal of Sir John Perring ; it resembles it - the P. S. and Co. on it, but I can say it was not made by Sir John Perring 's seal; and the direction on the parcel is not my writing, and it is not the cover which I put the notes in - I do not know whose writing it is.The parcel produced contained nothing but paper. JOHN CHASE . To the best of my recollection. this is the parcel delivered to me by Painter.MR. WILLIAM MACHINSON . I was agent to the plaintiff's attorney, when the case was tried. This is the parcel produced at Guildhall.Mr. Alley addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendant. JAMES PITT . I live in New Broad-street, city. On the 1st of December, 1820, my wife was ill. I had been accustomed to leave a person named Nightingale to nurse her, and went to Compton-street, Clerkenwell, after her. I knew John Nightingale by having been to that house three or four times before, for his mother. I consider it to be about six o'clock when I got there, and my motive for thinking so is, I usually take tea at five, which would last about half an hour, and I think it would take half an hour to go there; it is a chandler's shop - Nightingale was in the shop. I staid there about an hour, and left a little after seven.Q. From the time you went in till you quitted the house had Nightingale been out - A. I did not observe him out, and think if he had gone out his wife must have gone into the shop. I think it quite impossible that he could have gone to Friday-street.MR. WALFOOD. Q. Did you look at any clock or watch - A. No. I have three children, one living in Whitechapel, one at Cambridge, and one at Sheerness.Q. At the hulks - A. I am not bound to answer that question.

I do not recollect the day he came; as near as I can guess, about six o'clock in the afternoon. Nightingale, my son, was at home. I had let my apartments the day before, and had been robbed, and went to consult him, whether I should leave the house or continue in it. I do not know what month it was, but I was robbed the day before, which was Thursday. I went there about four o'clock, and staid till the shop was shut up, about ten o'clock.Q.

WALFORD. Q. You know your husband is indict - ed A. Yes . I was not at Guildhall.JURY. Q. What reason have you for recollecting the day Pitts called - A. On account of my mother being robbed on the day before. JOHN NIGHTINGALE . I am indicted here for perjury. On the 1st of December, 1820, I lived in Compton-street;my mother came to me on business, and Pitt came that day for her to go to nurse his wife - he came about six o'clock, and staid an hour, or an hour and a half. I was not out of the house, except going to the public-house, till bed time.MR. WALFORD. Q. How long had you know Pitt - A. About three years. I had visited him at Sir John Perring 's, two or three times before the loss of this parcel, but not since. JOHN HARE , re-examined. Q.

When they came between my shop and the next, one of them turned round, and said.""This is the shop,"" pointing to the next door; this drew my attention. They went on to the cornerof Tufton-street. Soon after, in consequence of what somebody said, I went to the house, and alarmed the people; a great crowd collected in a short time, and in the crowd, I saw the two prisoners; there were sixty or seventy people - I am sure they are two of the three I saw go by my house.

I am an inmate of his house - he was not at Greenford on the night in question, Tuesday the 18th of February; I was there, and went to bed about half-past ten o'clock. I saw all the windows and doors fast, and secure. I was disturbed a little before two o'clock, by the barking of a little dog, and by a noise of knocking of the inner doors, and hearing footsteps in different parts of the house, I got up and went down stairs undressed, with a double barrelled gun; I opened my door as cautiously as I could, and immediately heard footsteps going down stairs, and when I had got down about six steps, a light went across the hall, and I observed two or three figures pass; I fired one of my barrels, and pursued them into the dining-room - there is a window which opens on to the lawn, and as they went through there I pulled the trigger of the other barrel, but it missed fire. I followed them through the window on the lawn, and pulled the trigger again, and it missed fire again - I then saw two men together, and one seperate; two of the men followed the gravel walk, the other went through a clump; I immediately lost sight of him. I drove the two towards a quickset hedge, which they dashed through, it was six feet high on the inner side, and eight on the other. I heard some one going over the pailing, and as I returned to the house, I stumbled over a pair of shoes and a hat, which I took up, and carried to my bed-room - I then got a light, dressed myself, and sent the servant to alarm Hughes the gardener; I got him, King the constable, and Hunt the carter; I sent King and Hughes in one direction - I mounted my horse and went another way. I found a crow bar in the study, under my bed-room, also a dark lanthorn.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You are not in partnership with Mr. Condell - A. No. I have retired from the army. THOMAS HUGHES . I am gardener to Mr. Condell. I was called up, and went with King into the Uxbridge-road, and about a mile from my master's house, I took Naylor, he was walking on the foot-path, in company with Adams, whom King secured; the constable searched Naylor in my presence, and found three silver forks and two cruet tops on him. I did not see Adams searched; I saw him strike the constable.Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What time was this - A. About three o'clock in the morning, it was a dark night. I can swear to Adams; I had a good opportunity of seeing him - his face was close to mine when King collared him, I noticed his features, and person most particularly; he was without his shoes; King held him a minute or two, he then gave him a violent blow on the head, and got from him - he was taken the same morning. JOSEPH HUNT . I am carter to Mr. Condell. Mr. Platt called me up, I did not go in pursuit. On the morning after the robbery, I searched all round the premises, and traced where they went through the edge, it was broken quite down, and in the same trace down the meadow, nearly two hundred yards from the edge, I found a table cloth spread, and a clock, some silver candlestands, cruet-frames, and between four and five dozen of knives and forks, all covered over with a baize table-cover - I looked round and three or four flint stones laid at the corner, close to the house, and a glass decanter, half full of brandy; and just in the centre of the house, were three or four more flints, a bottle of gin, and the iron bar of the window; it was about twenty yards from the window. I was going to town that morning with a load of hay, and when I came into Kensington, I saw Bowles, (Mr. Epley's carter). I walked with him, and told him of the robbery, and in consequence of what he said, I looked and saw the prisoner Adams in his cart, and noticed some small pips on his hat, as if from a hedge, and his coat was torn on his left shoulder, there was also a green mark on his shoulder; he had neither shoes or stockings on. I got Pugh who was going to town, to secure him, we got in the cart, and handed him down.Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you search him - A. Yes; and found a loaded pistol in his left hand trowsers pocket. WILLIAM KING . I live at Greenford. I went with Hughes, and met Adams and Naylor, I believe it to be Adams, but cannot positively swear to his features. Hughes took Naylor, whom I afterwards searched. When I came up, I said,""Good morning gentlemen,"" they said, ""Good morning;"" I said,""Where do you come from,"" they said,""What odds is it to you,"" I said,""A great deal,"" and by this time, I saw that the man, whom I believe to be Adams, had neither stockings or shoes on - he resisted greatly when I seized him; he thrust his hand into his right hand pocket, I ordered him to take it out, which he did, and I threw him on the path - he begged me not to ill-use him, I said,""Then be civil,"" he said,""I will,"" he resisted again, and put his hand into his left-hand breeches pocket - I felt and found what appeared to me a pistol, I held it fast, he resisted, and we struggled till we got from one side of the road to the other, and then he pulled some weapon from his right hand pocket, and gave me a blow on the head, which caused me to lose my hold of the pistol, and he got away. I staggered but did not fall down - my head had a cut between two and three inches long. I then went to assist Hughes. I observed Adams coat was torn on his left shoulder before I seized him. I searched Naylor at the cage, and found the property mentioned in his pocket. I then went to the Green Man, public-house, Ealing, and saw Thompson the landlord, and in consequence of what he told me I went after a cart towards town, and met Platt at Shepherds Bush, and about half way down Notting-hill, I found a cart, which I searched, and found Ward and Anson; it was an open hay cart; they were under the cloth which covers the hay - I found nothing on them. I have 3 forks and 2 cruet-tops which I found on Naylor.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How far is Notting-hill from London - A. About two miles.

I am a constable. Ayres gave me two knives and a fork. WILLIAM PLUMRIDGE . On the Monday before the house was robbed, I and Wm. Harris were going towards London, with five hundred bricks, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw four men together on the road, it was the four prisoners; they were going down the road towards Greenford, near the Black Lion, public-house; they were playing with oranges, one of the oranges came against the foot of my horse; I kept it and eat it, and this made me observe them.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. In whose employ are you - A. Mr. Hitchcock's. They were on the Bayswater-road. I cannot say whether they were a mile or more from town. I should not particularly have noticed them if the orange had not been thrown at my horse; there was nobody else near - I saw them for four or five minutes. I stopped rather behind my horses - I know them by their features and dress. I told the Magistrate that I knew them most by their dress.WILLAM HARRIS. I am carter to Mr. Benson, of Brook Green. On the afternoon of the 18th, I was with Plumridge at Bayswater, and saw four men playing with oranges - Auson is one of them, I am sure; I did not take so much notice of the other three, as they kept on. THOMAS RAWLINSON . I am the driver of the Birmingham coach. On the 18th I was between the 4th and 5th mile stone, between eight and nine o'clock, and saw four men together, and two at a distance behind them - two of the four were smoking, they were about two yards from each other; Anson and Ward were smoking. I have not the least doubt of the four prisoners; I was going very slow, as I had a heavy load. I had lights to my coach.Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS. Q. It was a dark night, and you only saw them by your lights - A. I saw them plainly, I met them; I was coming to town, and noticed them particularly.Q. Did you not hesitate about them before the Magistrate - A. I said I would not positively swear to them, but I looked at them, and felt more positive, and had no doubt of them - they had changed their clothes then. I said I would not swear positively, but believed them to be the men.COURT. Q. Your lamps reflect forward, did they reflect on their countenances - A. Yes. The darker the night is the better my light shews. I looked particularly at them, and cautioned the guard to take care of the hind boot, as we had been repeatedly robbed. JOHN SPURGEAR . I am a hostler. I received a load of hay from Birch, on the 19th of February. I examined the trusses minutely, and found a centre-bit in one of them, I gave it to Plank. It was without a stock.

I bound the hay myself; there was nothing in it - As I came to town I took up Ward and Anson, by the seven mile stone, and at Notting-hill turnpike. King took them out of my cart. JOHN LOVICK re-examined. The centre-bit was given to me, I took it to the house, and compared it with the holes; it appeared that they were were made by it. JOHN HARVEY . I am horse-keeper at the Old Hatts, on the Uxbridge-road. About four o'clock on the morning of this robbery, I met Anson and Ward at the Old Hatts, where I change my horses; they asked their way to London, and said they had come from Twickenham, and lost their way - I told them to go straight on, and went with them, to the Green Man, and got them some hot, and two pipes of tobacco; they went away in Birch's hay cart. I noticed that they had handkerchiefs tied over their mouths, and their hats over their eyes, and they would not walk into the house to warm themselves, but drank the hot at the door. JAMES BOWLES . I am carter to Mr. Epley. On Tuesday the 19th of February, I saw the prisoner Adams at Brentford, about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning; he asked me to let him ride to town, and said he would give me a pot of beer; he had no shoes on. He said he had been tipsy overnight, and had lost his shoes; he had none on. He was taken into custody at Knightsbridge. SAMUEL PLANK . I am an officer. Early on the morning of the 19th Feb. I went down and examined the house. Naylor was delivered into my custody at Hanwell, and at Mr. Condell's house, Mr. Platt gave me a pair of shoes, a hat, a dark lanthorn, a crow bar, and a glove. I examined Naylor's person, and found several scratches on his hands, which appeared recently inflicted, as there was a discharge from them - he would not tell me how they came so. I then asked him how he came by the plated articles found in his pocket? he said he had come from Uxbridge early that morning, and about half a mile of the other side of Hanwell, he came up with a man without shoes, and that man asked him to carry those articles for him, which he did, and shortly after, near a cross road, two men came up, and took them both into custody; that he surrendered, but the other man without shoes knocked down the man who took him, and got off. He was very dirty, his knees were muddy both before and behind. I took him to the office, and soon after Adams was given into my charge; he had no shoes or stockings on, his trowsers were very muddy, and his left-hand trowsers pocket nearly torn off; his coat was torn in the left arm. Upon taking his coat off I found several small holes like shot holes had passed through the tall; the shoes which Mr. Platt delivered me were tried on his feet, they fitted him. I took him to the back of the office where Naylor was confined, and asked Naylor if he knew him, and at the same time told him I should give his answer in evidence; he said,""That is the man who gave me the plated articles, which were found in my pocket, and the same who struck the person who took him, and made his escape."" Adams denied it, and said he did not know him at all, and had never seen him in hislife. Naylor said he was the man - a pistol was produced before the Magistrate; I found it was loaded with two balls, and primed - I unloaded it. I received Anson and Ward in charge at Mary-le-bone watch-house, and examined their persons; and found their hands scratched in the same way as Naylors, and a little bloody, and their clothes very muddy. I took Adams into their presence; he said he knew neither of them, and they said they had never seen each other in their lives. Ward and Anson said they had been tumbling about, which made them so muddy. I produce Adam's coat, also a dark lanthorn, a crow, and a hat, which was tried on, but fitted neither of them well.Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Naylor always gave the same account - A. Yes. The place he says he met Adams at, is about a mile from the house. The shoes would have fitted Adams if his stockings were on.MR. PLATT re-examined. My gun was loaded with small shot. I conceive, from the appearence of the premises, that there were five or six persons - I only saw three, but on the lawn in front, there were foot-marks and flint-stones, and a bottle of spirits, in two different places on the lawn, and the foot-marks were in two or three different places. ANN DAVIS . I lived servant to the prosecutor. Only I and my sister were at the house on this night. I produce the liquor and cruet-stand, which was brought in off the meadow; it is my masters, and was safe in the house that night. The rest of the property produced is also my master's. JOHN LOVICK re-examined. I cut a piece of the shutter out, which I produce with the centre-bit found in the hay. The holes in it appear to be made with this instrument.NAYLOR. I leave my Defence to my Counsel.ADAM'S Defence. I went to Staines to paint; I finished my job, got drunk, and laid down in the road; somebody stole my shoes and money - when I got up, I picked up the pistol, and put it in my pocket.WARD'S Defence.

ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution. GEORGE GARDNER . I keep the Fortune of War, public-house, Giltspur-street, West Smithfield, in the parish of St. Sepulchre. On the night of the 5th of April, I was the last person up, and saw the house completely fastened. I went to bed about twelve o'clock. Under the window which fronts the street, there is a door, which opens for the drovers to put their ropes in; it was fastened by a lock. I was called up at three o'clock by the watchman, and found this door forced, and the lock off; there is a door inside, opening into this place, and that was also forced open, I am sure it was safe overnight - the inner door had not been opened for five years; it leads into the bar, and on examining the bar, I found an empty drawer standing on the counter, which had been robbed of between 5 s. and 10 s. worth of copper; it was in its proper place over night. I then found another till taken away, with about 45 s. in copper in it; the lock of a door in the bar was picked, which was locked when I went to bed, and the bar parlour had been entered, and from a cupboard there, was taken two table and six teaspoons, a pair of sugar tongs, a cream pot, a pair of salt-spoons, and a punch ladle, all silver; and 6 plated spoons, two table cloths; and a bundle was taken from a dresser, which did not belong to me. The value of the whole is about 7 l. with the money. The watchman took me to a court within two doors of my house, and in that court was a privy; the floor of which was taken up, and the whole of the articles and money stated in the indictment where found down there, but only part of the copper. Newman brought me a small crow-bar and chisel two hours after.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The privy does not belong to your house - A. No. The court leads to two private houses, and the privy belongs to them; I do not know whether it is always left open. The tills were in their proper places at night - the outer door of this place door was locked; one drover, named Nicholls, has a key; it was not a night on which he would have occasion to come there. I tried the door on this night, and found it safe - if that had been open, they would have to force the inner door. ROGER HOGAN . I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre. On the night in question I was near Cock-court; was walking by my box, which is opposite Cock-lane, and the Fortune of War, - the court is two doors below, down Cock-lane. At half-past two o'clock, Bartho-lemew came over to me; he appeared to come out of the side door of the Fortune of War, in Cock-lane; he said,""Watchman it is a cold morning,"" I said,""We cannot complain for the time of year;"" he said,""I am locked out, I live down at the bottom of the lane,"" I said,""Can't you make themhear,"" he said, he did not like to disturb them - we talked for near half an hour; he kept his eye on the Fortune of War - I went down Cock-lane, at three o'clock to cry the hour; he remained by my box. I came out of the lane into Giltspur-street, and down a court to cry the hour; I took off my hat, having suspicion of him, and looked out of the court, and saw him cross over to the Fortune of War. I went into Cock-lane, and could see nothing of him; presently I heard a gingle, which seemed to proceed from the court, where the two houses are; then Close came out of the court - I crossed over and asked what he was doing there; he said he lived there; I said I thought he did not, he persisted that he did, and wanted me to go in and see that he did; I took him by the collar, and said I would take him to the watch-house, and have him examined, but as he persisted that he lived there, I let him go, and he went up the court, which is no thoroughfare; I remained at the end. Cook (a watchman) came up; I placed him there to prevent any one coming out while I went to the watch-house for a reinforcement - I brought Godfrey, and found Cook at his post; we went up the court, looked about, and could see nobody; presently Cook put his stick through a hole in the privy door, and said there were persons there; we demanded entrance, but could not obtain it, then we heard a noise inside like breaking of wood; we broke in at the door, and found the prisoners there; we secured and took them to the watch-house; then returned to the privy to see if we could find any thing; I looked about the yard, found nothing, and put my lantern down the privy, and discovered linen, plate, and broken wood, down in the soil. We went to the Fortune of War, and found the side door open - I had examined that door before one o'clock, and found it safe. We alarmed Mr. Gardner; he got up, and looked over his house; we took him to the privy, I got a chisel and hammer, pulled up the floor, and found the property stated in the indictment there, and gave them to Godfrey.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. At what time did you first see Bartholemew - A. At half-past two o'clock - he appeared quite sober; he did not ask leave to sit in my box, or where he could get a night's lodging; he was alone then. He asked if we allowed people to sit in the watch-house, I said""No, provided we found you drunk or at housebreaking, we would give you a night's lodging."" I knew there was a privy in this court; any one might get to it, it has only one seat, I believe.COURT. Q. Had you observed any body go up the court from the time you first saw Bartholemew, till you heard the gingle - A. No, my Lord. GEORGE GODFREY . I am the inspector of the watch. Hogan fetched me to the court in Cock-lane. I found Cook standing as a sentry; we all three went up, and all was silent; we looked about and found nobody in the court or in the inner yard where the privy is; it is in an inner yard, which is enclosed by a door - it might have been left open. We found the privy door shut - Cook put his stick through; we forced it open, and found the prisoners there; Bartholemew came out first, and desired we would not use him ill; I laid hold of him; the other came out, and said the same and surrendered; we had not charged them with any thing. Before the door was open, we heard a great noise like the breaking of timber. We found the property; and some implements of housebreaking in a green bag in the privy. Previous to searching the privy, we took the prisoners to the watch-house. Both gave their names - Bartholemew gave his residence No. 30, Onslow-street, Saffron-hill, as a baker; I asked what he did in the privy; he said he went for a necessary purpose. Close said he had no residence in London; that he was a shoemaker, and had come from Devonshire that day. They were taken to the Compter. We then went and found Gardner's house broken open. We searched the privy immediately after taking the prisoners to the watch-house, and found the articles stated in the indictment; also a broken till, a green bag, containing 3 s. in silver, and seventeen picklock keys, 16 s. 4 3/4 d. in copper, and a chisel were picked up, a small box, and a bottle - and in the yard we found 8 d. in copper loose on the pavement. The property was given to Pike. On entering Gardner's house, by the door, we found a small dark lantern, and a large door key; a gimblet was stuck in the outer door under the window, with a string tied to it, which would enable them to keep the door close after they had got in; we found the lock of this door wrenched off, and the inner door open; there are two holes to the privy. THOMAS PIKE . I produce the property.MR. GARDNER. The property is all mine, and the till - I saw it all safe when I went to bed.BARTHOLEMEW'S Defence. I am totally innocent. I had been over the water with some friends, stopped late, and on coming home, about two o'clock, I was intoxicated - I found the street door locked, did not wish to disturb the other lodgers, and meant to walk about till morning. As I crossed Smithfield, this watchman stood with a man in his box, I asked if I might sit in the watch-house; he said the officers would not allow it - we talked a few minutes; I then went up the court into the privy, and to the best of my recollection fell asleep there. I never saw this person before, and to the best of my knowledge was never in Gardner's house in my life.Close made no Defence. GEORGE GODFREY re-examined. He appeared perfectly sober. THOMAS PIKE . When I saw him he appeared perfectly sober.Cross-examined. Q. Is it not the watchman's duty to go round and see if idle persons are in this privy - A. I believe it is, there are no directions given for it - it is the watchman's duty to search places where doors are open. There are privies at the watering houses for drovers to use. I know of no privies being left open. ROBERT COOK . I am the watchman who was left sentry at the court. The privy is only for the use of the two houses - no person could tell there was one there. I never saw a drover go there in my life; if a person was going along, and enquired for such a place, he might be informed there was one there; it is not a place a man is likely to find out at night. ELIZA HEMMINGS . My husband is a sawyer, and lives in St. George's-fields. I was told of this robbery on the Saturday. Bartholemew came to our house on Good Friday, he had a bad foot; I asked him to sit down till my husband came in, which he did till about eight o'clock - I asked if he was not hungry, and gave him some pork anda pint of porter. He stopped till half-past one o'clock - I believe he was rather intoxicated; he and my husband had three pots and a pint of beer between them; I had some of it - we were drinking from about nine to half-past one o'clock; he fell asleep part of the time in the arm chair, and I awoke him. I thought him intoxicated - he smoked three pipes; I asked him to stop, but he said he would go home to his wife and child. I have known him five or six years; he was an honest steady man. He lived some where about here, but where I do not know.One witness gave Bartholemew a good character.BARTHOLEMEW - GUILTY - DEATH . Aged 34.CLOSE - GUILTY - DEATH .

The prisoner Buckley came with James Wilson , (who is included in the indictment,) on 14th March, to look at some fur seal skins at my house; I shewed him about six. Buckley said he came with Wilson from Boxer and Co., and appointed the following morning for me to see him at Boxer and Co's office, No. 1, Pinner's Court, Broad-street. I attended there, and found Wilson sitting in a chair; it had the appearance of a merchant's counting-house. Wilson asked if I would give a little credit for the skins - he had said he should be a large buyer if we could agree. I said, if I sold them, I must have cash, and could give no credit; he appointed to meet me at two o'clock that day, at my house. Buckley was writing at the desk as a clerk, and within hearing.

I got a porter with a truck to take them, and sent my son with them. He brought the skins back in one hour and a half, directing me to be their the next morning before half-past ten o'clock. I got to Pinner's Court, about twenty minutes before ten with them. Buckley was sitting at the desk writing, and an elderly man was there. I asked if Mr. Wilson had been there. They said,""No."" I said,""Do you suppose he will be long."" Buckley said,""No, Mr. Wilsonseldom exceeds ten o'clock."" I waited a few minutes; said I will go to the end of the court to the porter, and perhaps I might see Mr. Wilson come up the street. I stood talking to the porter, and saw Mr. Wilson coming; he came up to me, and said""Good morning."" I said""I have brought the skins according to order."" He said""Let the porter deliver them, and I will pay you for them."" The porter put them down in the office. There were sixteen others, a little damaged besides, which I had in a bag to see if I could sell them, as he seemed anxious for skins. Buckley was there when they were delivered. I told Wilson there was a mistake of 3 s. in the invoice; he was to pay the portage; he took the invoice, and looked at it, and said""Very well, 3 s. is of no consequence."" I said""Will you look at these sixteen skins."" He did, and said""I will not purchase them now; we will leave them for the present till I have paid for the others."" I waited a few minutes for my money, and he said he had two heavy bills, and must wait till the office was open to get them cashed, which would be in the course of an hour. I said""I thought you would have been prepared with the money, my business is urgent, and I cannot leave home long together."" He said he was sorry to detain me, but the office would be open in an hour, and then he could get the cash. I said""I will wait then till you have the money."" The skins were still in the office. He left the office to get the money as I thought; Buckley still remained there. I waited some little time, and then walked to the end of the court, and returned; the skins were still in the office. Buckley said,""Take a seat, for Mr. Wilson will not be long."" While I stood at the end of the courtthe elderly man passed me, and on my return Buckley was alone in the office. I said""I suppose you know Mr. Wilson, don't you."" He said""Yes."" I said,""Is he a respectable man."" He said,""A very respectable man, and in an extensive way of business near Manchester."" I said,""Not in Manchester."" He said,""No."" I asked what place. I understood him to say Salford, about six miles from Manchester. In a few minutes the prisoner Levi came into the office, and bent his head over the railing of the desk, and said in plain English,""Have the goodness to tell Mr. Wilson he can have 200 l. at five o'clock."" This was near eleven o'clock. I took notice of him, he left the office. In a few minutes Wilson came in, and apologized for detaining me. I said I was sorry too, for my business was urgent at home, and I expected the money, and said,""It will not be long now before you get it."" I never intended to give up the goods without the money. He said he was sorry to detain me. I said,""If one of the two bills you have is not too heavy, and a good one, I will take my amount out of it, and give you the difference."" He said,""You are very polite, but I have left the bills at the banking-house, and should not like to take them away."" He took out his pocket-book, and said,""I have got a bill here, you see, but it is not of very large amount."" I leant my head over, and saw it was a bill. He said he could not get the money before three o'clock. I said""I thought that was very strange, that he ought to be prepared with the money. He proposed paying me at three o'clock. I said,""Then you cannot get the money."" He said,""No, not till three o'clock."" I took the sixteen skins, and put them in a brown holland bag, and put it on the rest of the skins, and said to Buckley,""Sir, these skins will be safe here till I return, or send my son?"" He said,""Yes,"" as I was to send for the money, if I could not come myself. I then hastened home.Q. Did you give them credit till three o'clock, or leave them on their assurance, that they would be safe till you had the money - A. It was about half-past eleven. I hastened home and instantly sent my son to the place to retain possession of the goods. It would take about quarter of an hour to go there. I told him to stay near the door till three, and then go in if I did not come - and if he could not get the cash to bring away the goods. He came home after three, and said we were robbed. I went to Pinner's Court, and found the clerks, the skins, and all the books gone, and nothing but a few wafers left. I made enquiry, and on Sunday Hewksley gave me information. I found 174 of the skins at Rose and Crown Court next morning, on the first floor. The sixteen skins were left behind in the counting-house. The prisoners were taken on Monday.Cross-examined by MR.

I never saw Levi till he came, and said Wilson might have 200 l. at five o'clock. HENRY A. WELLS . I am the son of the last witness. I went to Pinner's Court in the afternoon, and saw Buckley. I had the skins on a truck, in care of a porter. Buckley asked for an invoice, which I gave him. He then said Mr. Wilson was gone to drink tea with a gentleman (it was then a quarter-past four o'clock) and had left word for my father to come next morning at half-past nine with the skins. I came back, and next morning, about a quarter-past twelve, I went to the counting-house, and waited outside till three o'clock, and was to go in then if my father did not come. He did not, and I went in at three o'clock, and found nobody there, nor any skins, except the sixteen damaged ones. Books and every thing were gone. Nothing was taken out while I was waiting; they must have been gone before I get there. I returned and told my father. I was not above a quarter of an hour going from my father's to the counting-house. JAMES SELLING HEWKLEY . I am a ticket-porter, and live in Little Moorfields - my stand is at St. Lawrence Church. A person came to me at twelve o'clock, and said if I would go to No. 2, Pinner's Court, there was a job for me. I went, and when I got into the counting-house, the skins were delivered into my sheet by Buckley. I could get no answer where I was to take them to, but Levi went with me, having a few in a bag, when I got opposite Old Bethlem, I asked if he was going through the gates. He said""No; to Rose and Crown court."" He spoke very good English. My load was too bulky to get through the gate. He took me to a private house, No. 12, Rose and Crown Court. I untied them below; they were carried up to the first floor. He asked me what the job was. I said 1 s. 6 d. He gave me 1 s. 2 d. I saw some bills stuck up afterwards, which led me to Wells. I shewed him where I took the goods, and they were recovered. I am sure of the prisoner person. JOSEPH GREGORY . I am a constable. I apprehended Buckley in Rose and Crown Court, on Monday the 18th of March. I took him to the Mansion House; then went and took Levi in the same court.""I told him he must go with me.""

He denied it. I told him he must satisfy me what he had got in the paper, which I saw under his coat. - He answered nothing. I took this satin, fourteen yards, from him; it has our private mark on it; he seemed confused. I told him to follow me up into the warehouse. He said he would tell me all about it. I told him to say nothing to me; he said something which I paid no attention to, but told him to return to the cellar till Mr. Leaf came to town. He was taken in charge.Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did not his duty lead him to where the satin was kept - A. He swept part of the warehouse, but not where the satin was; the paper was not visible till after I spoke to him. He said he found it on the staircase under suspicious circumstances, and meant to tell his employers.Prisoner's Defence. (written). After eight weeks imprisonment, I am brought here for an offence I never committed, but did what I considered my duty. In sweeping the warehouse I frequently found goods where they ought not to be, and determined to acquaint Mr. Leaf of it, and in March I found these goods on the stairs and put it carefully in my pocket; it was visible to every one; the end of the paper hanging out. Is this the conduct of a theif; would any man in his senses place stolen goods in such a situation. RICHARD SMEETON . I never observed goods out of their proper places; I went up the stairs the night before this, after every one had left, and there was nothing. GUILTY . Aged 34.

THOMAS GILL . I live in the North Riding, Yorkshire. The property stated in the indictment was deposited in a strong room in Bridewell. I saw them last on the 23rd of August. I had the key of the box they were in; I saw some of it in the officer's possession on the 6th of April. JOHN HARPER . I am turnkey of Bridewell; the two prisoners were both prisoners there. Mr. Gill applied to me in August, and left a trunk in my care. I deposited it in the strong-room in the prison; the prisoners had no access to it. Early in February I was taken ill, and remained so till the 24th of March, when I returned to my duty, and on the 26th I found the door of the room had been opened, and the box broken open. I had not seen it since February; they were both prisoners there then. I watched and saw Green deliver a shirt and handkerchief to a woman, to get washed for him. Mr. Gill afterwards claimed them; an officer searched Dodd and on him found a shirt, marked T. G. which Mr. Gill claimed, and the stockings on his feet. I then searched Dodd's cell, and found two pair of sugar tongs; nobody but him was confined in that cell. I also found two pieces of silk, and two pair of stockings, in his cell, all claimed by Mr. Gill. I found nothing in Green's cell. I charged Dodd with it; he said he was very sorry any body was blamed besides himself; that he committed the robbery, but nobody but himself knew any thing of it. Green said he had the things of Dodd; he might go to the room unobserved in the day time. The locks must have been picked. Dodd was committed for two years from Guildhall Sessions, and made a wardsman in the prison.(Property produced and sworn to.)GREEN'S Defence. Dodd gave me the shirt to get washed for him.

I live at Hounslow; I knew John Edgcock . On the 18th of March I was at my chamber window, looking out, and saw the Gosport Coach stop on this side of the Marquis of Granby; the prisoner was on the box driving. Robert Mayers 's waggon came by, driven by the deceased, while the coach stood there; the waggon passed the Gosport Coach, and then the Malborough Coach came by; the waggoner's right hand was near the horses; the Malborough Coach was on the right hand side of the road; the Marquis of Granby is on the left, coming to London; the Malborough Coach passed on the right hand side, the deceased was passing on the left side of his horses, close against the body horse; the waggon was about three yards from the foot path; when the Malborough Coach drove by, the prisoner started directly on the left side, between the waggon and the left side, and as his coach passed the waggon, the box of the coach's hind wheel and the box of the waggon, came in contact together. The coach was going on faster than it ought; it got by the waggon somehow, and then the waggon horses set off full trot. The waggoner caught hold of his own trace harness, to prevent the coach going over him, and then the horses set off at full trot. The waggoner fell down, and his fore and hind wheels went over him.COURT. Q. You say there was only three yards between the waggon and the foot-path, did the coach go on the foot-path - A. No, it went very near it. I did not see the coach or horses strike against the deceased. The coach passed by my window, just as the boxes touched, I hollowed out very loud,""Coachman you must stop, or you will run over the man."" I ran down and stopped the waggoner's horses. He laid at the White Bear ten or twelve days and then died.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The waggon had to pass the Gosport Coach on its way to town - A. Yes, the road is wide enough for four or five to go abreast; the waggon was far enough out in the road. My window is about seventeen yards from the Granby; the left hand is the near side; the waggon had quite cleared the Gosport Coach before the coach started; the accident was about thirty-eight yards form the Granby; the coachman had passed the body of the waggon when the man fell, but not the horses. I did not see the waggon leader make a sudden start to the near side. I looked more to the waggon than the horses; I know the waggon leader is rather skittish.COURT. Q. The deceased caught hold of his trace harness - A. Yes, my Lord; he was pulled down. I saw him fall just as the coach passed him; I think the coach would have touched him, if he had not got close to his horses; he stepped half a yard out of the way; his own waggon ran over him, not the coach. SARAH ROE . I keep a Grocer's Shop at Hounslow. I stood at my door, which is seven houses from the Marquis of Granby, in the town, on the same side of the way. I saw the Gosport Coach at the Marquis of Granby; the driver was taking up a lady and gentleman. I saw the waggon come up to my door, and the Malborough Coach passed it very clear on the other side. I did not observe that it made the horses turn out of the way. At the time it passed the Granby, the driver of the Gosport Coach got on his box, and drove very fast indeed, on the left side, between the waggon; and as the waggoner was bearing very near towards our side, the coachman persisted in passing; and when they came opposite our door, the kennel being very low, I thought the coach would be over, as the waggon was so very near, there was scarce room for the coach to pass; the coach wheel went into the gutter, and made the coach leau over much towards my house; the waggoner got a little from my house, and how the accident happened I did not see. The body of the coach did not entirely pass the body of the waggon till it had passed my house; the coach being then between me and the waggoner, I could not see him. I afterwards saw him lay nine yards off. The waggon had then gone over him. There was room enough for him to have driven straight, and then it would not have happened.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not say the coach was so near the side, you were afraid it would be over - A. Yes. JEFFREY SIMPKIN . I am hostler at the Marquis of Granby. I was at my lodgings, and saw the Gosport Coach at the Granby; the prisoner drove it. I went and stood by the horses, on the public house side of the way. I saw the rein of the Gosport Coach under the near leader's tail, and attemped to take it away, but the coachman started so quick before I could take it; he hit the wheel horse, and started at a goodish pace, not much faster then he ought to go, but coaches do go at a good pace. The waggon seemed to be over right the leaders head, but being afraid at seeing the rein under the horses tail, I did not take notice, fearing the leader would kick, and cannot say whether it could pass the waggon without danger, but it could not without the coach wheel going into the gutter. As it passed the waggoner, he went up scrambling to his horses traces to save himself, to get out of the way of the coach; then his horses took fright, and two of them turned right across the road, towards the Malborough Coach; this was before he fell; I cannot say whether the coach touched him or not; I saw him thrown down. The Malborough Coach being on the right side, I suppose turned the horses back again nearly straight; I think if the prisoner had gone on steady it would not have happened; or if he had gone on his right side of the road.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you see the prisoner off the box - A. No, the waggon had not quite cleared the coach when it was about to start; the waggoner was bearing on his left side, to let him pass on the right; he fell at the time the Malborough Coach passed; he laid hold of the traces, and I suppose was pulled down by the horses pulling on; the body of the coach was about ten yards from him; when he fell his left leg was behind his right, and he fell under his middle horse.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When his legs were entangled, was he falling - A. He was holding by his traces; the prisoner started with the leading reins in his hand, but they could not be strained so as to have a full command of his horses. He could not be off seeing the waggoner.MR. HENRY MONTAGUE GROVER . I am a solicitor. I was on the Hounslow Road, on horseback, passing on my own near side, which was the off side of the waggon; and as I approached the hind part of the waggon the prisoner appeared to have his horses in confusion. I don't knowwhether he was on the point of starting or not. He had drawn his horses up. He appeared to me to be intending to turn to his own side, which he ought to have done, being behind the waggon; but he turned his horses between the waggon and the curb on the left. I saw nothing afterwards, till I saw the man on the ground. His thigh was broken. He was taken away on a shutter. It gave me the impression that he was knocked down by the head of his horse.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was not the whole road open to the waggoner when he passed the Marquis of Granby - A. I did not see him pass. He was in his right place, and there was room for the prisoner to pass on his right side. HARRISON WILKINSON . I am a surgeon at Hounslow. I was called in immediately after the accident, and attended the deceased till his death. His right thigh was fractured. There was a severe contusion in the left thigh, and a deep wound in his leg. I have no doubt but that produced the fever which occasion his death. He died on the eleven or twelfth day. JOHN EDGCOCK . I am the son of the deceased. His name was John. He was 63 years old.Prisoner's Defence. I took up two passengers at the Marquis of Granby, and just as I started the waggon came on my off side. I immediately went on, and never touched him or his horses; but my reins getting under the leader's tail it sprung off faster than I wished, being a high blood spirited mare. I did not know the man had fallen till I got to the end of the town. ELIZA LANE . I live at Hounslow, and was examined before the Coroner. I was at Mrs. Ogleby's, and saw the coach pass close to the path. I saw the waggon fore-wheel knock the man down. The Gosport Coach had then passed about two lengths from the waggon before he fell.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the coach pass the waggon - A. The Gosport Coach had passed two lengths before I looked. He fell with his feet under the waggon. He was hitting the coach horses. Q. I thought the coach had passed before you looked. How could you see him hit the horses - A. The coach was more by the side of him at first. There was room for two persons to pass between the coach and waggon, at the time he was striking the horses. He was walking very slow when the wheel knocked him down; and his horses went slow. MARY DAVIS . My husband keeps the Marquis of Granby. The Gosport Coach just passed to take up a gentleman and lady. I stood to see the lady into the coach. The coachman was getting on his box, and the moment the passengers were in, the coach started. I saw the waggon on the other side of the coach. There was room for four to go abreast. The bodies of the coach and waggon were very near together. When it started there was room for the waggon to go further from the coach. I saw the coach pass the waggon about two yards off, and saw the waggoner catching at the chains of his waggon; and his horses began a trot. This was after the coach passed - I saw him fall. I think his foot slipped as he caught at the chain apparently to stop the horses. His leader had turned towards the coach as it was going by.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say when the coach started the body of the two were abreast - A. I think they must. There were three horses to the waggon, and only two abreast to the coach; I think I saw Simpkins there. I think the reins had caught. The waggon had not passed the body of the coach then. The accident happened forty or fifty yards off. Q. Then it is not true that the waggon horses were walking slowly, and the waggon knocked him down - A. No, it was trotting. The wheels knocked him down. There was room for the coach to pass; for it did pass. There was no danger - the coach went slowly at first - it neither galloped or trotted.MR. BRODRICK. Q. It started slow. How far did it go before it got into its usual pace - A. About twenty yards. WILLIAM SHEPPARD . I am horsekeeper at the Marquis of Granby. The coach stood there about half a yard from the footpath. The waggon came along very near it; there was plenty of room - three or four carriages might pass. The first horse of the waggon was before the coach when it started; the waggoner was walking on the near side of his horses, and the waggon body was opposite the coach fore-wheel. The coach set off very slow, at a shuffling trot; and after it passed the waggoner he laid hold of his chain - crossed his legs, and fell down. There was about a yard and a half, between the coach and waggon, when it passed. I should think there was four or five yards between the waggon and the curb.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see Simpkin - A. Not till after it was over. The coach went about ten yards at the shuffling trot. The accident happened forty or fifty yards off. The Gosport Coach was ten or fifteen yards beyond the waggon when it happened. The waggon was bearing on the coach, and I suppose the coachman hollowed out to him, and then he turned his horses out again. I was standing behind the coach. FRANCIS THOMAS . I am an ironmonger, and live at Maidenhead. I was a passenger on the Malborough Coach. Just as we got opposite the Marquis of Granby the Gosport Coach set off. The waggon was by the side of it. The bodies were nearly abreast, and I saw the deceased either strike, or attempt to strike the Gosport coachman with his long whip, and in consequence of the smack of the whip, as I suppose, the waggon horses went on a trot. I saw the deceased attempting to hold the traces of his waggon; he fell and both the waggon wheels went over his legs. The Gosport Coach was then several yards before the waggon. Our coach was beyond the waggon, and the Gosport Coach was before ours.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you sit - A. Outside, in front, on the near side, with my face towards the horses' heads. The coach started just as we got opposite it. There was no racing. I am positive the waggoner attempted to strike the coachman. Just as it was setting off he was near his hind horse. I have seen coaches pass well in less space, and without danger.MR. BRODRICK. Q. There was room enough to pass without danger. Quite sufficient - if he had been an active man he could have got out of the way. ROBERT MILLER . I came up just after the accident, and helped to take the man to the White Bear. He said he must die, and he believed his own horse knocked him down. ISAAC CARTER . I was standing at the door of the Marquis of Granby when the coach started. The waggonwas then a little behind the coach. There was something the matter with the reins, which detained the coachman a few seconds; and in that time the waggon drew up, and rather drew on him. The coachman was deprived of the reins of the near side. Somebody extricated them. He was then in the kennel, by the footpath - the waggon having drawn nearer on him. He said,""Daddy or father, hold off a bit."" He held off, and then the coachman pulled his horses out of the kennel further into the road; and just as he got past the waggon horse, the waggon leader horse shyed towards the side of the Marlborough Coach. I believe the horses got right of themselves, and went away in a smartish trot. It shyed at something on the off side. I saw the man with his legs crossed; he appeared feeble. I said,""that man will be under the wheel"" - I saw him catching at the chains; and it had such an affect on me, I closed my eyes for a few seconds, and then saw him fall on his left side. I don't attribute the accident to the prisoner's coach. I ran to the man's assistance, and assisted the medical gentleman as well as I could. When he was collected, I asked how he came by the accident. He said, his daughter told him, before he left home, he should die; that he knew his death was come; that he was knocked down by his own horse, and run over by his own wheels; that it was an accident, and could not be helped.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you tell the Coroner all this - A. I was not suffered to speak, or any one else, scarcely. NOT GUILTY .First Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice Burrough.",notGuilty,none

I am waterman at the coach-stand in Oxford-road, at the corner of Bond-street, On the 25th of February, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoner come along going towards Tyburn in a little cart, with nothing in it; he drove with reins, and only one horse, going at a fastish trot. He came very near me; I said,""Where are you going, are you going to run over us"" - he went a little further down, turned back, and came towards me; but not so fast; he stood and went back again towards Tyburn, at a fastish trot up the road. He came back in about an hour and a half fall gallop, whipping his horse all the way; I said,""For God's sake don't go so fast, you'll run over somebody,"" he did not answer, but kept whipping his horse - I was below Bond-street. I knew the deceased very well, his name was Barnard Downs ; he was an old man, and had swept the crossing between Bond-street and Vine-street, for thirteen years. He had a stooping gait. I saw him shoved down by the prisoner's horse and cart; he never stopped at all, but went on out of my sight. Downs was taken into a doctor's shop.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Did the man usually stand out in the road - A. Yes. JOHN HOLLEY . I am a Hackney coachman. I saw the prisoner go up the road, and afterwards return up Oxford-street towards St. Giles's, driving as fast as the horse could gallop; it was about one o'clock. He was continually whipping his horse under the belly. I was on my box, and hollowed out,""For God's don't go so fast, you will do mischief."" Mine was the first coach on the stand. Downs was crossing from the middle to the side to get out of the way. Several people hollowed to him, but he took no notice. The cart came so quick on Downs that he turned himself sideways, and the shaft and the horse's shoulder caught him, and struck him about the head and shoulder, shoved him forward about a yard and a half, and then the off wheel went over him - the prisoner continued whipping his horses more and more to get out of the way; he was followed but got out of my sight.Cross-examined. Q. Did his wheels make a great noise - A. They made a rattling. It was not a covered cart. WILLIAM THURSTON . I am a coachman. I was in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner in a cart galloping; I never heard him call to the man to get out of the way - the horse knocked him down, and cut his head open. I saw him whip his horse twice after he went over the deceased. He certainly must have seen and known that he had ran over him. I took him to a chymist's shop, then to a surgeon's, and then to the Middlesex Hospital.Cross-examined. Q. How far off were you when you first saw him A. Not six yards; I was on the north side, and the deceased was on my side, between two and three yards off the curb. ROBERT PILWORTH . I am a carpenter. I was coming up Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner in Princes-street, a number of people were round the cart; a man was holding the reins, and the prisoner flogging the horse to get away. I seized both reins and stopped him - he was very violent. The horse appeared in a very bad state; he was as wet as if he had been drawn through a pond.Cross-examined. Q. Was he sober - A. He was tipsy certainly, and was remanded to get sober. JOHN SWEETMAN . I am a surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital. The deceased was brought there about half-past one o'clock; he had his right thigh broken, and a severe blow on the head.

I followed him to light him out, but he turned back at the bottom of the stairs, and pulling a piece of cord out, said he would take the dimensions of the pipes, and give the gentleman an answer when he called; I let him go into the kitchen alone. Franklin called to me in about five minutes, to know if I had let the man out; I said No. I went down to the kitchen andfound he had pulled the leaden pipe out of the sink, and laid it on the window, and had a small piece of it in his hand; he said""This is what I want, for I must have something to make the tin pipe the same size, and must take it and the brass top to fit it."" He went away with the pipe. He had pulled it away from the sink. I thought it not right to let him go without orders, and I asked him who authorized him to come and take it away. He said""The gentleman who has taken the house."" I said""No gentleman has taken the house."" He said""If you don't want me to have it, here it is for you."" I said""I think we will have you along with it,"" and seized him. He threw himself on his knees, and begged for mercy, and said he was distressed, and had not eaten for two or three days.

GEORGE MYERS . I live in London Terrace, Commercial-road. The prisoner is my uncle; we were formerly partners in selling pens and quills - the partnership ceased three years ago. I had a dispute about his wife's business some time ago, before the Magistrate, but none with him. She, him, my wife, and I, were at Lambeth-street Office together in March; his wife made a charge against mine, which was dismissed. On the following afternoon, about five o'clock, I was in my kitchen, the prisoner knocked eight or nine times; I knew his voice; he called me a b **** and a thief, and threatened me with my life to come up; I went up and opened the door - my child was not with me. I opened the door and as I trod off the wooden step on the stone step of the door, I received a stab on my right side, and as I came off the step I received another in my hand. I had said nothing at all to him; I saw nothing in his hand at any time. After he had stabbed me, my wife picked up the knife - I never saw it in his hand - I struck him with a broom stick which I had in my hand before he stabbed me - it was by the threshold of my door where he stabbed me. I struck him with the broom stick on the head; I was on the ground. I was pulled down, I cannot say by whom, there was so many there - the people came up seeing the scuffle. I do not know how I came on the ground. I went to my father and shewed him how I was stabbed, and then returned home.Q. How did you get away from where you lay down - A. Three or four people lifted me up, I do not know them. I believe the prisoner ran away. I did not strike him before he stabbed me.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. After you struck him did you not both pull off your clothes, and fight for a quarter of an hour - A. No, we did not fight at all, that I swear. We live next door but one to each other.Q. On your oath did not you give your wife the knife - A. She picked it off the ground. I never said I would hang my uncle.COURT. Q. Have you never said that when your uncle struck you and you were going to strike him, that you saw a knife under his coat sleeve - A. I do not know that I ever did. I believe he kicked me when I was on the ground, but I was insensible. I said that a young man who is gone to Brighton parted us.Q. Why not call out that you were stabbed immediately - A. I was afraid, because my wife was in the family way. SARAH WOLLAND . I was standing at my door on the 6th of March, (I live next door to Myers the prosecutor), I saw the prisoner come up; Myers's door was shut; I heard the prisoner call him a b - y b - r, and knocked at the door repeatedly. I saw him put his left hand into his left coat pocket, and making use of very bad expressions all the time - he took out a knife, opened it with his right hand, and put it up his left sleeve - he said he would have his b - y life. The knife fell from his sleeve, he picked it up and replaced it; George Myers came up in ten or fifteen minutes, and opened the door; the moment he got off the wooden step on the pavement, he pulled his knife from his sleeve and stabbed him; I saw this quite plain. His knocking at the door had brought a great number of people about the door. It is a private house. I am inclined to think he was in liquor, but not so far gone as not to know what he was doing.Cross-examined. Q. Is not your name Cook - A. I have gone by that name; it is my mother's maiden name. I have not seen my husband for twelve months. I get my living as I can. I let a room to three females.Q. Did the uncle and nephew fight long - A. I did not stay to see, for when the blood came from his hand I went in doors. I went out again in a quarter of an hour and saw him come out in his shirt and say,""Look here how I am stabbed.""Q. Do you let out a room for unlawful purposes to men and woman - A. I let the room to the women, they do as they please. I saw no broom stick in the prosecutor's hand - a little boy picked up the knife, and gave it to his wife, as she says, but I did not see it. I did not see the prosecutor strike him. GEORGE MYERS re-examined. I went to my father's house, and shewed him how I was stabbed. I produce the shirt and waistcoat which I wore; they are cut, and the shirt is bloody.Cross-examined. Q. Did you shew your father the shirt - A. Yes. He did not say that my shirt was not cut. I had leeches put to my side; I wore this shirt then. I went to my father before I went home; my wife had not given me the knife then. WILLIAM FREEMAN . I am an officer. On the 6th of March, in consequence of information, I was within two hundred yards of this place, and met the prisoner, and took him. WILLIAM FOSTER . I produce the knife which I tookout of the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket - there was wet blood marks on it. He was in bed. GEORGE THOMAS DALE . I am dresser to the London Hospital; I was called in to see the prosecutor a quarter of an hour after, he had received a wound in his right breast; I probed it, it was about three inches deep, and in a slanting direction; I should suppose it was given by such an instrument as the knife produced, it was a serious wound, I ordered leeches to it, the shirt was bloody before they were ordered.Cross-examined. Q. It was not very deep. - A. It had struck against one of the breast bones and glanced off; if it had not been for the bone it would have penetrated the lungs; the cut in the waistcoat corresponds with the place the wound is in.Prisoner's Defence. - I have witnesses to call. JOHN M'KENZIE . I am a porter; I was on London Terrace, Commercial Road; I saw this man rather in a rage talking about somebody, and all of a sudden a door opened, the prosecutor came out with a broom stick in his hand, and struck the prisoner as hard as he could; the prisoner did nothing to him before the man struck him; he was without his coat and his shirt sleeves turned up; then the prisoner pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and a scuffle ensued for three or four minutes, or rather better, the prosecutor got him against a back wall and pummel led him well, so that he could not see out of his eye, and his face was all over a gore of blood; the prosecutor went in doors and I left. I saw the prosecutor go into his house; they were both quarrelling and fighting.COURT. Q. You are quite sure the prisoner's face was all in a gore of blood - A. Quite, and his eye was quite swollen, he had scratches and pinches on his face; they were quite plain, so that every body might see them. PHILIP HALL . I was going along the Terrace, a row commenced between the prisoner and prosecutor, I stopped a little, and the prosecutor came out with a stick and hit him as hard as he could, and knocked him against the rails; then the prisoner pulled his coat off, and they got fighting for ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, and after that the prisoner was taken to his own door by some women; I am sure the prosecutor hit him first.COURT. Q. Then the prisoner never struck at all - A. Yes, they got fighting, he had two black eyes, and was all over blood; the prosecutor went in doors as well. MARY BROWN . I was in London Terrace, and saw the prisoner very shockingly, and dreadfully ill-used; his nephew took hold of the broom stick and knocked it about his head as hard as he could, and then hit him against the wall with his fist, against the brick wall, and wrung his nose; after this the prosecutor's wife came out and tore the prisoner's shirt right down, and said,""Take him and kill him at once;"" the prisoner went in doors bleeding; his face was covered with blood, and he had a shocking black eye. MICHAEL MYERS . I am the prosecutor's brother; I was at my door, which is two doors from my brother's; my uncle came down the Terrace rather in liquor, and instead of knocking at his own door he knocked at my brother's with his fist, not with the knocker; my brother came out with a broom stick and knocked him right against the pailing; that is the first thing which was done; he then threw the broom stick down, and fought with him; my brother was taken into his house, and my uncle taken into our house. I parted them; my uncle was much knocked about on the temple; my brother came to my father's door about a quarter of an hour after the row was over, and said,""Father, see I am stabbed."" I never saw any knife, except in my brother's wife's hands, which was after the row was over.COURT. Q. Your uncle used no bad language - A. None at all, he was not in the least passion, his face and temples were scratched and bleeding. ABRAHAM MYERS . I am the prisoner's brother. I was at home - my sister-in-law was in the kitchen. I heard my brother's voice; I called her up to the door; he was speaking loud; I went up and saw my son George open his street door, he lives two doors from me; he opened his door with a broom stick in hand and struck his uncle over his head; he staggered, then he threw the stick down and struck him with his fist till he fell; then my brother pulled his coat off - my son had none on, and they fought for a quarter of an hour. When my son came out he struck him instantly with the stick, and the blood gushed out of his temples. After fighting my brother was taken into his own house and then into mine; he was very bloody. In about a quarter of an hour my son came to my door, and said, he was stabbed; this was the first I heard of it. I said,""Why not say you was stabbed before you fought;"" he opened his breast and shewed it me, and I did not see a drop of blood, it looked like a wound. My son has said, he would go twenty miles to hang his uncle at any time; and my son hung himself once, about twelve years ago.COURT. Q. Do you mean to say that when he presented his side to you, there was no appearance of a wound or blood - A. None; I saw a wound but no blood. I cannot tell whether it appeared a fresh wound, there was blood on his shirt, on his back and trowsers; I saw none on the side of his shirt, nor on his breast. I saw no knife. PHOEBE MYERS . I am the prosecutor's sister. I came down the terrace, and saw the prisoner come along; he knocked at my nephew's door by mistake as it appeared; then he looked and went to his own door momentarily, and before he could get rightly to it, George came out with a stick, and gave him a blow at the side of his neck.COURT. Q. Not on the head - A. No. He kept himself up as well as he could, but a hard blow came the second time, and he fell; he got up, pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and they fought away ten or fifteen minutes. I was close to them, and saw no knife; after fighting, the prisoner fell, and George fell on him; somebody took them up. George Myers 's wife came out; I went into the house with her, and he followed. His wife fainted, and he sat on the bed by her, and while I was getting her out of the faint, he got off the chair by the bed side, and said""Aunt, I am stabbed."" He went to his father's in ten minutes. I saw no knife produced.COURT. Q. What led you into the street - A. I was going to my brother-in-law's.Q. You were not in your brother-in-law's kitchen - A. No. I am Abraham Myers 's sister-in-law. I live in Bulmer street, Commercial Road. I had not gone into Abraham's house when it happened. I did not hear the prisoner callout at all. I saw him give a single knock at the door with the knocker. I called my brother Abraham out after he was knocked down by the second blow; George Myers always said the prisoner was never a good friend of his, and if he could do him any animosity he would.JOHN M'KENZIE re-examined. When we went before the magistrate, I went into an ale-house in Church-lane. The prosecutor said to the prisoner,""I shall hang you yet."" When I saw the prisoner, he was going along the terrace in a rage and passion. WILLIAM FREEMAN re-examined. When I met the prisoner, he had apparently received a blow, his cheek-bone was a little swollen, and his frill was torn; he was neither scratched nor bleeding. I took him a quarter of an hour after it happened. WILLIAM DALE . I saw the prosecutor at five o'clock, his wound was a fresh one.

ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution. ELEANOR REVETT . I am the wife of John Revett ; we live at No. 13, Deer's-place, Somers Town, in the parish of St. Pancras; he rents the house; the prisoner was employed by us, but not as a regular servant; she had been about three months with us; the fire happened on Sunday. On the day before I received a letter from Mr. Abbott, I opened it in the prisoner's presence, it contained a 20 l. note; she was sitting by my side at needle-work; the note fell down by the side of the fire, and she picked it up; and gave it me; I said""Mary there is a 20 l. note, pick it up;"" this was about half-past twelve; I gave the note to Mr. Revett, when he came home after candle-light, I gave it him in the letter; he went out to get it changed but could not; he then put it in the cash-box, and locked it; he took the box up stairs, when we went to bed, and put it on the drawers in our bedroom. On Sunday about half-past one, I went to the cash-box; my husband was not at home; I had taken the key out of his pocket in the morning, and placed it in the looking-glass drawer which was locked; this was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; I opened it about half-past one, and took out 6 s. in silver; I did not then see the 20 l. note; I did not look for it; I only went to the silver drawer; I immediately locked the cash-box, and placed it between the bed and the mattress; I am confident that I locked the box; I carried it by the handle, and if it had not been locked it would have opened in my hand; I was very particular in locking it; I left home a few minutes after this, and went to where my husband was; I came home with him in a coach about nine o'clock; we were not sent for; I found several people round the fore garden gate, and there was an alarm of fire; I found several people up stairs; but my conversation was directed to the prisoner, whom I found sitting in the parlour, by the door; Mr. Balls was up stairs; I asked the prisoner how the fire came, she said, she did not know; I repeatedly asked her, and received the same answer; she did not move from her seat, but appeared quite unconcerned; Mr. Revett went up stairs; I saw the bed-room before he came down, and I saw the bed-hangings were burnt, and the bed was on fire then; I had given the prisoner leave to go to chapel that evening; I went to Mrs. Ball's house, which is five minutes walk, and returned shortly; Mr. Revett then produced the cash-box, and the 20 l. note was missing, he said,""Mary, you know something of this,"" she denied it; he said,""There should be a 20 l. note in this cash-box,"" I had replaced the key in the dressing-glass drawer, it was not produced at this time; Mr. Revett said, it would be better to have every person in the place searched before they left, which was done by the parish constable; the prisoner was still sitting in the same place all the time; till the officer desired her to go into the other room to be searched. The note was not found, she fainted away, and was afterwards searched; the outside of the box was burnt, a sovereign which I had left in it, and some silver was still there; the prisoner had frequently seen me take money out of the box - I am sure I did not leave it in the state it was found. JOHN REVETT . I came home with Mrs. Revett; I had put the 20 l. note in this cash-box, (producing it) under this bill of exchange, and placed the inner box, containing the silver and gold over it; when I came home at night I went up stairs, and perceived, on approaching the bedroom, that the curtains were on fire and nearly consumed, and immediately on my reaching the top of the stairs, Balls handed the cash-box to me; the bolt of the lock was shot, but the asp was not in it; the bed was partly burnt; the straw pallias appeared to have been set fire to in four places; the bed furniture was entirely consumed; the posts of the bedstead were partly burnt; but the sacking particularly, over a place where it appeared to me a fire had been kindled on the floor; a place in the floor and wainscoat were burnt; also the paper of the room, and the bed-board; that was all the damage. When I missed the 20 l. note I saw the prisoner sitting in the parlour, I said,""Mary, you know something of this,"" she said,""Indeed, Sir, I do not;"" I then ordered a general search; I directed Williams to go to Ball, and search his lodging, as he had been at my house; he is a relation by marriage; I went with him; the note has not been found. When the prisoner was going to be searched she appeared agitated and fainted - immediately after the search she was taken to the watch-house.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you got the pieces of the floor here - A. Yes; the wainscoat and paper were also burnt; it appeared that the object was to conceal the note being stolen - John Brooks is my landlord.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were there any ashes under the bill of exchange - A. No. Sarah Brown our constant servant, came home in the coach with us. ELEANOR BALLS . I went to Mr. Revett's house on this day; I got there at half-past four o'clock, before my husband; I found the prisoner alone; I went to enquire if her mistress was out, (I am Mr. Revett's aunt) and if she wished to go to chapel I was to keep house for her; she said, her mistress had given her leave to go out; Mr. Revett had asked us to come in the evening, and let hergo to chapel; I returned home to tea, and came back to the house a little before six; the right hand parlour shutters were shut up, and one of the kitchens; she went to chapel as she said, and returned at a quarter-past eight o'clock. I was in the house the whole time, and in the left hand parlour the principal part of the time. When I first entered the house after she was gone I searched every room, it was about six o'clock, being alone I thought it proper; I saw nothing in disorder at all; I searched the bed-room, and looked under the bedstead, there was no sign of fire or any thing to occasion it; the bed curtains were neatly folded and laid upon the pillow; the bed was not turned down; I had no candle, it was not dark enough; when I came down, as the kitchen was shut up, and the cellar dark, I lighted a candle which was left on a table in the parlour, I lighted it at the parlour fire; I looked round in the cellar, kitchen, and closet, under the stairs, then returned to the parlour and put the candle out; I did not go into the bed-room with the candle; I saw nothing of the cash-box; there was no fire in the bed-room grate, nor in any room but one parlour and one kitchen; the prisoner returned at a quarter-past eight o'clock, I had lighted the candle then, and she took it from the parlour to go into the kitchen to light her kitchen candle, and pull off her things; she came up with my candle, I asked her if she had been to chapel, and if she was in time; she said Yes; I asked who preached, and what was the text; she said, she did not recollect it; Mr. Balls came at half-past eight, and sat with me; I then told the prisoner we would take some bread and cheese and porter for supper, and return, observing that I supposed Mr. Revett would not be offended; she said,""Oh, no!"" and brought up the tray, and fetched some porter. We then thought it would be best for one of us to stop till Mr. Revett came home, and I left Mr. Balls there.Cross-examined. Q. She did not hurry you out of the house - A. No. AMBROSE BALLS . I came in and had bread and cheese; my wife went home; the prisoner came into the parlour, took a candle and went out of the parlour, and shut the door, she staid out nearly ten minutes, and came again into the parlour, and set the candle on the side board; I do not know whether it was lighted; when she came in she sat down on a chair by the door; I never knew her do so before; I had not asked her to sit down; I said,""Mary, you had better come nearer the fire,"" and moved to let her; we talked for ten or fifteen minutes about Eagle-street chapel; I then smelt fire, and said,""Molly, I smell fire;"" she said,""I have a time or two.""Q. Once or twice you mean - A. Yes, I took the candle off the table and went up stairs; the smell increased, and when I got to the chamber-door, I saw the smoke coming from between the door and door post. I called out and said,""Mary, the bed is on fire,"" she was still sitting in the parlour. I came down to her, went to the front door and gave the alarm of fire; she still sat there and did not stir to give any alarm; she was crying and did not speak to me. I went over the way to Messrs. Brooks to give the alarm, and returned immediately; I took a candle and went down to get water; the fire was extinguished; Mr. Brooks, Ellen and Williams came into the house and assisted. The prisoner remained sitting in the parlour till Mr. Revett came home; Williams found the cash box and handed it to me; I gave it Mr. Revett in the same state as I received it, it was very hot; I went down with him; his account is true.Cross-examined. Q. When you came down, having discovered the fire, you at once went to the door and gave an alarm - A. I did, I was gone a very short time leaving her alone in the house; she could have escaped if she choose, or while I was up stairs. She fainted when the constable ordered her into another room to be searched; it was not proposed for a woman to search her - the road is open to the house in front; there is a brick wall behind, seven feet high, a back door leads to the garden.COURT. Q. After your wife left did any body come in - A. Nobody. I should think the place could not have been set fire to a quarter of an hour before I discovered it. I cannot say whether the bed was turned down or not, the back door was bolted; I saw the watchman open it to get at the water-butt.MRS. BALLS. I was alone in the house about two hours.Q. Suppose that after you examined the room, if any body had set fire to the bed directly after, must you not have discovered it - A. Yes. The back door leading to the garden was bolted and barred, and the shutters also. JOHN REVETT re-examined. After I got home the back door was open for the people to get to the water-butt. My house was not insured. I went to chapel in the Borough-road, and attended three services without coming home. My wife joined me in the afternoon. SARAH BROWN . I am Mr. Revett's servant. On the Saturday I had bought nine bundles of fire wood - I used a bundle and a half on Sunday morning, and left half a bundle in the dresser drawer, and put seven in the cupboard under the stairs, the prisoner was in the kitchen and knew this. After the alarm, next morning, I looked in the closet and found only three bundles; but next morning I found two more in a foul clothes basket, which stood in the same closet - I might have put them there myself; only two bundles were then missing. I know that the prisoner had a cambric muslin slip, which is a sort of petticoat with a body and short sleeves - I saw it on the floor of the bed-room, were we both slept, on Sunday morning; she had worn it on the Saturday - it was old but serviceable. On the Monday I saw part of it between the bed and mattress in our bed-room, and the other part I did not find. When I came home with my master and mistress, the prisoner was in the parlour; I asked her where the fire was, she said she did not know - I asked her three times, she said she did not know whether there had been any fire in the house or not. I asked why she did not get a light for the men who were going down stairs getting the water; she said nothing. After she was searched I asked her if she went any where besides to chapel; she said not in the evening, but she went in the morning to No. 11, Saffron-hill; I asked her again in the morning about the text, she said she could not remember the chapter or verse, but the words were,""Seek and ye shall find, knock, and the door of mercy shall be opened."" THOMAS WILLIAMS . I am a constable. I was passing, went into the house, and extinguished the fire. The bedthings were taken off, and under the wool mattrass I saw the tin cash-box; it was open ajar and very hot, I could scarcely hold it. I called for the master of the house; Mr. Balls represented himself as such, and I gave it him in the same state.Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge. GUILTY - DEATH .

Stating them to be the property of Joseph Richardson .MR. ANDREWS conducted the prosecution. JOSEPH RICHARDSON . I am a woollen draper, and live on Ludgate-street. George Biggs was my servant for four years, up to the time of this offence. On the 5th of March, I sent him to Mr. Sterry's for 645 l. He was to take up a bill with it at Holts, in Broad-street. It was a bill I had accepted for Mr. Sterry, for goods sold me by him, and I was not provided to take it up. I sent the prisoner to Mr. Sterry a little before three o'clock; he had been informed in the morning, that he would have to go. I was sent for to Mr. Sterry's a little after four, and found the prisoner George Biggs there crying, and holding a handkerchief up to his mouth, Mr. Elton, the clerk, told me in his presence, that he, (George), had been to take up the bill, and had been knocked down and robbed of the money. I said I could not believe any thing of the kind, and said""What have you done with the other money;"" meaning 15 l. I had given him to take up another bill. He said that was in his waistcoat pocket safe, and gave it me. He persisted in his account. He said he was robbed in Austin Friar's. I cannot say whether that would be in his way. I knew he had a brother, but did not know his person. WILLIAM ELTON . I am clerk to Mr. Sterry, of Basinghall-street. On the 5th of March, about a quarter to four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, George Biggs , came to our warehouse. I saw the notes delivered to him, there was a 300 l. dated the 18th of February, No. 9319 - one 200 l. dated the 16th of February, No. 3876 - one 100 l. dated the 19th of February, No. 13817 - two of 20 l. each dated 5th of February, Nos. 17205 and 17593 - one 5 l. dated the 31st January, No. 16544 - all dated 1822. I saw them delivered into his hands to pay a bill, which Mr. Richardson could not pay. George Biggs delivered that message to us, and said he was going to Broad-street to pay it, (Looks at the 100 l. a 20 l. and a 5 l. note) these were among the notes delivered to him. He went away, and in twenty minutes returned crying, and said he had been knocked down in Austin Friars, by three people and robbed of the money, that he had taken it out of his pocket, with the notice to see where he was to go to; that as they met him, one of them struck him in the eye, mouth, and stomach, and knocked him down, and took the money from him; that they lifted him up, and put him on a step of a door, and left him. I sent for Mr. Richardson, and kept him there till he came, he gave the same account again. Austin Friars is not in the direct way to Broad-street; he should have gone down London Wall, Winchester-street, it could not make a minutes difference.Prisoner GEORGE BIGGS . Q. How long was I at Mr. Sterry's - A. About fifteen minutes.Prisoner RICHARD BIGGS . Q. Did you ever see me in company with my brother - A. Never that I know. ESTHER WESTON . My husband is a hair-dresser, we live in Holyday-yard, Creed Lane. I know the prisoner George, and now know Richard. On Tuesday, the 5th of March, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw them together in St. Martin's Court, Ludgate Hill. A girl of the town, (in appearance), was with them; they seemed in deep conversation together. I have since learnt they are brothers. I am quite sure of their persons, and that it was between three and four o'clock. JOHN HOPPER . I am a waterman at St. Catherine's. I know Richard Biggs , but not George. I saw Richard in St. Catherine's-lane on the 5th of March. I drank with him at the Black Boy, public-house there, at seven o'clock in the evening, he shewed me a 5 l. Bank note, and wanted me to get change. I went to Mr. Austin's, the Ship; Mrs. Austin gave me change for it. I gave her the same note I received from him. He said nothing about how he got it. I am quite sure of his person.RICHARD BIGGS. Q. Are you sure whether it was Tuesday or Wednesday - A. No, it was one of those days. Q. Did you not go to my father's last week. - A. Yes, I was informed his father was dying and wanted to see me. I did not ask him to be answerable for any money if I staid away. JOHN AUSTIN . I keep the Ship. My wife gave me the note changed for Hopper, and I marked the name of Hopper on the note. I don't know what day it was.Prisoner RICHARD BIGGS . Q. How long was it in your possession before you marked it - A. I think three days, but I had no other note in the house of any kind. RUTH AUSTIN , (looks at the 5 l. note). I know this to be the note I changed for Hopper on Tuesday, the 5th March. I knew him before; I put the note in a bag, there was no other there; I gave it to Mr. Austin about nine in the evening, when he came home. It was in nobody's hands in the mean time. JAMES HAYES . I had seen Richard Biggs twice before the Wednesday; I knew him by the name of John Brown; he lodged at No. 4, Joiner-street, Toolley-street, Borough, with Jane Somerfield , who is a loose girl. On Sunday morning, the 6th of March, I was passing through Joiner-street to work, and Jane and her sister called me up. Richard was not there; I did not see him that day - I saw him on Thursday morning at his lodgings. I whistled as I went by, and was let in by Jane's sister. I went up and saw the prisoner and Jane in the bed. Richard asked if I would have any thing to drink; he sent Harriet for gin and peppermint, and after it was drank Richard gave the bolster to Harriet, and asked her to give me the notes out of it. She was a long time getting them out. She emptied all the feathers out, and at last found them. He looked at them, and said""It is all right; give me the bolster - put the feathers in, and I will put them where I can place my hand on them."" He put them in again, and she sewed the bolster up; and after breakfast, at eleven o'clock, Richard, I, and Mason, went out togetherto go to Covent Garden. Richard gave Mason some sovereigns. I told him to walk on one side of the way, and we two would walk on the other, to avoid suspicion. We went to Govent Garden; and just as we got near the market, he met a young man named Bill Watts . We went into the wine vaults to have something to drink, and after drinking the liquor, Richard gave Watts something to drink.Q. Did he at last give you any money? - A. On the Saturday morning I went up stairs - he gave me what he said was 500 l., and twenty sovereigns, to take care of for him, I said I would. It was in two bank notes, one was a 200 l. I saw him again on Sunday; and he told me that his brother went to borrow some money for his master to take up a bill; and when he had got the money he gave it to him, and said he had been knocked down and robbed of it. When Richard gave me the money, he said,""They cannot hurt you, and besides you can get a good character, for you are at work.""COURT. Q. You seem about as bad as him, if this is true - A. It is all true. I live at No. 9, Union-row, Snow's Fields, Bermondsey, and am a colourer.Prisoner RICHARD BIGGS . Q. Did I know where you lived at the time I gave you the money - A. No, he sent Jane with me to see that I took it home. She only went as far as Western-street; but no further, as she met a young man.Q. What became of the money - A. I did not come home on Thursday, but on Friday morning, my parents did not know I had it; and I concealed it in the ceiling of the privy, and three men came and took it away. I only know this by what my sister told me.Q. Do you mean to swear you do not know what became of it - A. I do not. I opened it, but did not see what the other note was.Q. Were you in the habit of seeing me after you had the money - A. Yes, on Monday, at the Feathers, Waterloo Road. I never told him I lost it. It was not taken till the Friday following. He told me to take a pound or two when I wanted it, but not to take the notes. He put some rag over the notes, and then wrapped the sovereigns up in it. HENRY TURNPENNY . On the 5th of March I was sent for - I and Mr. Richardson, the prisoner George, and Mr. Sterry went to Austin Friars, where he said he was robbed; he pointed out the spot where he was robbed; we could find nobody there that knew any thing of it. He said it happened about four o'clock. Next day I went after Richard, and found him at last, at Ingram's, the Sun, in Bedfordbury. I had very hard work to get him away. I was surrounded immediately I seized him, and unless I I had produced my fire arms, I should not have secured him. He made very great resistance. I was forced out of the skittle-ground into the tap-room. I found 24 s. 6 d. on him. JOHN SMITH . I am a dealer in coins, and live in Cornhill. On the 6th April I took the 100 l. bank note, numbered 13,817, produced. It was paid me by an elderly man, who brought one hundred and twenty Napoleons for it. I sent it to the Bank, and then it was stopped. ALICE EWBANKS . I live in Austin Friars, about five yards from the spot where the robbery was said to have been committed. I heard of no robbery on that day, until the gentleman came at night to enquire. I was in doors at four o'clock, cleaning the kitchen, with the kitchen windows open, and must have heard if there had been any alarm. I was there from two till five. I am house-keeper to a Mr. Robinson.MR. ELTON. (Looking at the 100 l. and 5 l. notes) These are two of the notes paid him. GEORGE BIGGS 'S, Defence. I have nothing to state only the manner I was robbed of the money. When the bill was presented to Mr. Richardson, I was not aware I was going to take it up. The direction was left, and about eleven or twelve o'clock, I took it to Mr. Sterry's, and told him the bill was due. He called afterwards, and said,""Send somebody between three and four o'clock for the money."" I was not aware I was going to take it up, till I was sent. Mr. Richardson sometimes took them up himself. I left Mr. Richardson's at half-past three in the afternoon; previous to that, about ten minutes before, I had to go to Thomas-street. I had met my brother in the morning, and went with him to have something to drink, at the Cock. He had a young woman with him, and said he was going to the Cock. The last time I saw him, was twenty minutes after three, and then I did not know I was going to take up the bill. When I returned, I was ordered to go to Mr. Sterry's I stopped there ten minutes before I received the money, which was given me from a parcel of notes. I went out of Mr. Sterry's front door, and along London Wall, up Winchester-street, to Austin Friars, and in the notes I had the direction of the bill. Not being sure of the number, I unfortunately pulled the notes out of my pocket, and looked at the direction; at the moment three very genteel persons passed me, and the moment I put the money in my pocket. I received a blow on the back of my neck; at the same moment one in my mouth, and one on the chest which knocked me down, and completely deprived me of speech; two of the persons lifted me up by the arms, and placed me on the step, and run towards Broad-street; the contrary way to that they were going when they met me. I was not able to call after them through the blow, but run as well as I was able, the way they went; but never saw them after they crossed the corner of Austin Friars. I run as fast as I could up Threadneedle-street, but could not see them; I returned the same way as I came to Mr. Sterry's, and several people asked me what was the matter. I said I had been robbed. I make no doubt but they would have gone with me if I had asked them. I then thought it most advisable to make the best of my way back to Mr. Sterry's, and endeavour, if possible, to stop the number of the notes. I stated to them the manner in which I had lost it, they asked me if I should know the persons again, if I saw them. I said I was certain I should know two of them; Mr. Sterry said I must come to the Mansion House. I went before the Lord Mayor, and stated the manner I had lost the money. Mr. Richardson and Mr. Sterry were sometime together with the Lord Mayor. We then went back to Mr. Sterry's, and staid there till near eleven o'clock; they then said they did not believe what I had said. Mr. Richardson, I believe, objected to my being taken into custody that night, and I was taken to his house, where I remained all night, and next morning proceeded to business as usual, and opened the shop, swept the door, and brushed the windows, andabout nine o'clock Mr. Richardson went out, and did not return till about eleven. He had told me previous to going out that I must go before the Lord Mayor, and undergo an examination. I said I was willing, and about eleven o'clock I went. I was not in custody, I had abundant opportunity to escape, if I had been guilty, but I knew I was innocent. RICHARD BIGGS 'S Defence. I recollect being in company with my brother on the day in question, as I was in the habit of seeing him three or four times a week; the first time I met him was about half-past twelve o'clock, on Ludgate-hill, I was in company with a young woman, he said he was going to Holborn; I said, I was going to have something to drink at the Cock, and would wait there for him; he came there and went home; I waited there after he had left me, till about a quarter past three, and just as I was coming away he came there a second time. I asked him to sit down, and if he could stop; he said he was going to Thames-street and could not wait. We all came out together from the Cock, and stood a few minutes talking at the door; I went towards Temple-bar with the woman. I wish to make a few observations as to Hayes. He acknowledges I did not know where he lived; I leave it to you to consider whether it is likely that I should leave so much money in care of a person to whom I was a stranger. If I had counsel it would be plainer to your Lordship. On the first examination he swore it was a 300 l. and 200 l. - On the second, he said it was a 200 l. note, and the other might be a song for what he knew. He mentions likewise in his statement a third person named Harriet, who, if she was brought forward, could perhaps greatly corroborate his testimony. These witnesses, I submit, are kept away, because if they were questioned as to Hayes's character (for I know for many years it has been no good) he has been an utterer of forged notes. As to Hopper, the first I knew of him was his being procured as an hired bail for me at Lambeth-street, for which he received 10 s.; he went to my father and offered not to come against me for 20 l., and he sent into the gaol to say if I sent him out 2 l. he would not appear. HENRY TURNPENNY . Harriet Somerville is in Brixton gaol I understand. I went to enquire for her to bring her as a witness here. WILLIAM MASON . I live in Green Church-yard, St. Catherine,'s, and am apprenticed to a waterman; the prisoner's father lives in Little Macclesfield-street; I was there one night when Hopper came and offered to go out of the way for the sum of 20 l. His father said it was not in his power to give it him.Q. Were you not taken up on this charge - A. Yes, but I knew nothing of it. I rowed them up to Waterloo-bridge, and he paid me the fare, the same as any other person. I don't know Bill Watts . I have seen Harriet and Jane, but don't know where they are.MR. ELTON re-examined. When the prisoner came back and gave this account his lips were swollen, and he had blood on his handkerchief. GEORGE BIGGS - GUILTY Aged 18. RICHARD BIGGS - GUILTY.

I was a prisoner in Newgate on the 30th of March, and Francis Dempsey and M'Carthy were prisoners there. We were all in the same yard; I saw Dempsey throwing some sopped bread at the prisoner out of the yard, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, just after breakfast; the bread hit him on the shoulder; the prisoner took no notice of it, but went down stairs; Dempsey followed him, threw more pieces of bread at him, which hit him on the back. As he was going down stairs the prisoner said, if he did not be easy he would hit him on the top knot; then the prisoner went up stairs again and the deceased threw more bread at him; then the prisoner kicked at him, but missed him; they then both got together and struggled, and both fell; he did not strike him, but threw him in the struggle; the prisoner was uppermost, they got up again - had another scuffle - I saw no blows, the deceased fell again, and the prisoner at the top. Dempsey seemed hurt and said, he would not fight any more, and leant his head on the table. He died in the afternoon. He laid hold of the prisoner's foot and began the wrestling. EDWARD MARTIN . I was a prisoner in Newgate; the first I saw was M'Carthy entering the ward; the deceased threw a bit of sopped bread at him, only once that I saw; I did not see them till the second fall; the deceased was hurt; there were no blows, only wrestling. EDWARD MURPHY . I was a prisoner in the same ward, and saw the deceased following the prisoner, throwing a piece of sopped bread at him, the prisoner said he would give him a kick on the top knot, the deceased still provoked him, they wrestled and fell, the prisoner was taken from him, and wrestled again, and had another fall, the deceased was undermost - a little while after he laid on the table and seemed very bad. WILLIAM BOX , ESQ. I am surgeon of Newgate; I saw Dempsey between twelve and one o'clock, he was then dying very fast, and died in three minutes; I opened his body, the internal appearances were perfectly healthy, and completely free from the appearance of violence, there was no appearance of scratch or bruise; I examined his head particularly, there was a rupture of one of the principle arteries, and six ounces of blood were taken out, that caused his death - it is impossible to say it was in consequence of the fall.

BOLLAND and WALFORD conducted the prosecution. WILLIAM FINCH . I am a tide-waiter at the Customs, and had charge of the lug boat Frederick, on the 4th of March, in the basin of the West India Dock, eleven puncheons of rum were in it; Salter was an Excise waterman, and had charge of the Joseph, which laid about twenty yards from the Frederick; Jennings had charge of the Maunder, about thirty feet off, they could easily get from these boats to the Frederick; I was on guard near the Frederick, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I went on board her, and got under the tarpauling for my great coat, and smelt a strong smell of rum, as I got into the lug boat, I spoke to Salter, who was on board a lug boat next to the Frederick, I found the tarpauling had been removed, I lifted it up and found a syphon put into the rum cask, with a long bladder to it, it was nearly full, I took the syphon off the skin, and called two officers to help me to get it out. Salter walked across to the Maunder as soon as he saw me going aft; Jennings was walking on the Maunder, Salter said something to him, and when I called the officers to my assistance, they both went into the Maunder's cabin, I saw them both come out together and lean over, and one of them threw something over into the water, it floated, and then something was thrown in which sunk; I said to Salter you have made a pretty thing of it; he said, I had a d - d sight to say about it; nobody was near the Maunder but Salter, he was within eight feet of it; Culverhouse picked up the thing which floated, it was two large bladders; we took them into custody; Roebuck searched the Maunder and found a bladder smaller than the one which was full of rum.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You never saw Jennings out of his boat - A.

How many vessels were there in the bason - A. I do not know, the Joseph laid a-head of the Maunder - I was walking on the quay to keep myself warm.Q. Are not these men in the habit of passing from one vessel to the other to keep themselves warm - A. They walk on their own vessels, but not from one to another; I have seen them do it - I had been walking about for a quarter of an hour on the quay. EDWARD CULVERHOUSE . I am an Excise tide-water; I had the care of the Frederick from eight o'clock in the morning till six; she was Thomas Edward 's boat, and had eleven puncheons of rum on board; I joined Finch to walk on the quay between seven and eight o'clock, and in five minutes Finch called me, I saw Salter in the lug boat adjoining the Frederick; I stepped into the boat and found a syphon in one of the puncheons; Finch had the bladder in his hand; Salter went over into the Maunder, Finch followed him. I afterwards went into the Maunder, Roebuck came out of the cabin with the skin in his hand, I pulled two bladders out of the water just a-stern of the Maunder. I heard Finch say to Salter that he had made a pretty thing of it; he said he had a d - d sight to say about it. I found the tarpauling lifted up; I had left it over the puncheon, it must have been done in the few moments I was ashore.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK, Q.

You do not know how the house was entered - A. No.THE REVEREND GEORGE STOKES . I am a clergyman of the Establishment, and lodge on the second floor of Mr. Russell's house. I came home about eleven o'clock, the street door was then closed. I went to bed about twelve o'clock, and about three I was between asleep and awake, and saw four men in my room standing near my bed; my sitting room door was open, and they stood in a row - they told me to be quiet, and threatened if I did not to shoot me. I am not quite certain but think I saw one pistol. One of them asked who the landlord was, I said nothing; then they left one as guard over me, and I thought he had a pistol - I kept my eyes nearly shut during the time. The other three went into my sitting room - I waited a few minutes, and then gave a sudden spring on the man, and cried out most lustily; he and I had a struggle across the sitting room, to the stair case, I then gave him a push and sent him down stairs; then went up to Mr. Russell and informed him. I believe the other three ran down stairs, for I saw no more of them.Q. Had the man who was guard over you, any light so that you could distinguish his features - A. I think I saw them standing with a candle in one of their hands. I cannot speak to any certainty, whether either of the prisoners are the men. A gold watch, with three gold seals, and a gold chain, worth about 10 l. together was taken from a little table in my bed-room; also a pair of spectacles and a silk handkerchief. I saw the watch and appendages in an hour or two in the hands of Mr. Fitch. I saw the handkerchief at Bow-street, but have not found the spectacles. I saw the prisoners at the watch-house, and from the voice of Desmond I thought he was one.Cross-examined. Q. You will not swear to either of them - A. I only speak to the resemblance of voice. CHARLOTTE LATTY . I am a single woman, and in Mr. Russell's service. I let in Mr. Archer about twenty minutes after Mr. Stokes, then bolted the door, and put the chain up - the windows were all safe. I slept in the kitchen. I went to bed about twelve o'clock, and was not awoke till Mr. Russell came down. I found the office window on the ground floor, at the back of the house open - a pane of glass was broken, which was whole when I went to bed; nearly the whole pane was out - I am sure the window was shut down when I went to bed, and half the shutter shut. When I was alarmed I found all the shutters up and the window up; it looks into the back yard. I had a gold watch, with two gold seals, and a key, worth about 7 l., which was stolen; it hung up over the kitchen dresser; I had shut the kitchen door when I went to bed. I also lost two 5 l. notes, ten sovereigns, and 15 s., from a box on the dresser, which was locked - I found it broken open, and taken into the parlour. A coat belonging to Richard Harrington , the apprentice, was taken from the door of the kitchen closet; it was there when I went to bed. Sixteen silver spoons were taken from a desk in the kitchen, which was not locked - a silver castor worth 1 l., and a silver tea pot, worth 4 l. from the kitchen cupboard. I was not awoke by them.Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure the window was shut down - A. Yes. I was in the office, and looked at the window when I went to bed. I suppose they got out the same way as they got in.MR. RUSSELL. The office is a back room, and looks into Mr. Oddy's yard, and is surrounded by a high wall. I produce a plan of the premises. They could get from New-court, over a high wall, into Mr. Oddy's yard. WILLIAM FITCH . I am a law stationer, and live opposite Mr. Russell's; he is of the same business. The rattlesprang at a little after three o'clock; I dressed myself and came out, it was dark - I immediately went over to Mr. Russell's house, and found the watchmen and neighbours assembled, and saw Desmond in the custody of a watchman in a quarter of an hour. It was supposed other people were in the house, and I was in New-court, and in front of the house, keeping watch to prevent an escape. I found a metal watch without appendages, and a gold watch chain, and seals on the wood work at the top of the wall, in New-court, which I think is fifteen feet high; but there were marks on a lower part of the wall outside, like the scraping of feet, and the inside of the wood work was broken away, and appeared quite fresh. Mr. Stokes claimed the gold watch, and Russell the metal one. FERDINAND O'COLLINS . I am a tax gatherer, and live at No. 16, Carey-street, at the corner of New-court. Mr. Russell's house is at the opposite corner. I was alarmed by a rattle about three o'clock; I got up and went with the constable and watchman into Mr. Platt's house, which is the third house from Mr. Russell's, and communicates with the yard, into which Russell's office looks, and in the back parlour which is used as an office - the window of which was closed, I found Davis concealed under the table; I secured and delivered him to Bowen - he was without his hat, and desired me if I found it to let him have it, I went there thinking the thieves could not have escaped, and must have gone into the adjoining houses.Cross-examined. Q. He might be one of the family for what you know - A. I should have been informed if he was so. MICHAEL BOWEN . I am a watchman. I heard rattles spring - Mr. Russell's door was open. I went in and found no thieves there - I found the back office window up, went to the watch-house for assistance, returned and went into Boswell-court; I came out again, and Mr. O'Collins gave Davis in my charge; I took him to the watch-house, he was without his hat - it was a wet night, his clothes appeared dry; he could not have been out long. Desmond was brought to the watch-house in about a quarter of an hour. THOMAS QUENNELL . I am a watchman of Shire-lane, and Temple Bar. At three o'clock I heard the rattle spring - I came down Carey-street, and heard a scuffle in the two pair of stairs of Russell's house; I stopped at the door, a gentleman put his head out of window and called out thieves! I sprung my rattle, and remained at the street door, and in a short time heard the chain of the door drop, it opened a little way, and I saw the glimpse of three mens faces - I up with my stick and said,""If either of you attempt to come out I will knock your brains out;"" I made a blow at them. They closed the door in my face, and broke my stick. Thomas a watchman came up; I called to the people within to let me in, and in ten or twelve minutes Mr. Russell met me in; Thomas followed me in; we saw the office window open - I heard a rumbling of men in Mr. Oddy's yard, which is enclosed by New-court wall, it has a door leading into the court which was fast. More watchman came up, and I placed them in New-court to prevent an escape that way. Thomas and I called to the private watchman to open the gates of New Boswell-court, and we two (only) went in. We knocked at Mr. Oddy's door and were let in by the servant; we searched in the lower part of the house, but found nobody; we then went into his yard, which the office looks into, and found a silk hat near the window of Mr. Russell's house; it has not been claimed by any person belonging to the house - it was given to Davis at Bow-street to try on, and appeared too small - he said it was not his. We then gained admission into Mr. Platt's house, who has a window looking into the yard; we went through a back door into the yard, and found Desmond in the yard; he said,""Gentlemen, I deliver myself up to you;"" he had no shoes on - he was not known at Mr. Platts. I then asked who were his associates; or thieves with him; he said no person but himself - I said I knew there must be more for I saw three faces in Mr. Russell's house - he still said there was none but himself; I delivered him over to a watchman to take to the watch-house - I then went back to make further search, and after day light found five table, nine tea, and three salt spoons, and a pair of sugar tongs, all silver, on the tiles of an outhouse of Mr. Platt's house, Mr. Russell claimed them. I found six picklock keys of different sizes with them; also two skeleton keys, (one of them broken); a large door key and another small key. As I returned from lodging Desmond at the watch-house, Davis was delivered to me; he was searched at the office, and nothing was found about him. ALEXANDER THOMAS . I am a watchman, my beat is opposite Mr. Russell's. I have heard Quennell's account, it is correct. We found the picklock keys on the tiles of the wash-house, and the spoons. I found in the same place a pistol loaded with powder only; no ball or slugs, and a phosphorus box; also two handkerchiefs, one of which Mr. Stokes claimed, and Russell the other, and also the plate. In Oddy's yard I found a hat. Oddy's servant gave me a coat, a silver tea pot, and a pair of shoes. Russell claimed the tea pot as his own, and the coat as his apprentice's. Desmond had no shoes, and I lent him these to walk to the watch-house, and to Bow-street - they appeared rather too small; he walked with the heels down. Another pair of shoes, and a small iron crow were found in Mr. Stokes's room. I found two chisels with the spoons, and in the yard a dark lantern.(Property produced and sworn to.) JOHN SCOTT . I am a constable. I was alarmed at the watch-house a little after three o'clock, and went to Mr. Russell's. Desmond was given into my charge without any shoes. Fitch delivered me the gold and metal watches.MR. STOKES. When I went to bed my sitting-room door was shut. I found it open after the struggle. I found a pair of shoes, a hat, and an iron crow in my bedroom, which were not there when I went to bed. I found my writing desk forced open, but nothing taken out. JOHN SCOTT . Both the hats were tried on the prisoners, neither of them exactly fitted.DAVIS'S Defence. I know nothing at all of it.DESMOND - GUILTY - DEATH . Aged 17.DAVIS - GUILTY - DEATH .

I live at Little Stanmore; I had twenty lambs, and saw them all safe on Thursday afternoon, the 18th of April, about four o'clock, in a field, close to my house. On Sunday morning, about nine o'clock, I missed one; Pugh fetched me to the next field, where I found the skin, head, and four feet, entrails, and one kidney; I knew to be the skin of one of my lambs. I had taken particular notice of it, as I had sold this and another to a butcher, but this remained in my care, I compared the skin and four feet with some lamb which was found, and can swear it belongs to that skin - we fitted it.Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You sold two - A. Yes; One was gone; he marked this one, but not the one he took away. I saw him mark it, and this was a brown headed one - but the other was not so much brown headed. JOSEPH PUGH . On Sunday afternoon, about two o'clock I was birds nesting, and in Stones's field, next to where his lambs are kept, and I found the skin, head, entrails, four feet, and one kidney.

On the 30th of March, I had eighteen sovereigns in a bag, made from the pocket of an old pair of breeches; it was tied up. I had received ten of the sovereigns from Mr. Blissett, of Leadenhall-street, and six from Mr. York. I counted them on the morning of the 30th of March, and put them into my right-hand waistcoat pocket. I went to the Princess Royal, in Paul-street, and saw the prisoner there; I knew him before. He asked me to take some porter; which I did, and said""You treated me when I had no money to treat myself, and I will treat you now, as I have money."" He said he would have some gin and peppermint; I fetched a quartern from the bar; this was about 11 o'clock. We drank and talked together some time, he came and sat by my side, by the fire-place. I had a pipe which confused me so, that I fell asleep, and about one o'clock, Toogood came and awoke me. I felt and missed the bag and sovereigns.

He then called for a pot, and shewed me an old pocket, which he took from his left-hand waistcoat pocket, and said he picked it up against Mr. Matthews. It was like the one produced; it was an old pocket; I neither saw gold or silver in it, it appeared to have something in it. I left him there, and went back to Matthews, and he missed his pocket and money. I returned to the King's Arms, and he was gone.

Bank-note, and he should know the man who took them. On the Monday between four and five o'clock, he came up again with Wilson who said he knew the man. On the Thursday following about six o'clock, Wilson took me to the King's Head, James-street, where I took the prisoner; he made no resistance. JOHN BARTLETT . I am the beadle. About seven o'clock on Saturday morning, I saw Jones, the prisoner, and Wilson, going up King-street, Long-Acre, and in a few minutes Wilson came and said something to me. I went to the Fountain, public-house, King-street, and found them, and another man in company. I desired the prisoner to go about his business. Jones was very tipsy, and refused every assistance. I could not get him into a coach. I drove the prisoner from him, and thought he was gone safe away, he went towards home with Wilson.Prisoner's Defence.

I have lived in Virginia-row, Bethnal-green for three years - the prisoner has lived in the house all that time; her husband is a weaver; she has had ten children, all living; the youngest child was named Lucy; she was nine months and about a fortnight old. On the 12th of May, I heard her husband go out in the morning; I heard nothing uncomfortable between them. I have the parlour and shop, and they have the one pair - I could hear all that passed in their room. I saw the prisoner about a quarter before eleven o'clock; she rapped loudly at my room door; I opened it, and saw her in a kind of frantic manner; she repeated many times,""I have done it! I have done it! Send for an officer; I want to be hung; I must be hung; I have done it to be hung;"" I said""What have you done?"" she said,""I have killed my child, I have cut its head off."" Seeing her in that frantic state, and throwing herself about, and pulling her clothes about in a wild manner, and foaming at the mouth (froth came out of her mouth) I said,""Poor thing you are agitated, I will send for a doctor;"" she repeated""Send for an officer,"" and shewed me her hands, which were all bloody, and she kept licking the blood off, saying,""Send for an officer."" She asked for a cloth to wipe the blood off her hands. Her manner was wild all this time; she was stamping. I gave her a dry cloth; she looked about as if looking for water, and forced by me into my room - she then took the lid off a saucepan, which was on the fire, and then wiped her hands with the cloth; the steam of the water was then ascending over her head. I immediately went into the room, and she said,""Send for an officer; now the blood is off me, take me - hang me;"" she was still throwing herself about, and pulling he clothes, and stamping - she looked so wild that I was afraid of her. I ran out of the room, and she followed me, and called for an officer again. When I went to the front door, Cranch the officer was there - she kept calling in the same wild manner, saying,""Take me away, and hang me;"" she said to the officer,""I have done it, take me away."" When the officer laid hold of her arm, she said,""I don't run away, I did it to be taken."" She was taken away in about five minutes. She was a kind, and good mother to all her family.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you the least doubt of her being insane at the time - A. I am positive she must be insane.COURT. Q. Had you observed that she was fond of that child - A. She was kind to them all; it was rather a delicate child - she suckled it at this time. I had thought for five or six weeks before, that she seemed to walk in a low, desponding state. She went to a place of worship every Sunday, and was rather of a religious turn - she was sober; she appeared deranged. Nothing occurred to put her out of humour that morning - if there had been words in her family, I must have heard it. She had been attempting to wean the child for three weeks - it often happens that at that time women have a milk fever. She said she had taught it to eat a little, but still gave it the breast at times. I had advised her to wean it as she looked poorly, and about a fortnight before she said it was such a delicate thing she could not bear to wean it.Q. Then she suffered it to prey on her strength rather than hurt the child's health - A. Yes. She spoke very affectionately. Giving the milk now and then would cause the milk to flow into the breast, and keep it fuller than if she suckled it entirely. The fever would be more or less violent according to the quantity of milk - I told her I thought she was hurting herself, by suckling it; she said it was such a delicate little creature, she could not go on with weaning it. ROBERT CRANCH . I am a special constable of Bethnal-green. I was sent for, and got to the house about eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of a man in the passage - the man said,""I want an officer;"" I said""I am one"" - he said""Then I give you charge of this woman, she has committed Murder!"" she said,""I have done it! I have committed wilful Murder!"" Dudley came in in the interval, and I gave her in his charge. I went up stairs to the two pair, which was a weaver's loom-room, and at the top of the stairs I saw a child laying with its head severed from its body; the head laid about a foot from the body; and several streams of blood had flown from the body; a razor laid in one of the streams, which I produce - I immediately returned to the prisoner, and said,""You must go to the watch-house;"" I took her there, and at the watch-house; I asked the cause of her committing so rash an act - she said she had been very uncomfortable in her mind for a long time; that she had received the good things of the Lord, but had lost them - that she had attempted to hang herself three weeks ago, but she could not. I asked if she had attempted to kill her child three weeks ago; she said she had thought of it, and attempted to hang herself that morning to the loom beam. I asked why she committed this act on the youngest in particular; she said she took the youngest because she could do it the easiest.Cross-examined. Q. Were you not obliged to put her on a strait-waistcoat that night or next morning - A. Next morning, she was quite outrageous - she had much more strength than I should have expected from a woman of her appearance. THOMAS BAYLIS . I live opposite the prisoner. I got to the house about a quarter to eleven o'clock, and saw her in the passage. Some people were with her - I was flurried, and did not take particular notice. She said""I have cut my child's head off;"" she caught hold of my coat, and said,""Don't you go up, I have cut it right off, and don't you go up,"" still holding me - I rushed from her, and ran up stairs, and saw the body about a quarter of a yard from stairs. I came down and she was in custody. Before I went up she said,""Take me! Take me!"" CHARLES LEAGOW . I got to the house about half-past ten o'clock; I knew the prisoner many years. WhenI got there she appeared quite in a deranged state, and she looked very wild indeed; I asked her what she had done, she said""I have done it!"" her eyes were continually rolling about. I said,""Mrs. Mountford what have you done!"" she said,""I have done it and want to be taken;"" she repeated this over and over again, in a very wild manner; quite different to what I had seen her before. I went to her at the watch-house afterwards, she then looked very wild; this was between three and four o'clock. Her father-in-law, two of her brothers-in-law, and her sister-in-law were with her; I took her hand, and said.""Mrs. Mountford, how came you to commit this rash act on your child;"" she said,""I want to be hung."" Her hands and eyes kept moving about; she said,""I want to be hung, for I am tired of my life."" She spoke in an agitated way, and repeated it once or twice. I asked if she would not sooner go home to her family than be hung; she said,""No."" I asked if she had any particular dislike to that child than to any of the others; she said,""No.""Cross-examined. Q. You have no doubt of her derangement - A. I am positive she could not be in her right mind; she was a kind and humane mother as ever lived, and has nine children now. I believe every sense of recollection had left her.COURT. Q. Had you observed her conduct to that child - No, she was kind to all; she was of a religious turn for the last ten years; she has been in the habit of going to Meeting; and, I believe, religion and her heavy family have caused this.(The Prisoner being asked for her defence) said,""I wish leave to go home to my family again if it is possible."" PATRICK TUFT . I am the prisoner's brother; when she was about ten years old an accident happened to me, and in consequence of her seeing me she went out of her mind, and was deranged for nearly a month. My mother was deranged in her younger days, and in the latter part of her life, at different intervals. I met the prisoner in the street about eight months ago, and had not seen her since, till she was at the watch-house. When I met her she said she was very well; I saw her twisting and looking back in a deranged manner, I asked what was the matter, she said, she was very poorly and did not know where she was going; it struck me that she was a little deranged.MR. JOSEPH DALTON . I am a surgeon, and live in Carey-street, Lincoln's Inn fields - I attended the prisoner two years and a half ago for a bodily disorder; I perceived her to be a woman of melancholy temper. She had symptoms which indicate a predisposition to insanity, it was a species of insanity which is at times hereditary in families, it is very susceptible to break out at particular intervals. I have known an attempt to wean a child and not accomplishing it, produce insanity; if it was lurking in the habit it would be more likely to break out at that time. When I attended her in 1819, she repeatedly made use of the words,""I have no peace at all,"" and in notes which I have of her case, those words repeatedly occur. I was not at all surprised when I heard she was the subject of insanity. At the time of weaning, the breast remains extremely full of milk, which always produces a degree of irritation. I believe she was an affectionate wife, and had correct parental feelings. NOT GUILTY, being Insane .First Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice Bayley.",notGuilty,nonComposMentis

I live in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, I occasionally go into the country to buy rags, phials, and things. In April last I was in London, and I went to Hatfield; on Monday I was going towards Cockfosters, I saw the prisoner between eight and nine o'clock at night at Cockfosters, where I had some beer, he was outside the house. I gave him part of three or four pints of beer; a young lad was with him, and my mistress was with me. I left the public-house a little past eight o'clock, and crossed the fields to go to Barnet for a lodging, it was about a mile and half off. When I had crossed four or five fields the prisoner overtook me, and another man; and I asked if they were going to Barnet, they walked with me about one hundred yards, then knocked me down; I got up and they knocked me down again; and his companion came behind me while I was on the ground, and took a bottle of liquor out of my pocket, and robbed me of three dozen and four oranges, and a blue purse, containing four pounds in half crowns, shillings and six-pences. The last words the prisoner said were,""If you do'nt be off I will have your life."" I have known him for eight years, I did not know the other man's name, but think he was at the public-house with him. I gave information next morning, and saw the prisoner again two days after. He only knocked me down, we never had any words.Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. The lady you call your mistress is not your wife - A. I married her at the Catholic chapel; she was singing as we crossed the field, and I told her not; I did not strike her. I went to the constable, and saw his wife.

On the 29th of April, about nine o'clock the prosecutor came and wished me to take Beech - I sent him to my partner, and about ten o'clock next morning, the prisoner came and surrended to me; I said the Magistrate was not at home and he must come next day, which he did. If I had not known that he bore a good character, I should not have let him go.Prisoner's Defence. I heard this woman cry Murder! in the fields - I went to assist her, and she said I had saved her life.

The whole I have lost are worth 5 l. each plate, and some of them 10 l., but none less than 5 l. I had frequently met Edwards on the stairs and when he saw me, he always turned back again.

In consequence of this I searched the house of the prisoner Hammerton, but found nothing there relating to the plates. I took Hammerton on board the ship to Edwards, who said,""That is the man I sold the plates to,"" Hammerton said,""You scoundrel, you know nothing of me;"" Edwards said,""I do, you bought the plates; you gave me 6 d. a lb. for the first lot, and 4 d. for the rest.""

I apprehended Flawn in George-street, St. Giles's, on the 22d of April, and asked him if he knew what I wanted him for, he said he did not; I said I wanted him for stealing copper plates; he immediately asked if Edwards was in custody, I said he was; he said Edwards and another boy knew all about them - I asked if he ever carried any plates along with the other boy, he said he lid, to an old iron shop under an archway in Drury-lane; that he should know the man by sight, but did not know his name - I asked if he meant Shorts gardens, he said he did - I asked if he took the plates into the house; he said No, but that Edwards carried them in, as the person would only admit one person into the house at a time - that he had taken some plates on the Saturday week previous, and on that day Edwards brought one half-crown from the man, and on the Monday following he received 14 s., which they shared among them; but Edwards had the best share. I took him to the office, and he pointed out Hammerton from among six or seven other people, as the man who received them; he denied it.

About a month or five weeks ago, I was in Clare-market - Edwards and Flawn brought me a copper plate, tied in a blue apron; Edwards gave it me, and said it was a copper plate, and could I sell it, I said No - they shewed me an old iron shop in Short's gardens, and I took it in; Hammerton took it - he said nothing, but put it in the scale directly, and said,""Here is your money,"" and gave me a half-crown, which I brought out, and gave to Edwards - they gave me sixpence.Cross-examined. Q. Have you been in custody before this - A. No. I job about as a drover. RUSSELL PONTIFEX . I am a manufacturer of copper plates for engravers, and live in Lisle-street, Soho. I think I have seen Hammerton before; I have a very strong suspicion on my mind that he is the man who called on me about the beginning of April to ask what I would give for old copper plates; it was about a fortnight before Mr. Matthews called on me; I told him the price, but he never brought any. The impression is so strong on my mind that if your Lordship said I must swear either that he is or is not the man, I should rather swear that he is.Q. How long were you with him - A. About two minutes. I described him to Mr. Matthews before he was apprehended.MR. MATTHEWS. I have recovered none of this property: the value of one plate is from 8 l. to 10 l.; they were Ward's Sketchings, and some engravings; they were as good as new - the lowest value of any one of them could not be less than 8 l.; they would not sell for less than 5 l. at an auction of the trade, if fair notice was given - old plates always have the engravings erased.EDWARDS'S Defence.

JOSEPH MATTHEWS . I rent a house in the parish of St. Martin in the fields. I lost four copper plates about the begining of April; none of them were worth less than 5 l. Edwards lodged in my house with his father. I think I have seen Flawn in his company. The plates were kept in a place adjoining the kitchen. I found these four at the office. JAMES BEACHEY . I have four plates which I got from the prisoner Gibson, in Dartmouth-street, Westminster. I first saw him on the 19th of April, about half-past seven o'clock at night, standing under an archway in Dartmouth-street, with Flawn and Edwards - I asked what they were doing, they immediately got up - Gibson and Flawn ran away; they had nothing then. I suspected and watched them, and as I came up the street, about eight o'clock that evening, I saw Gibson offering these plates for sale at a shop; I went in and asked what he had in the bag, which stood by his side; he hesitated, and then said it was copper. I found it contained four copper plates of Morland's works; he said his father had sent him to sell them; that his father was a cabinet maker, and lived at No. 9, Great Compton-street - I found he did live there. I asked how his father came by the plates, he said he took them for a bad debt of one Jameson - I asked where Jameson lived; he said it was no use to look for him, he was gone to America. I took him in custody. ALEXANDER MITCHELL . I belong to the Police Vessel. Gibson was brought there on the 19th of April - I went to his father, and next morning his father came on board. I asked Gibson in his father's presence, whether the story he told the night before of his father's sending him to sell them, was true; he said No, it was not - that his father knew nothing of the transaction - that he would tell the truth; that himself and two boys, (whom he named) had got them out of a house on Thursday, where the father of one of those boys lived; they all three took them to George-street, St. Giles's that night, and next morning all three took them to Westminster, and were waiting for the money when the officer took him. I apprehended Edwards in consequence of information, and told him I took him for stealing a quantity of copper plates; he at first said he knew nothing about them, but afterwards, that he was in company with the boys when the plates were got, but he did not steal them. He was speaking of these four plates; he named Gibson as one of the two boys. He said they were taken on Thursday night to George-street, and they were all waiting at Westminster, when they saw the officer pass. CHARLES GREEN . I am an officer. I apprehended Flawn on the 22d of April, and told him it was for stealing copper plates; he said Edwards and the other boy knew all about them, but he knew nothing.MR. MATTHEWS. They are mine. The four would cost 20 l. engraving; they would now sell for 5 l. each.

I came to London on the 15th of May, and lodged in the Hackney-road - about eight o'clock, I and my wife were going to Maiden-lane; we had each a bundle, and she had my arm; we were going along Long-alley, and when I got to Angel-alley, I saw a man standing four or five yards off with his hat on, he cocked it up, and stood still at the corner of Angel-alley - any one down the alley could see him, and just before I got up to him, he pulled his hat down just above his eyes - when I came down to him I received a blow backhanded, across my nose, and a hand snatched out my watch, which was fatened by a chain round my neck. I put my hand down and pulled up my watch before it broke, and these two bits I caught in my hands; it was a violent blow I received, more than the weight of a man's hand - I suppose there was some weighty substance besides the hand, either iron or stone - the blood came from my nose. I let go my wife's arm, and called Stop thief! pursuing him down Angel-alley, where he ran. I should have overtaken him, but three men stood in the alley, and gave way to let him through. One of them in an apron caught hold of me, and asked what was the matter - I rushed through them, and saw a man turn round a corner to the right; he was the same man who struck me and took my watch - Ramsay is the man to the best of my knowledge - the impress on my mind is such as to leave no doubt of his being the man. The men who stopped me were about twenty-five yards from the corner.Q. Did you call Stop thief! before they stopped you - A. Yes, and after I got through them; they were in sight when I called Stop thief, and near enough to hear me call. Greenwood was the man who had the apron on, and Bowers was with him; after I got through them, they turned to look after me; and when I lost sight of the man, I saw three or four women, I asked them for a drop of water to wash the blood off my face, which they refused. I suppose the man who struck me went into the house, but I did not see him go in. At six o'clock the next night I saw the three prisoners in the watch-house; I had described them to the officer; I knew them as soon as I saw them; it was not dusk; the alley is dark. I did not suspect he was going to ill use me, it was done in a moment; he did not speak. I noticed his face. I had not run many yards when I saw the other man; I believe Ramsay to be the person; I did not see his face after he got the watch. Greenwood hustled me, and Bowers stood on his right. MARY STRAUGHTON . I am the wife of Thomas Straughton . I went from Maiden-lane with him towards Hackney-road - I had hold of his arm, and on entering the alley, I was on his left hand side; he was nearest the wall. We came to Angel-alley, several people wanted to pass; I drew a foot back to let them pass - my attention was called to those people, and when we got to the end of Angel-alley, I was giving way for them - my husband gave a sudden spring; he ran down the alley; I went on, and found him panting for breath, and his nose was bloody. I cannot swear to any of the men - I saw four men. I was agitated, but I think the man who ran away from him was taller than the prisoners. HENRY MAGNUS . I am a constable. On the 15th of May I was called by a boy to go to Straughton, and found him bleeding in the nose. In consequence of what he informed me I went in search, but without success. I went next day with Gregory, and found the three prisoners about five o'clock in the afternoon, at a public-house, in Skinner-street, Bishopsgate, playing at skittles - it is about one hundred yards from Angel-alley - when they saw us, I saw a change in their countenances. They went on with the game in a confused state; we took them to the watch-house. Gregory fetched Straughton - he saw them in the watch-house, and identified the whole three. They said they knew nothing about it. JOSEPH GREGORY . I was with Magnus, and apprehended the prisoners.RAMSAY'S Defence. I was at the Spotted Dog, public-house, Bishospgate, at the time.GREENWOOD'S Defence. I was with him.BOWERS'S Defence. I stood in the alley when the man was robbed, with two young men - his voice was so low nobody could hear him call Stop thief! the two men I was with had their backs towards him, and I stood sideways. A man rushed in between them, and went down a turning - a boy took the gentleman to the officer, and I stood nearly in the same place, when Magnus came and looked me in the face. HENRY MAGNUS . I do not recollect seeing Bowers in the alley. There were several people there. MARGARET HARTLETT . I live in Greenhill-rents, Angel-alley, and have known Bowers about a year and a half. Last Wednesday week, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock at night, I went into Sun-street for some oil, and as I returned in the alley, five young men came against me - they passed me, and in a moment or two I saw the prosecutor run by out of Long-alley - Bowers was not one of the men, for I saw him come out of his own door as I went into mine; he lives opposite me, and bears a most excellent character; he keeps regularly at his work.MR. BOLLAND. Q. Where do you live - A. In Reeves's-rents. I go out charring. I will swear he is an honest industrious man. JAMES GOODYEAR . On the evening of the robbery, at twenty minutes or half-past eight o'clock, I saw Bowers at the corner of the alley, just by the George, public-house, talking to a man named Fenley; I stood talking to them, and in a minute somebody ran by me calling Stop thief! he brought an officer soon after - Bowers was then talking to me.MR. NORTON. Q. What are you - A. A weaveress. I was talking to him for a quarter of an hour before I heard the cry.Q. Bowers was not at home then for some time before the robbery - A. No. I did not hear the cry till the man had passed me some time. I know Ramsay and Greenwood by sight. I did not see them that night. I use the house they frequent.COURT. Q. Are you sure Ramsay is not the man who ran by - A. I am. I have seen him with the other prisoners, but not exactly in their company. JOSEPH GREGORY re-examined. I have known Bowers for six years; his character has been bad all that time - he is always idling about the alley with notorious thieves. They are all three acquainted, and I have seen Goodyear drinking at the George with them. NOT GUILTY .Second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice Bayley.",notGuilty,none

He told me to take his horse, and take care of it, and he should not be there again before Wednesday. I never saw him after.Cross-examined. Q. He never came for it - A. He was there for it, but I did not see him. He left it with me three weeks and two days.Q. He might have said,""Take care of this horse and cart, which a man sent me with"" - A. No. He did not, I am positive. I noticed what he said, and am sure he said it was his. JOHN HAYFORD . I am a constable. I received the prisoner in charge from Elkington last Tuesday afternoon at his house. JAMES ELKINGTON re-examined. On Tuesday last he came into the yard while I was washing the horse's legs; he said,""You have been out with the horse,"" I said,""Yes I have taken it to Whitechapel to exercise it;"" he said that was right. I had been told it was stolen half an hour before this, and sent for the constable, who took him.Prisoner's Defence. On the 28th of April, about half-past ten o'clock I was coming home, and met a middle aged man in Sutton-street; he said he would give me 1 s. to take the horse and cart to the Horse and Groom - I did so, and said""I have brought this horse and cart to put up;"" he said very well, and I left. Last Tuesday I met a man at the corner of Aylesbury-street, he said""Will you go to the Horse and Groom for such a horse, and ask the man 9 l. for it"" - I went and asked him 9 l. JAMES ELKINGTON re-examined. Q. Did he ask you 9 l. for it - A. Yes, my Lord, and I said I would give 7 l. He said I had done very right in exercising it, and said""I think I shall sell him, for he is hardly big enough for my cart;"" I said""If you like to sell it, I will buy it, and sell you a bigger."" I went into the stable, and shewed him abigger horse, and offered him 7 l. for his. Hayford whom I had sent for, came in and took him in charge.Four witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.

BOLLAND conducted the prosecution. SARAH GOODRICK . I lodge at Mr. Gladell's as servant to the first floor lodgers; the prisoner Foster lodges there. On the morning of the 28th of April I got up first, and unfastened the street door which I found fastened as usual, and the yard door as well. I found the kitchen window a little open, it runs in a groove sideways; I cannot say how it was the night before.WILLIAM STRICKLAND GEORGE GLADELL. I am the son of the prosecutor. On the 28th of April I got up exactly at eight o'clock, and found the kitchen strewed all over with rags, and the drawers all open.Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You were not up first - A. No. WILLIAM STRICKLAND GLADELL . I live in the parish of St. John, Clerkenwell. On the night of the 27th of April all the linen was deposited in the kitchen, in a double chest of drawers. My wife had been washing, and they were filled with all the linen we possessed. Foster came to lodge with us in July last, and occupied the back room on the second floor. Worboys and his wife came frequently to visit Foster. I cannot say whether I saw them for a day or two before the 28th of April. On the morning of the 28th, my little boy screamed out, I went down into the kitchen and found the drawers all plundered of every thing they had contained over night; I had seen them safe between ten and eleven o'clock; I believe I was the last that went to bed at night; I fastened the kitchen window myself by a screw, and secured it top and bottom. I found a square of glass broken, and the window a little open, but it was impossible that a hand put in there could unscrew it. I missed six sovereigns from the scrutoire, some knives and forks, an India shawl, and some trinkets. My friends wished me to search my lodgers, I declined it; but on the Thursday morning my wife's mother shewed me a brooch which caused suspicion to fall on Foster. I sent for an officer and a lock-smith who opened Foster's trunk in her bed-room; she was out and had left the key of her room with my wife's mother. I found that every thing in the trunk belonged to me; we then went into her little room adjoining the bed-room; I found that a mouse-hole which I knew was there, had grown large enough for me to put my hand in, and from both sides of the hole the officer found four curtain-pins, two irons, a blind, some sugar, five eggs, a tea caddie, and various other articles. Foster came home that night about eight o'clock; she went up stairs and found her bed-room door locked; she came down to know the reason, and the officer took her and Mrs. Worboys who came home with her; Worboys declared she was quite innocent, and accused Foster with being a base woman; they were taken to the watch-house. We got a warrantto search Worboys. On the 2d of May we went there nearly at nine o'clock at night, and found him at a public-house close by; he was taken to the watch-house and searched in my presence, but nothing particular found. In Foster's pocket several trinkets of ours were found, and a key which she was asked about, and said it was a key which Worboys got made to fit our kitchen door. She said in his presence that on Monday, the 22d of April, when we were out, Worboy got the key made, and he assisted her in committing the robbery; he and his wife denied it. I found the key fitted the kitchen door very well, it was an old key filed. At Worboys's house we found a small bible, a towel, two petticoats, an ironing cloth, and some strips of muslin; the brooch is mine, and was taken from the scrutorie.Cross-examined Q. Did you find any thing at Worboys that Foster was unlikely to have of her own - A. No. MARTHA MATILDA GLADELL . I am the wife of the prosecutor - Foster lodged at the house. Worboys was continually coming to her. On the evening of the 22d of April, Foster was ironing for me all day; she was called out by Worboys in the course of the day - she was not absent long; she went out about eight o'clock in the evening, and said she was going to Mr. Worboys's - she returned in half an hour; she assisted me in putting linen away. Before we left the kitchen, we found all the linen safe. In the scrutoire there was a shawl, knives and forks, six sovereigns, and a bag of trinkets and other things. I know the brooch was in the bag that night.COURT. Q. Worboys was intimate with her - A. Yes. She went that evening to take a hat as a present for their child. JOHN HAYFORD . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoners. On Foster I found a quantity of trinkets and things, which the prosecutor claimed. I found more property in her trunk, and some concealed under her floor. I found a variety of duplicates of the property on Foster, and also a key, which will open the kitchen. JOHN LIMBRICK . I searched Worboys's house, No. 1, Pump-court, and found a book, two pockets, a towel, a shirt, a frill, and some muslin in the front parlour cupboard, thrown among a parcel of rubbish.Cross-examined. Q. There was no appearance of concealment - A. No. JAMES KING . I am a pawnbroker. Foster pawned a variety of linen on the 2d of May. JOHN BURGESS . I am a pawnbroker. Worboys the woman, pawned two pair of trowsers with me on the 1st of May. WILLIAM TILLIER . I am a pawnbroker. I have a petticoat pawned by the two women, Foster and Worboys. WILLIAM WARRE . I am a pawnbroker. I have a sheet and whittle, which two women brought. Mrs. Worboys was one of them. MARTHA MATILDA GLADELL. The property is all ours, and was in the house on the night. I found a key in Foster's drawer, which fits the scrutoire. The value of all the is property 15 l. That produced is worth 12 l. JAMES WORBOYS 'S Defence.

I saw the prisoner help the other man over the wall; he then came and opened the stable door, and let the prisoner in; they came out in a quarter of an hour, shut the door, and looked up and down the passage several times till the clock struck six; then both went into the stable, and threw open a pair of large doors, and the prisoner was hauling the truck out, and the other one pushed behind; he shut the doors, they then trailed the truck down the passage. I ran across and told Wiskin, who took the prisoner. FREDERICK SKINNER . I live next door to Fowling. On the 18th of May, about a quarter past six o'clock I saw the prisoner; Wiskin was holding him, and gave him to me; I searched him and found a crow bar in his possession, and a chisel in the cart.

SAMUEL DOBSON . I am a beadle and live at Dean-street, Mile End. I know all the prisoners, they live in the neighbourhood. William Platt sold braces about the streets. On Monday the 2d of April, I was fetched about two o'clock to Bow Common, and found the prisoners there; I went to part them, understanding they were fighting; but I found a large mob, and dare not interfere; the fight continued one hour and forty minutes. Dighton and Buckmaster were seconds to Snellgrove; Boyd and Smith, to the deceased. I saw the deceased walking about the streets on the next afternoon; he died about four o'clock on Wednesday morning. The fight appeared perfectly fair, and the seconds did not at all urge them to fight.Q. Perhaps you are not sure that they were seconds - A. They held them up when they fell. I know that on Tuesday, Platt drank a great quantity of gin and spruse. WILLIAM FORDHAM . I am a constable. I was at the beginning of the fight - they were brought into the ring, and began to fight. The mob would not let me interfere to prevent it; I could not part them; they both appeared determined to fight, and fought very fair. When they parted, Platt appeared to be hurt by a fall; they both fell - there was very little blood. He did not complain but appeared to hang down his head; he was carried away in a cart.Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Was it a jolting cart - A. Yes. SAMUEL DESERT . I am a weaver, and live at Bethnal-green. I know Snellgrove, Dighton, and Buckmaster. I saw Snellgrove a fortnight before the fight took place, and he said he expected to fight - I also saw him the day before the fight; he said he meant to fight, but he liked the deceased as well as his own brother. GEORGE GALLOWAY . I am a weaver. I was present at the fight. There appeared no malice; it was perfectly fair - I saw it all. I saw Platt helped up into the cart. JOSEPH COOK . I saw the fight from the beginning to the end. I never saw a more fair battle. I knew none of them before - the deceased did not appear so much hurt as Snellgrove. GEORGE ATCLIFF . I am a green-grocer, and live at Mile End. I knew all the parties - Snellgrove was fighting Platt; I saw it all, it was a fair fight. The deceased did not appear much hurt; they were both carried away in men's arms. Platt came into my shop about eight o'clock, and said he was as well as ever he was, except his face; he walked away eating oranges - he had been drinking; I cannot say whether he was sober or not - I thought he looked as if liquor had affected him. I saw him about half-past eleven o'clock again, he was then poorly; I stopped half an hour with him - he said he was better, and began to reach very violent. WILLIAM GREEN . I am an apothecary, and live in Whitechapel-road. I was called to the deceased on Wednesday morning, and found him insensible; he died aboutsix o'clock. I opened his head; there was an extravasation of blood on the brain, which occasioned his death; I cannot say it was produced by the fight; it was too extensive to come from a blow, it might be from a fall - I think it could not be produced by intoxication; it appeared to be from great violence, and could not have happened above three days previous.SNELLGROVE - GUILTY .

I could swear to the one who drew my watch; it was not the prisoner. The second man was dressed like the prisoner - he was taken on the 10th; I saw him at Worship-street. CAROLINE GARDNER . I live at a public house in Mulberry-court, Whitecross-street. I was coming outside the door, which is about twenty-four yards from Ansell's house; I saw four men just turn the corner coming into the court; I crossed over the road and stood at a window, and saw the one who walked on first had a light short jacket, and the second was the prisoner; he was dressed as he is now. Three or four minutes after, Mr. Ansell came walking along very quick, and said he had been robbed by four young men. I told him what I had seen; the four men went down Long-alley. On the 10th of May, Brown brought the prisoner to Mr. Ansell's shop; I was sent for. I said he was one; I am sure of it; they were running along very quick; there are two lamps by the spot, but it was not quite dark; the third man caught hold of my arm and spilt my beer, which made me notice them.

About half-past eight o'clock on Tuesday I was leaving work, and heard a bustle; the noise appeared to come from Mulberry-court; and as soon as I got to the end of the alley I saw four men running from Whitecross-place, and a number of people calling after them; they ran close past me. I firmly believe the prisoner to be the second man; I had observed him for twelve yards coming towards me, and when they came up they almost made a stand, and said,""Which way is he gone, Stop him! Stop him!"" and all ran on again - the first man said this. I saw the prisoner at Worship-street on Friday, he sat in the parlour with others, and when I went in I did not know he was a prisoner; I said to Ansell,""That is one of the party."" JAMES BROWN . I am a constable. I took the prisoner at the Rum Puncheon, public-house, Long-alley, Shoreditch, on the 10th. I said I wanted him to walk with me, and he came. I took him to Mr. Ansell's, and fetched Gardner; he said he was at the Rum Puncheon at the time of the robbery; it is about three hundred yards from the spot, in the same road the thieves took after the robbery. Evans pointed him out at the office, and said, he had not the least doubt of him.Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Rum Puncheon at the time. ELIZA OTTERY . I live in Rose and Crown-court, opposite the Rum Puncheon, and keep a green grocer's shop there. I have known the prisoner about four months. I went into the Rum Puncheon on the night of the robbery, to call a young man out named Dent; the prisoner was then standing in the tap-room, and Dent was accused of the robbery. I went in directly as the thieves ran round the corner; there was a cry of Stop thief! The prisoner came out to see what I wanted with the man. I was at home when the prisoner was taken, and said to the officers that he was in the house when the thieves ran by. I told Walton and Brown so. WILLIAM PERKINS . I live in King-square, Horse-shoe alley, Finsbury, and am a shoemaker. I have known the prisoner twelve months; I do not know his business. On the evening of the 7th of this month (Tuesday,) I was coming through Rose and Crown-court, and saw him enter the Rum Puncheon at a little after eight o'clock; he was alone. I heard Bishopsgate bell ring eight at the time. I went towards home, and three men ran past me in Hand-alley, saying,""What a lark;"" the prisoner was not one of them; this was about two hundred yards from the public-house. When they passed me, I heard the cry of Stop thief!Q. Did you join in pursuit - A. No. I was at home on the night Ansell was robbed. I have known the prisoner a month or two; he is often at our house. A mob came running down the alley after the thieves, and I ran out; the prisoner was not in the house then. One Dent was there, nursing his child; Avell, Carmichael, and him, were the only persons in the house at the time. I had been in the house a quarter of an hour or ten minutes, and did not see Ottery. If Dent had been fetched out I must have seen it. I was at my door when the thieves ran by. I know Perkins by sight, if he had gone by about this time I think I must have seen him. The prisoner lives in Still-alley. JAMES BROWN re-examined. I did not see this woman till I returned from the office; she then said, the prisoner was standing at the door at the time of the robbery; I asked if she was certain of it, she said she could not be sure, but thought he was the person.

I found four or five small pieces of beef about the store-room floor - the candles were all dips of different sizes, some were shoemakers candles, which are quite different from others, they have two wicks. My father's name is James.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When were you last in the workshop - A. After nine o'clock; I fastened it up. EDWARD TILLEY . I have known the prisoner about two years. Razell lives in Haman's-place, Kingston, and Coombs at Hampton-wick. Razell came to my house one night, and asked if I would go out; I said I would, and fixed to meet him at Coombs's at ten o'clock, which I did, and we all three went across Bushey Park, and came out by Hampton-gate, and went along right under the wall towards Hampton, and met the watchman; they wished the watchman good night, and he said,""Good night."" We then went up the road for the George, public-house, at Sunbury, and turned into a yard on the left hand, then came out to Sunbury, at the back part of the town, and laid down to sleep in a cart-lodge, as Razell said it was too soon to go. In about an hour and a half we went to the tallow-chandlers shop; Razell unlocked the door with something, and all three went in; the prisoners went into another room and struck a light; we had two sacks and a basket, which we filled. Razell said, as we went along, that he had been there once before, and there was a dog there, and he had got meat to give the dog; and I think he said he had a key which would fit the place. They each took a sack, and I the basket, we went about half a mile across the fields to a gentleman's house, within forty yards of the road; it was an empty house, we put the candles in the cellar there and went home. They said, we must go and get Taylor's horse and cart to bring them away next night, and I agreed to meet them at Coombs's at eight o'clock. I got there rather behind my time, they were gone; I overtook Coombs standing by the cart, just by the bridge; he asked why I was not there sooner; I said, I did not think of coming. He went on to the house, leaving me to stop with the cart till I heard a whistle, which I did in about twenty minutes, and went on till I saw them in the road opposite the house; they took the candles and basket out of a ditch and put them into the cart; we got back to Coombs's about nine o'clock in the morning, and there looked the candles over and weighed them. One hundred and twenty pounds were fit for sale; we divided the broken ones between us. I had about twelve pounds of spoiled ones that night, and left the rest there; my share was about forty pounds; my wife fetched them. Razell afterwards paid me 11 s. as my share of the others, and said there would be 5 s. more between us. I was apprehended about nine weeks after the robbery, and six or seven of the shoemaker's candles were found at my house. Coombs sent a boy home with the cart.Cross-examined. Q. How old are you - A. Thirty. I live at Kingston, in Caroline-place. My father is in Sussex. I have been in Petworth Gaol. I have five brothers, one of them is in Horsemonger-lane, and one in Newgate.Q. How many gaols have you been in - A. About three. I cannot tell how many robberies I have been engaged in. I have gone by the names of Boxall, and King. I once escaped from an officer. I was in the cage when I told of this robbery.Q. How often did the Magistrate persuade you, before you mentioned the prisoners names - A. I mentioned it at first.Q. How often in the month of February had you crossed Bushey Park - A. Only this once, I think. The watchman had no lantern that I saw.Q. Are you the man who broke out of Petworth Goal - A. Yes; I was not re-taken, I went about the country.Q. Thieving - A. Yes.MR. BOLLAND. Q. Had you crossed the park with the prisoner, except on these nights - A. No. JOHN HATCHETT . I am a watchman, my beat is straight through Hampton-wick. On the night of 13th of February I heard of this robbery. On the night before I was on duty, and the prisoners passed me about twenty minutes past ten o'clock by the park-keeper's house, another man was with him who I did not know; they said""Good night Jack,"" and I said,""Good night."" I saw no basket or sacks.Cross-examined. Q. Do you watch constantly. - A. All the winter. I saw them about two miles from Sunbury. JAMES TAYLOR . I live at Sunbury, and have a horse and cart. On the 13th of February about five o'clock in the afternoon Razell came and engaged it for two hours, I was to send it to Coombs's at six o'clock; my son took it, and a strange lad brought it back between eight and nine o'clock.Cross-examined. Q. He frequently had the cart of you - A. Yes. JAMES TAYLOR . I took the cart to Coombs, he said that would do.- WALTERS. I went to Tilley's house and got six candles, which I produce. HENRY NEAL . I am Mr. Shotter's candle-maker, and dipped these candles myself. Some like them were in the manufactory on the night of the robbery.COOMBS - GUILTY . Aged 20.RAZELL - GUILTY . Aged 56.

t18220522-89,violentTheft,highwayRobbery,death,none,18220522,"ROBERT CRAWLEY and JAMES NEUMHIER were indicted for feloniously assaulting Edward Bowerbank , on the King's highway, on the 23d of May, at St. Leonard, Shoreditch, putting him in fear, and taking from his person, and against his will, one watch, value 8 l.; one key, value 6 d., and one ribbon, value 2 d. , his property. EDWARD BOWERBANK . I live in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. On Thursday the 23d of May, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was passing down Kingsland-road; I had a metal watch worth 8 l. in my fob, with a ribbon and key - I was alone, and as I was in the act of passing the end of a private road, called King's-road, two persons were behind a toll box, which is at the corner; and the moment I approached this toll box, the two persons rushed from there with great force, with their elbows against my breast; I staggered a pace or two, and at the same moment received a tremendous blow on my breast, which knocked me down about a yard and a half fromwhere I received the blow; it drove me more into the road before I fell, and at the moment of receiving the blow I felt my watch snatched from me. I am perfectly sure that the prisoner Neumhier is one of the two, but not the person who snatched the watch. When I was on the ground the man who took my watch let it drop about a yard and a half from me, and I crawled on my hands and knees towards it, but he was too quick for me, and snatched it up and ran away. As I was endeavouring to get up, the two prisoners passed me - I had not seen Crawley in the transaction before; I took particular notice of him - I at first thought he might be only a person who was passing, till I saw him with Neumhier - I noticed his features, and am quite sure he is the one who ran off with Neumhier, I had seen him repeatedly before. I pursued them nearly to the top of the King's-road, crying""Stop thief!"" and never lost sight of them till they turned the corner of Ivy-lane; before that I saw three young men come out of a house called the High House, and join in the pursuit. I came up in less than ten minutes to where they were stopped, and saw them in a public-house where they were conveyed, and am certain of their persons, perfectly so. The watch was shewn to me before I got to the public-house. I felt very sore for two or three days from the blow and bruises occasioned by the fall, and my hands were lacerated with the gravel.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. This was only five days ago, and you are quite recovered - A. No; I am not. Two persons rushed against me, a blow immediately followed, and while on the ground the prisoner passed me; the blow and my falling were almost instantanious, I staggered a little, the person who struck the blow and took the watch has escaped. I saw Neumhier rush on me, and then pass me, my attention was more upon him than the one who escaped. I am perfectly certain that the watch was not taken till after the blow was struck, and when I was in the act of falling; I staggered a yard and a half.Q. You at first thought the third person was only passing by - A. Yes, till I saw him with Neumhier. I had not called Stop thief when I saw him. His face was quite familiar to me, I did not know his name, they ran about three quarters of a mile.Q. Do you mean to say you had such a view of them that if you had met them a month afterwards in the street you should know them - A. I think I should directly; perhaps I might have passed them a month after, and not notice them. THOMAS COLLINS . I live in King's-road, Hoxton, at the High House, and am a seal skin-dresser. Last Thursday evening I was at home, and heard a noise, I ran to the gate and saw Mr. Bowerbank covered with dust, holding up his stick and saying""Stop those rascals, those thieves!"" pointing to the prisoners who were about twenty yards before him; I pursued, they turned to the left, and then down Ivy-lane; a man named Rump stopped them, before I lost sight of them; it was the two prisoners. I laid hold of Crawley opposite the Unicorn, public-house, I took him into the house, he scuffled and struck me a blow under the ear, and using a bad word, he said he would serve me out when he got loose again; I let him go, and seized him again immediately, and got him into the public-house, and the other was brought in directly; Bowerbank came in in five minutes, and said he could swear to them both.Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say they turned to the left, and then to the right, down Ivy-lane - A. Yes; I did nor loose sight of them, I saw three persons in Ivy-lane; I saw the prisoners when they turned the corner; Crawley did not say that he knew nothing about it, he said he would serve me out; he said at the public-house, that I had nothing to do with it, he had done nothing.MR. BRODRICK to MR. BOWERBANK. Q. While you were getting up and saw the two persons, was the other man running away - A. He was before; I at first thought Crawley might be a man who might assist me. He made no attempt to stop the man.Q. Had you such a view of Neumhier, that if he had not run away, you would have charged him with it - A. Certainly. JAMES SPARKS . I live at Hoxton, and work with Collins at the High House. I heard a hollowing, and ran out and saw Mr. Bowerbank all over dust, holding up his stick and saying,""Stop thief,"" I looked towards Hoxton and saw the two prisoners running about twenty yards off, I pursued and never lost sight of them. I stopped Neumhier; somebody laid hold of him when I came up. Collins took Crawley; a scuffle ensued between Collins and Crawley about which public-house they should go to, whether to the Green Man or the Unicorn; and in the scuffle I saw the watch behind Crawley, I saw it in the act of falling to the ground, it fell at his heels, and I think it must have fallen from him; a sailor picked it up and gave it to me. Bowerbank claimed it.Cross-examined. Q. You suppose it fell from him - A. Yes. I do not think it could have fallen from any one else; I saw it fall. Collins had hold of him, and a third man wanted them to go to the Green Man; there was a great mob, but the watch could not have fallen from them, it was too near to him; I saw it in the act of falling; the sailor boy who picked it up is not here; he offered it to me, but I would not take it, and told him to take it to the gentleman. I believe it to be the same from the colour of the case. HENRY SWAIN . I am a seal-skin manufacturer. I was in the High House, and heard the alarm; I came out and saw the prosecutor waving his stick, crying out,""Stop thief! Stop those rascals!"" pointing to the prisoners who were not above forty yards from him. I joined in pursuit, and never lost sight of them. Sparks had hold of Neumhier and asked me to assist him which I did, and in the middle of the road the prisoners wished to go to the Green Man, and said they would not go to the Unicorn. Crawley scuffled with Collins; Neumhier tried to get to Collins, and I perceived Crawley throw the watch down; I saw it come out of his hands; a sailor picked it up and gave it to me; I gave it to the officer.Cross-examined. Q. You will not swear the watch he threw down was the same that the prosecutor claimed - A. Yes. I stood close by Crawley - the sailor boy brought it to me in the public-house in about five minutes; they would not let him come in at first. It had a black ribbon to it, and so had the one I saw him throw down. JOHN RUMP . I am a porter at Hungerford-market. Ihad been to see my brother, and saw the prisoners run down Coffee-house-walk together; and as they passed me they asked if I had seen a man run by, I made no answer but observing a great many men running down the walk after them, crying Stop thief! I gave a child which I had in my arms to a person to hold, then ran and stopped Crawley, who ran through the Bacchus, public-house. Sparks came up directly and laid hold of him; I kept hold of him and saw Crawley stopped; they wanted to go to the Green - Man we took them to the Unicorn; there was a scuffle between Crawley and Collins. Bowerbank came into the Unicorn and said they were the men who had robbed him.Cross-examined. Q. Crawley ran through a public-house - A. Yes, and I ran through after him. I lost sight of him for an instant; I was not ten yards behind him. Crawley asked, if I had seen a man run by; they did not stop to ask, but kept on. There was a great deal of confusion. MARIA WOOD . I am servant to Mr. Whitehead, of Ball's-pond. I met the prisoner Crawley in the Kingsland-road, between six and seven o'clock, a few yards from the King's-road; two more men stood behind the toll-box. Crawley turned back and went up to them, and before they went up to the gentleman, I heard them say, they would have one before an hour passed over their heads. I did not know what they meant. I saw the prosecutor standing in King's-road; they all three rushed from the box and knocked him down. I saw him fall, and was so frightened I could not call out; I saw one of them snatch the watch from his fob; that was neither of the prisoners; they all three ran up King's-road. I saw the prisoners at Worship-street next day, and was sure of them. I am still in my master's service.Cross-examined. Q. You never saw Crawley before - A. No. I had no conversation with him: when I met him I noticed that he looked very pale. The gentleman did not speak to me, I was about two yards from him, he got up, and hollowed""Stop thief!"" holding his stick up. My master has a situation in the Bank of England.COURT. Q. Did you see what became of the watch - A. The man who knocked the gentleman down, gave it into Crawley's hands, and bid him run, and said, if they came after him they would stop them; they were close to me at the time; I saw that the watch ribbon was dark, and I thought there was a seal to it, but it seems it was only a key. BENJAMIN ABEL . I am a constable. The prisoner was delivered into my charge, and Swain gave me the watch, which I produce.MR. BOWERBANK. It is my property.NEUMHIER'S Defence. I saw the gentleman lay on the ground. Crawley ran down the road, and I ran after him; the man who had the watch ran through a public-house; we were in the street some time before any one came up.CRAWLEY's Defence. I was passing along the corner of the King's-road, and saw the gentleman on the ground, and a man in blue, running; I made after him directly; I met a man, and asked if he saw a man run that way - he made no answer - I kept on running, and was stopped.Six witnesses gave Crawley a good character, and five deposed the same on behalf of Neumhier.CRAWLEY - GUILTY - DEATH .

I live at Cashel in the County of Tipperary, in Ireland. I first became acquainted with the prisoner the latter end of May, 1815; he stopped nearly a week at my father's house before he married my sister Mary - I was present at the marriage at my father's; my sister Julia, my brother, my father and many other witnesses were present. The Reverend Doctor Wright married them, he is now dead - he was a Roman Catholic priest; my sister and the prisoner were both of that religion.Q. How do you know that was the prisoner's religion - A. He brought a certificate to Doctor Wright, stating that he was a Catholic. I never saw him at a Catholic chapel before he married her - he represented himself as a Catholic by bringing a certificate from his parish priest; he always passed as a Catholic, and always joined in our religious duties, particularly in the Rosary, which is family prayer, and he said he had a brother in the Maynooth College educating for a priest. After the marriage ceremony they both lived together and cohabited at my father's house, as man and wife, for a week, and then he got a part of my sister's fortune, and went to Dublin, wrote a letter, and then his wife and a married sister went to him. The prisoner returned to my father's house about a year afterwards and stopped about a fortnight; Mrs. Burke was not with him - she has two children, one of them is now at my mother's; my father is dead. The prisoner failed in business afterwards, and applied to us for money, 20 l. was given him - I have seen my father give him 100 l. note at one time. My sister Mary is now living, I saw her here to day.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was your father - A. A leather merchant. The prisoner was a publican and grocer, at Dublin, which is seventy-five Irish miles from Cashel. I understood that he came from Dublin on no other business but to marry my sister - his brother Edmund Burke , was present at the marriage. I am about twenty-three years old, my sister Julia is about two years younger than I. Doctor Wright performed the marriage, and Father O'Brien was there in the course of the evening - I cannot say whether he was present at the marriage; it was performed between five and six o'clock in the evening.Q. Was it not between eleven and twelve o'clock at night - A. It was not. There was merry making on that day, and the next. The prisoner took but one glass of wine that day, he would take no more. My sister went to him about a fortnight after the marriage. JULIA BUTLER . I am sister of the last witness. I know the prisoner - my sister Mary was married to him at my father's house; they were both Roman Catholics - the prisoner always passed as such at our house, and at the time of Lent, he assisted in offering up the Rosary, and read the meditations himself; (looking at a Catholic manual) I believe the writing in this to be his, I have frequently seen him write; it is a Roman Catholic book. My sister had two children, I was present when one was born - there is an entry of it in this book in his writing;"" Norah Burke , born the 20th of November, 1816; Johannah, the 24th of June"" - I was in his house when one of the children was baptized, and after the baptism I took a glass of wine with the prisoner and the priest, who performed the ceremony. After the marriage he went to Dublin, my sister Mary also went. I lived with them afterwards at Clonmell for four or five months, and at that time I have seen him in the Catholic chapel.Cross-examined. Q. What age were you at the time they were married - A. About twelve. I had not seen him at Cashel till a week before. He came from Dublin to be married to my sister; she had been at Dublin before that - I never saw him at a Catholic chapel before the marriage, that I recollect. My father and all his family are Catholics. They were married about nine o'clock in the evening, I believe.Q. Will you swear it was not as late as twelve o'clock - A. Yes I will; it was after eight o'clock, for it was just duskish, and in the month of June. The Reverend DoctorWright performed the ceremony - I do not think there was any other priest there, but the next day there was a large party, and Mr. O'Brien was there.Q. Where have you seen this manual before to day - A. I saw my sister with it to day. The second child was born at Clonmell. Edmund Burke was present at the marriage.MR. ALLEY. Q. The marriage was seven years ago - A. Yes. I kept no particular account of the hour of the marriage - I cannot speak to the hour. ALEXANDER BRUCE ESQ . I live in Upper Bedford-place, Russell-square. I know the prisoner. About the latter end of September, 1820, I received a note to meet him at the Crown, Tavern, New-road, Islington; I paid no attention to it, and about the beginning of December, in consequence of another letter, I met him at Gray's-Inn, Coffee-house - I was in his company some time before he mentioned his business; I asked what he sent for me for, he told me he wanted to marry my daughter; he wished my consent, I refused my consent untill I knew who and what he was, and whether he could make an adequate settlement upon her - I never at any subsequent period gave my consent to the marriage, nor did I speak to him for fourteen months after. My daughter's name is Mary Ann Bruce ; (looks at a certificate), I got this from Doctor Strachan, the Vicar of Islington - I examined it with the register, it is a true copy.Q. Since the time stated in the certificate has the prisoner made any application to you - A. No.Cross-examined. Q. He referred you to very respectable people who knew him - A. Never.MISS MARY ANN BRUCE . I was married to the prisoner at Islington church, on the 4th of December, 1820, by licence.(The certificate was here read).Prisoner's Defence. I was made drunk, and entrapped into the first marriage, and never claimed her as my wife. I am, and always was a Protestant. THOMAS MAHER . I live at Munroe, in Tipperary, and rent a farm. I am a Catholic - I know the prisoner; I was his sponsor at his baptism; he was christened by Edward Jordan the parish minister of Tipperary - he is a Protestant minister of the Church of England - he was christened at his uncles, hard by the minister's house; his father was dead, and his mother being at the uncle's, he was christened there - his uncle was a Protestant and so was his father as I hear. I knew him for twelve or thirteen years after the christening continually - he was brought up a Protestant for what I know; I never could see him at mass or at any place - he was once in my company when I was going to mass, and did not go with me, he was then sixteen or seventeen years old; he is now about twenty-eight. He was christened in June, 1794; he was then only two or three days old - I never saw him go to church.MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you ever known any of O'Burke's family - A. I knew them all to be called O'Burke.Q. Have you not seen them at mass - A. I have seen O'Burkes at mass. His mother knew that I was a Catholic.Q. And yet she employed you to stand sponsor for her Protestant child - A. I did; I engaged to take him as it was under my care till he came to maturity, if he had nobody else to do it; but his brother took care of him.COURT. Q. Were you to bring him up a Protestant - A. I do not know what I was bound to do in case any thing happened to his brother. I know Maynooth College, I do not know whether it is a Catholic or Protestant College - I never heard that the prisoners brother was there. I know some of his relations now, some of them go to mass, and his brother Edmund does.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there another Godfather and a Godmother - A. Yes. I know Stapleton the other Godfather, was a Protestant. EDMUND BURKE . I am the prisoner's brother, and live at Springfield, in the County of Tipperary - I am older than him. He was brought up a Protestant. I did not know him up to the time of his marriage with Miss Butler, as he frequently was at school, and I was brought up at home - I was very young when my father died. I had not known much of him for some time before the marriage, as he was apprenticed at Carlow, and went from there to Dublin. I was at Butler's on the day this affair took place.Q. Had you seen your brother before that day - A. I saw him the evening before, I met him in the street - I dined with him at Butler's on this day, we dined after nightfall; it was on the 11th of June, seven years ago. After dinner my brother was neither drunk nor can I say he was sober. James Butler the father of this young woman, said he wished to give him one of his daughters - I do not know which. I forbid Butler to have anything to do with him because he was not a man that was fit, as he was a Protestant.Q. What was done upon that - A. They drank hard and played at cards, and sent for those clergymen, the parish priest, and his coadjutor.Q. How long did they drink before they sent for the priest - A. About three or four hours. Wright the Catholic was the priest. They came, as I suppose, with intent to marry him. They sat down and drank hard, then called him, and asked him to comply with them.Q. To comply with what - A. With the Catholic church, to go to confession I suppose, to become a Catholic; he said he would not; he was not sober. Wright came out and declined marrying him, and said he had nothing to do with him he might go home - I desired him to get up, and come home to his mother's place, which is about fifteen miles off; he stood up to come, and then Butler stood up and said, neither he, nor I, nor the priest should go away, till we parted on good terms and drank more - then they all got as I suppose stupidly drunk.Q. While you were there did you see any ceremony of marriage performed by any body - A. None whatever. I went away between one and two o'clock in the morning; I was drunk then - my brother came out into the street with me; I wanted him to come away with me, but finding him so drunk and unable, he remained there. I did not go to Butler's again for three years.Q. How long did your brother stay at Butler's after this - A. I do not know that he went back to Butler's. I had a letter from him afterwards, and met him at Temple-moore, about a lease, and he said he would go home to Dublin;this was two days after. Temple-moore is about fifteen miles from Cashel - he need not go through Cashel again to go to Dublin. I was never at his house at Dublin afterwards. He was in the grocery, wine, and spirit business I believe.MR. LAW. Q. You are a Catholic - A. Yes. I lived at that time at a place called Girthley-bowl, in the parish of Baracilla, seventeen miles from Cashel.Q. What brought you to Cashel - A. My brother wrote me word that his mare had strayed away from Cashel, and I went to look after her, and met him in the street; he had found her - he did not come to me, he wrote and told me I should find him at a first cousin's house of mine in Cashel - I went and found he had just left there, and found him in the street - I found the mare at Butler's; I went there with him to call for the mare, and was invited in to take something - I did not know that he was residing at Butler's house.Q. I give you notice that there are parties in Court who were present on this occasion; on your oath was not the invitation an invitation to be present at the marriage - A. On my oath it was not, I had no more notion of a marriage than I have of going home in a boat from this place.Q. You had lost sight of your brother for many years before this - A. Yes; I cannot exactly tell how many.Q. Will you swear it was not seven - A. I cannot swear. I was very young when I left the country - I had heard nothing of him whatever till he wrote to say his mare had strayed; nothing else brought us together. My mother was a Catholic; my father died before my brother was born. My mother has always been a Catholic - I was only at Cashel on the evening of the 11th, and remained there the day following till two o'clock in the morning of the 13th, as he got drunk and could not go home.COURT. Q. On what day of the week did you first go there - A. On the 11th, Sunday - that was the night the card-playing took place.MR. LAW. Q. You had no idea of the marriage - A. Not the least. I staid all next day, and did not leave till two o'clock in the morning of the 13th, for I did not get up till twelve, and then fell to drinking and playing at cards.COURT. Q. When they tried to entrap your brother, how came you to leave him with such company - A. I thought if I did not go myself I should be turned out.MR. LAW. Q. I give you notice that you will be contradicted if you deny this; but, on the oath you have taken, did you not give your brother away - A. I did not at any time.Q. Did you not give your brother away in marriage either on the 11th or 12th to Mary Butler - A. Never since the day of his birth. I went to bed at Butler's on the 11th, Sunday night - I got up about ten o'clock on Monday morning, as near as I can guess. I breakfasted with the family.Q. Were you sober at breakfast - A. Just betwixt and between, neither drunk nor sober, sometimes sober and sometimes drunk. I dined with the family, that was about ten o'clock at night. I think - I was not sober at dinner; we breakfasted at ten o'clock in the morning. I eat nothing between ten o'clock in the morning and ten at night, but had plenty to drink. I did not see Doctor Wright before Monday. I have a brother named John.Q. Which of your brothers went to Maynooth College - A. My brother Tom; he is not a Catholic; I do not know whether he did go to College, but if any of my brothers did it must be him, as he was the only one fit to go, as he knew Latin - he is gone to America.Q. You came away from Butler's between one and two o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 13th - A. Yes. I left my brother in the street, he was stupidly drunk, and I told him to go to his cousins.Q. Why not go with him - A. He was drunk, but able to walk. He slept at Butler's on Sunday night.Q. And staid there all day - Yes. Sometimes I went for him to try and get him away, but found him locked up in the room playing at cards with these young ladies; I have lost sight of the prisoner for several years; he was apprenticed to Edward Kennedy , a grocer.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. After your father's death, your mother resided at your uncle's; what was your uncle, a Catholic or Protestant - A. A Catholic - I believe my brothers Dennis and John are Protestants. My eldest brother Tom was a Protestant, and they were brought up by him; Tom was brought up by my father, who was a Protestant. My uncle was my father's brother.Q. In all the time you was in Butler's did you see any marriage ceremony going on whatever - A. No. DENNIS BURKE . I am the prisoner's brother, and am five or six years older than him - my father was dead when he was born; I have known him from his birth, except for three years while he has been in London. He was always a Protestant of the Church of England. I knew him in 1815, he was a Protestant then - I always was a Protestant; John goes to mass, but I think he is a Protestant in principle. I have known the prisoner go to mass, but only out of curiosity - he and I went one Good Friday, eight or nine years ago, in Dublin. My brother Tom was educated at the Revered Mr. Jordan's, who is a minister of the Protestant faith; I never knew him go elsewhere - he was always a Protestant; he was a private tutor for sometime, and then went to Dublin, and was about getting into Trinity College, and some years after he went to America on an adventure. I firmly believe he never was at Maynooth College. I generally went to a Protestant Church, and the prisoner constantly went with me when we lived at the same place. This happened in 1814 and 1815.MR. ALLEY. Q. What way of life were you in - A. I superintended the cellars of Messrs. Delapier, wine merchants to His late Majesty; since that I have been in Price and Co's. service; I now sell wine bottles on commission, and support myself with that and what I have saved in service. I have left Ireland about seven years; I left after his marriage. Until I came to England there were not twelve months passed but what I saw my brother. I suppose I saw him at least six times a year. I came to England three years before him - I did not see him for three years and a half after his marriage. I lived at Dublin for about a month after his marriage, and called on him once or twice - I never saw him at a Catholic chapel there with his wife; I never saw her with him - I lived with my mother when the prisoner was born. I firmly believe my brother Tom never entered Maynooth College;he went to America on an adventure, and was never intended for a priest. I never said to Miss Eliza Butler that he was brought up at Maynooth College, or to any one.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you ever at the College - A. I have passed it; it is within thirteen miles of Dublin. I did not go to see my brother at Dublin for I did not like to live in the house, having heard of this woman. I never slept at the house. JOHN BURKE . I am the prisoner's brother, and am about two years older than him; I knew him till he was about fourteen years old - he was brought up a Protestant; I profess the Catholic Religion. My mother is a Catholic. I never saw the prisoner at mass, but he might go; he always professed the Protestant Religion. I knew him at Dublin in 1814 and 1815, at the time of the marriage; he professed the Protestant Religion.MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you live at Dublin after he was married - A. Yes, for two years nearly; he remained there nearly three years. I visited him at times, and heard that he had a child, and saw one about the house, I cannot say it was his. There was a rumour of her misconduct with an officer.Q. Did you not live in the same house with him in 1815 - A. I believe I did. I heard that the child was sent to her mother to be taken care of when he came to England. I have heard that my brother Tom went to Trinity College. I never said he was educated for a priest at Maynooth College.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know what your brother is in America - A. I understand he is a clergyman of the Establishment. MARTIN MURRAY . I am a clerk out of employ, and live in Charles-street, Mary-le-bone. I have known the prisoner here about four years - I knew him in Ireland for seven years; he professed the Protestant Religion. I was walking with him once, and he went into the church, and wanted me to go with him, but I would not as I was a Catholic. I was not intimate with him here. ELIZA BUTLER . The prisoner's brother was present at the marriage, and took him by the hand and gave him away in marriage to my sister - it was about six o'clock in the afternoon. JULIA BUTLER .

THOMAS GOOK . I am a constable of St. James, Westminster. On the 15th of May, the night his Majesty went to Drury-lane Theatre, I was watching some thieves, and saw the prisoner push into the crowd two or three times; he was dressed in a mixt frock coat, (it was about twenty minutes before ten o'clock); he did not at first excite my suspicion, but soon after Connel communicated something to me, and in a few minutes I saw a man push the prisoner right off the pavement, saying,""D - n you, keep your hand out of my pocket;"" this was two hours before the present transaction. About twenty minutes or half-past eleven o'clock, I saw him again, I had been watching him; I observed him standing three or four yards on the left hand side of a gentleman, who had a watch in his pocket; I saw the seal and ribbon, and the prisoner was looking at it - when the trumpet sounded, and the King coming out of the house, the prisoner shifted to the right of the gentleman, and as the carriage drew near, the prisoner clapped his hands just against the gentleman's ears, and hissed; he then threw his arms round the gentleman who was huzzaing, and made a pull at the watch, but did not succeed in getting it - the carriage came nearly up; he made a second attempt, but did not succeed; then the carriage came close up, and the gentleman took his hat off and held it up huzzaing, and then he succeeded in getting it out - I was about a quarter of a yard from the the prisoner; I said to the gentleman,""You are robbed, follow me,"" he said""No, my guard chain has saved it"" - I secured the prisoner, he made great resistance, and said he was the King's servant. I took him towards Street's public-house, in Bow-street, a mob followed us; I put him in the house, and called out for the gentleman who lost his watch; nobody answered. He got the watch out of the pocket, but never separated it from the person. NOT GUILTY .First Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice Burrough.",notGuilty,none

While I was endeavouring to match the pattern, I saw her snatch the Valentia off a pile, and put it under her gown; she could not have taken it by mistake for the scarfs, as it was much larger than them, and a good distance off.

BRODRICK conducted the prosecution.MR. LUKE GRAVES HANSARD. I am in partnership with Luke and James Hansard ; our premises are in Great Turnstile; there is a yard behind the dwelling-house, and then the printing-office; there are walls on each side of the yard, which connect the printing-office with the dwelling-house; Titchbourne-court runs at the back of the office; Whetstone-park is on the South side of the premises; there is a window looking from the printing-office into both places. The premises belong to the firm, and the dwelling-house also; my father has the sole occupation of it; the lower part is used as a counting-house. The rent is paid by the firm. I was in the counting-house, which is on the second floor of the printing-office, at three o'clock; the clock and barometer were then safe there. JOHN FLOWER . I am servant to Messrs. Hansard. On the evening of the 1st of June, about ten o'clock at night, I went round the premises, and saw that all was safe; the windows looking into the courts were fast; I took the keys into the counting-house, and went out at the door in Titchbourne-court, which was fastened after me.MR.

On Sunday, the 2d of June, I got up about ten minutes past five o'clock; I went out at my door, and about ten minutes after I went out again, and saw the window-shutter had been removed, and rested on the cill; I moved the shutter, looked in, and saw a man walking about the place; there was a lad, about eighteen years old, at the bottom of the court, walking about towards Holborn. I watched him for more than a quarter of an hour; he passed my door towards Whetstone-park; I went in, put on my coat, and followed him, and when I got to the top of the court he was gone. I had not been absent more than two minutes. I saw a man shutting the printing-office windows in Whetstone-park; I said it was very improper that he should be shutting the windows that time in the morning; it was then a few minutes after six o'clock; he said something which I did not understand, and went off westward, towards Queen-street; he had a black coat on, and I believe black trowsers. The prisoner is very much like the man, but I cannot swear to him. There was a tall man close to the window while he was shutting it up; he and I examined the window, and found the shutter shut and one bar up. We had seen the man fasten that bar; we took it down, and found the lines cut and the sash taken out; it stood inside. I went and alarmed Mr. Hansard, and went round the premises with him. The stranger went after the man, and I have not seen him since.MR. LUKE HANSARD . The last witness alarmed me; I searched and missed the barometer and clock.

A boy came after him, and told him to make haste, for there was somebody coming after him; he then hurried on, and kept looking back. We followed him to Crown-court. I went up and asked him if he had the barometer to sell; he said Yes, but he thought I had not money enough to give for it. I then said I thought he had not got it honestly, and asked where he lived, and where he was going with it. He said he would shew me; he went on about fifty yards to an old iron shop in Crown-court, and was going to turn in there. I collared him and said, if that was where he lived, I should take him to, the watch-house. The shop door was open; he resisted, but the other two helped me to secure him. We took him to St. Ann's, watch-house, and while we were waiting for the watch-house keeper to get up, he rushed by and ran off with the barometer. We pursued him, and he threw it away. Fielder picked it up. We took him in Nassau-street, without losing sight of him, and took him back to the watch-house. We then went to look after the boy, and a woman pointed out the clock; it was in a basket, at the corner of Frith-street, in Old Compton-street. I found the maker's name on the barometer, which led me to the prosecutor. He wore a black coat and dark trowsers. I knew him before. WILLIAM GILLON . I was with Bidgood; his account is correct.

(Through an Interpreter.) I have no name but Carder; I am a Mahometan, a native of Bombay; I have been sworn by the forms of that religion; I know the four prisoners. On the 3d of June I saw the two male prisoners and the woman Chimes; I do not exactly know the day - it is about twenty-three days ago. About half-past ten o'clock at night I was in Ann Chimes 's house, which is near the Back-road, St. George in the East; she takes in needle-work. As I was walking in the road, Chimes took my red silk turban off, and ran with it into the prisoner Sapple's room. I followed her into the room; there was a light there; Chimes put it out. All four prisoners were in the room. Collesa took me and threw me on the bed. I knew it was him by his voice; I knew him, and he knew me. Tindle then came up to me, and put his hand into my pocket and took my money out. I knew both their voices; they both came here in the same ship with me. He took coin, value fifteen rupees, one half-crown, six shillings, and three penny-pieces. I am sure he took them away. The women did not touch me. Sapple put the candle out. I took hold of one of the men by the hand, and they directly caught me by the pocket. I hallooed out, and Tindle took a knife and threatened me if I made a noise; and when I found they would not let me out, I took Tindle by the arms and dragged him down stairs into the street. A watchman came, and I gave him into custody. I then gave Sapple and Collosa in charge; but Chimes ran away. They were taken to the watch-house. I am certain that they took my money.Prisoner SAPPLE.

I am a constable; I was at the watch-house on the 3d of June; the two male prisoners and Sapple were brought in a little after ten o'clock; Carder came with them; he spoke broken English, and pointed to the two men, and said they took 2 l. 6 s. 3 d., holding up his fingers. I found nothing on them; no knife was found; I searched them very close. WILLIAM GROVES . I am a watchman. On the 3d of June there was a noise in the street between the prosecutor and the prisoner Chimes. The prosecutor said he had been robbed. I asked Chimes what he was talking about, she said that he said he had been robbed, but it was false. The people who stood by said something; I then went into Sapple's room, and brought the male prisoners down; I did not see either of them with a knife. I went in again, and brought Sapple out of her room. Chimes had gone away before I came down. I put them in the watch-house. No knife was found in the room. The house is in Cornwall-street, St. George in the East.COURT to CARDER. Q. How do you know that Tindle had a knife - A. He had it in his jacket pocket; it was such a knife as sailors use. I took hold of his arm, and could feel that he had it.CHIMES'S Defence. I can prove he gave me the turban to take care of, and in five minutes he asked me for it again. I gave it him, and afterwards went to Sapple's room. He came up, and beat these men about dreadfully. They did nothing to him. Sapple called for assistance, and the landlord came up and turned him out, and he said he was robbed of 3 l.; he said I had better go home, for he would have all three that night.TINDLE'S Defence. I was in the room; he followed Collosa up, and struck me; he endeavoured to get from him; he was very much in liquor, and said he was robbed. I had pawned my jacket a few days before to lend him money, and how could he have all this money? WILLIAM SUMMERS . Carder was perfectly sober. CHARLOTTE DUANER . I am landlady of the house. This man came into Sapple's room; I had heard her go up ten minutes before. I heard a noise; went to the bottom of the stairs, and said I would have no piece of work. She said a man had come up, and she could not get him down. Shortly after I went up myself, and told him to go down stairs, for I would have no fighting there. Sapple said he wanted to fight the other man; he came into the passage, and waited there; I suppose he wanted the other man to come down, but I could not understand what he said. I had heard Sapple crying out to take him down, or he would commit murder. He never said he was robbed till he got out of doors. I went up to Sapple's room after he was gone to the watch-house, and blew her candle out. ESTHER TRAMING .

I was at the top of Bluecoat-fields with Chimes. Carder came up, and asked if she would have anything to drink; she said Yes, if he gave her sister some.

Pepper and my husband went out before me - I left nobody in the apartments; I locked the door. When I opened it the lock did not appear injured - somebody must have used a false key to get in - I had left a gown on the bed; I was not the first that went in - Pepper's gown hung on a nail when I went out; and the petticoat was on the bed. CATHERINE PEPPER . I left the apartments at half-past ten o'clock. Mr. Winder was gone before me; I went to see the procession, and returned about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, and found the door locked; I saw nobody there; I had left my gown hanging on a nail, and the petticoat on the bed. I went to the Swan, public-house, in Coleman-street, to wait till my aunt returned, and in about ten minutes I returned to the house again - I had two friends whom I left at the bottom of the court; I went up stairs, and saw the prisoner just coming out of the room door, with his foot on the first step; the door was ajar, I did not see anything in his possession; he walked by me. There is no higher stairs in the house, nor any other room door on that floor. I went forward to the door to see if my aunt was come, and was much alarmed - the gowns were thrown behind the door; mine had been moved some distance from where I hung it. Mrs. Windser's gown was also there; my gown was not much worn. I called Stop thief! but he got away - I pursued him; I lost sight of him after he got out of the house, but saw him three or four minutes after in custody of Read. I am sure he is the same man I saw coming out of the door.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is the staircase light or dark - A. Dark, There was light enough for me to see his face. I am sure of his person. JOHN READ . I took the prisoner in Great Bell-alley. I was with Pepper, and was waiting with my mother at the corner of the court - I saw him come out of the house, and heard the cry; he ran by me - I caught him without losing sight of him. He was searched in my presence, and a large bag was found in his hat, and three keys wrapped up in rags separate, and more keys were found in his waistcoat pocket - I took him back to the room; he was searched there - two gowns laid on the floor with a petticoat all rolled up together. ROBERT FIELDING . I am a constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and found the prisoner in Read's custody; I took him back to the room, and found three door keys in a bag in his hat, and three door keys wrapped up separately in rags; I found five other keys in his waistcoat pocket, two of which will open Windser's door.MRS. WINDSER. My husband had not come home when I returned.(Property produced and sworn to.)Prisoner's Defence. I was going about a job, and met a woman in Moorfields, whose nephew I knew; she said she heard he lived up the first court on the right-hand side of Coleman-street; I walked fast, a young man came and asked if I had dropped a bag and keys; he said they were of no use to him - I thought I might as well have them; I then went to the top of this house, found the door open, and on coming down met this woman; she called me, and I walked back myself.GUILTY.

Only three pieces were shewn to them, and there was no more within their reach. The officer searched them - I was not present then; the officer afterwards produced six yards of lace, which had our shop mark on it, and was one of the pieces which had been shewn them,Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. They staid in the shop half an hour, though they knew it was missed - A. Yes. It was not on a card; I thought it might have stuck on their clothes, and looked, and am certain it had not; the officer brought it in from the street. Dart offered to be searched before the officer came. WILLIAM HENRY HILL . I am a constable. I was sent for, and searched them, but found nothing; I searched Dart and Douglas more particularly than Collins. No conversation passed between them. I was in the room for quarter of an hour. It could not have been on any part of the outside of their clothes. I fetched Brown, who examined their shoes, but found nothing. We took them to the watch-house, that they might be searched by a female. I took hold of Collins, and kept her out of the regular pathway, to avoid the crowd.

I had left it close down the night before, and fastened it with a screw in the middle. I do not know how they could get it open; it was done by somebody outside; the glass was not taken out; there were footmarks under the window outside; they must have got in that way, but how they unscrewed the door I cannot tell. I had left some halfpence and penny-pieces in the till; I do not know the amount; they were gone, and nearly a gallon of brandy was gone out of the bar, out of a small cask.

We went to the Rose and Crown public-house, and then to Mr. Atkins's the butcher, and got two pounds of beefsteaks: we then went to the Rose and Crown, and had the steaks and eggs cooked. I asked him where he got them; he said he bought them of Mr. Fleming, the grocer, and that he took the money from Mr. Upton, where he had been at work; he is a coal merchant; he worked there three or four days; he asked me to give him 1 s. in silver for halfpence, which I did; another man also gave him 1 s. for halfpence; he then went to the landlord, (Parker) and got 3 s. for halfpence - and afterwards six more shillings; I was in custody three days for this; I paid my part towards the steaks, having 6 s. of my own. On the Friday night he asked me to go with him to rob Mr. Elworth's house.Q. How came he to propose that to you - A. I do not know - I did not go - I was intimate with him; we slept in the same loft.

I went back to the staircase, and she returned with her pail. I missed her for some time; I could not see her for five minutes. I heard a rustling like jeans being unfolded; I went down to the back room door, and saw her at the first drawer in the foreman's room; I went in as she was shutting the drawer - I asked what she was doing; she said merely putting in some pieces of jean which laid about. I said there were none laying about a few minutes before, for I had been down there, and that she had no business at the drawer.

I said there was an officer down stairs ready to take her, and left her (there was no officer) - she finished her work, and in the intermediate time Mr. Gould sent for our foreman to examine the drawers. I, Mr. Gould, and the foreman, went in to examine them. I found two pieces of jean in the drawer I saw her at; they measured four yards and a half each; I do not know where they were before.

JOSEPH READ . I am a carpenter, and live at Pentonville. On the 16th of June, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, I was in Drury-lane, at the end of Wellington-place, nearly opposite the Theatre. I was going to Chancery-lane, and at the corner of Wellington-place, as I passed by, the prisoner Capps seized me by the waistcoat; the other two prisoners were up the passage, standing about two yards behind her; she forced her other hand into my right-hand waistcoat pocket, and took out one half-crown, one shilling, and a sixpence. When she collared me she pulled me off the pavement into Wellington-place foreibly, and at that moment Smith hit me in the eye with her fist; this was at the very time that Capps put her hand into my pocket. I cannot swear to Carroll. The blow knocked me down. I was not in liquor. When I rose I saw Nicholls, and ordered him to fetch a constable. Scott came. I knew neither of the prisoners before; I had not spoken to them, nor they to me. I seized Capps as soon as I got up, and held her till Scott came - I gave her in his charge.Prisoner Capps. Q.

I took the other two about twenty minutes after, the fighting was over when I got there. He said in Capps's presence that he was robbed of 4 s., a half-crown, and 6 d.; she denied having any money, but at the watch-house I found half-a-crown in her hand; she threw it down on the bench when I was going to search her. The prosecutor was very much smeared with blood, which came from his nose; he had a black eye, and his head was beat; he did not appear the least tipsy. I saw Carroll and Smith round there when I went up. BENJAMIN SMITH . I live in White Hart-yard; I assisted in getting the prosecutor from the women. Capps was holding him by the collar, pulling him about; he was all over blood. NATILAN NATHAN . I live near Wellington-court. OnSunday morning, the 16th of June, I stood at my door, and saw Read come down towards the court, and another girl, (neither of the prisoners) had laid hold of him by the arm; and as he walked by the court she shoved him up the court. Capps who stood under the archway immediately came up, and put her hand in his waistcoat pocket; I did not see her touch him before that. The prosecutor said,""I will not be robbed, and will not let you go;"" he held her by the hand. While he was wrestling with her, the other two prisoners came down the court towards him; one of them cried,""Let her go;"" he said he would not; and one of them said,""If you do not, we will knock your b - y head off."" The other two came up after her hand was in his pocket. SAMUEL ROBSON . I was standing at my house in Drury-lane, and, hearing a noise, went out; I saw the prosecutor dragged out of the court, all streaming in blood - he had hold of Capps, and said,""You shall not go till I get my money. I saw the other prisoners there."" JOSEPH READ re-examined. I saw no woman till I saw Capps, that I recollect - one might be walking by my side, but Capps stood at the entrance of the passage, and fixed on me. I was knocked down so immediately, that I hardly knew what was done at first. Capps's hand was in my pocket at the time Smith gave me the blow.CAPPS'S Defence. I was coming down the court - this man was coming down with another female; he took my cap off, and put it in his pocket, struck me, and asked me for drink - I had half-a-crown in my hand - the other woman went away; and when I refused to give him drink, he said I had robbed him of 4 s. These women seeing him ill-use me, came up, and he struck them.SMITH's Defence.

While I was pursuing Kerns, I saw him throw a handkerchief into the ditch; I stopped to take it up, or I should have had him then - I produce it. I found Marsh afterwards at Mr. Thomas's house - I found nothing on him. Kerns denied that the handkerchief was his. I am sure of both of them; I was close to all three, and saw their faces. I think the salts worth 20 s. each, the dessert spoons 5 s. each, and the table spoons 30 s. - they are not found. The tea spoons are worth 5 s. each. JAMES PICKETT . I work at the nursery-ground. After Kerns was taken, I walked round the nursery, and found Marsh laying on the side of the hedge concealed. I took him to Mr. Thomas's house, and gave him to Wilson.Prisoner MARSH. Q. Was I not asleep - A. No. I asked what he laid there for; he said he was very tired. Kerns had been taken half an hour before.(Property produced and sworn to.)KERNS's Defence. Being short of work, I went to the New River to wash; I walked across the field into the road, got over a gate, and laid down in an oat field, and was taken by these men, who asked where the clothes were which I had stolen, and forty or fifty yards off some of the plate was found.MARSH'S Defence. I went to seek for work in the country, and about two o'clock, finding myself tired and dirty, I went to the river to wash; I afterwards heard the cry, and ran across the field, as any one else would; I got over into the garden and went to sleep.KERNS - GUILTY - DEATH .

ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution. THOMAS MITCHELL . I am a linen-draper, and live in Leadenhall-street. The prisoner was more than fourteen years in my employment; he left early in March 1820, to go into business on his own account; he took a shop in Bethnal-green Road. I gave him credit to the amount of 400 l. or 500 l. On the 3d of June last, I received information, and on the 4th I went to his shop in Bethnal-green Road; before I entered, I saw some lawns in the window, which I knew to be mine. I then went in with Mr. Thomas and Mr. Hines; the prisoner was out, he was sent for, and came in a few minutes. I told him I wished to see the lawns which were in his window; he brought part of them; I told him they were my property, and had never been sold to him, and I had reason to believe there was a considerable quantity more goods, and I insisted on seeing them; I said he knew what belonged to me, and I expected him to produce them; this passed in a little back room adjoining the shop. I went into the shop myself, looked about, and desired him to take down some Irish linens, muslins, and a paper containing India muslins, and some shawls; these were taken down, and I claimed them from private marks by which I knew them; I said he must have taken them while he was in my employ, and I had never sold them; there was a considerable quantity of them placed together; he made no answer how he got them; he was so confused, that I thought he was incapable. All the articles stated in the indictment were found there on that day, except the diaper, but that is not a tenth part of what was found; I am positive I never sold them to him; I have since asked him how he came possessed of them, he made no answer. I have never held out any hopes or promises to him; the goods I claimed were put up in a wrapper, and afterwards, by his written permission, removed to my house; the value in the indictment is something below their real value. I told him my debt was twice the amount of any person's, and therefore I insisted on having a warrant of attorney for 300 l., as he owed me 400 l.; I said I should then stand equal with the rest of the creditors. I got the warrant on the 5th, and took out the execution next day. I then informed the creditors, and gave up my warrant to distribute the effects equally - I only took it out to secure the goods.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you not obtained from him since, an assignment of all his book debts and property of every description, to the amount of nearly 1500 l. - A. It is under 1000 l.; the assignment was for the benefit of all his creditors - I never promised to take no steps against him, if he made this assignment. I did not promise not to put the warrant of attorney in force for six months. I had him apprehended about a month after the assignment.Q. Why not proceed instantly against him - A. It was partly my own convenience, and a wish to obtain the goods. We had a consultation whether we should take him this Session or the next; he was taken the night before last. I have had intercourse with him, from time to time; he has applied to me about it - I said I had nothing to say to him at present. No promise of any kind was held out to him - I did not object to an attorney attending on his behalf.Q. Do none of the goods you sell go out with your mark - A. Certainly.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you the only person named in the assignment - A. No. Mr. Stockdale, the next principal creditor; it is for the benefit of all the creditors. THOMAS OLDHAM . I was once in the service of the prosecutor, and about two months ago I went to assist the prisoner in his business, and noticed a great number of goods that were Mr. Mitchell's, and mentioned it to Lewis: they had Mitchell's mark on them.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long did you live with Mr. Mitchell - A. Three or four years, and while the prisoner lived there, I was clerk; he knew I was acquainted with the goods - but cannot say whether he knew I was acquainted with the mark. The goods were exposed.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had you left Mr. Mitchell - A. Three or four years. I have examined all the prisoner's invoices; none of these goods are included in them. THOMAS HIND . I was in Mr. Mitchell's employ about twelve months ago, and am now in business for myself; on the 4th of June, I accompanied him to the prisoner's shop, and saw the goods brought out of the window; they had Mr. Mitchell's mark on them; and other goods were found with the mark on them; he was asked to produce invoices of them, and could not. I produce the invoices delivered to him, with goods sold him; Mr. Mitchell delivered them to me.MR. MITCHELL. These came in my possession under the assignment; they are all the bills of those he bought of me. THOMAS HIND . (In continuation.) When the first parcel was found, he was asked to produce his invoices; he brought invoices, and they contained none of these goods; the prisoner called a few days after at my house, and requested me to wait on Mr. Mitchell, to intercede for his forgiveness, and not to prosecute him; I told him I could not think of that, but I did at last, and afterwards saw him, and told him the prosecutor would make no promises. He asked my advice - I advised him to give up all the goods which he had fraudulently obtained, as without that he could not expect clemency; he said, he did not know what he should do; he should be ruined, and what would become of his wife and family; this conversation was about a week after the 4th of June; he called on me repeatedly about my interceding with Mr. Mitchell.Cross-examined. Q. You told him nothing could be done unless he gave up the goods - A. No. Mr. Mitchell never said he would not prosecute him if he got all the goods. PHILLIP LEWIS . I am a linen draper, and live in Bethnal-green Road; I was in the prisoner's employ, his goods were kept in the shop, and some up stairs in an Irish case in his bed room; most of the property claimed by the prosecutor was in that case. I had seen the case before the prisoner took the shop at No. 4, Princes-street, Finsbury, where he lodged - I did not see the contents until about nine months after he opened the shop in Bethnal-green Road.(Property produced and sworn to).The prisoner put in a written Defence, - stating, that all the goods were invoiced to him; that the warrant of attorney was obtained on a promise that it should not be executed for six months; and that his own private mark was the same as Mr. Mitchell's. PHILLIP LEWIS . I was the prisoner's shop boy; one of his marks are the same as Mr. Mitchell's; but Mr. Mitchell has two marks. I lived with the prisoner from his first commencement in business, (examining the goods) the marks on these are not the hand-writing of the prisoner or myself.MR. MITCHELL. I have examined all the marks; most of the goods have two marks, one mine, and the other my shopman's. The prisoner's writing is not on one of these, where the marks are visible. THOMAS HIND . I cannot find the prisoner's writing on any of them. Part of them bear both the marks of myself and Mr. Mitchell. GUILTY . Aged 38.Recommended to Mercy.

Bank notes, the property of Roger Robinson , from the person of Alice, his wife . ALICE ROBINSON . I am the wife of Roger Robinson , who is a mariner; I went with him on the 2d of July, to Somerset-house, to receive some money; I had before this, two 5 l. Bank notes in my pocket-book; a person spoke to my husband by St. Dunstan's Church, about two o'clock, and he took us into the back room of the Falcon, Fetter-lane, to get directions about a ship for my husband, and in about ten minutes the prisoner came in. Myself and my husband, and two other men besides the prisoner, were in the room; there was only one man there when I first went in; the prisoner asked if I had seen a young woman whom he described; I said no; he then said he was a country farmer just come from Wales, and had received 1100 l. at the Bank the day before; he pulled out some guineas and Bank notes, to shew that he had money; he dropped one note, and one of the two men picked it up, and said it was a 5 l. note; he gave it to the prisoner; we told him he should be careful of his money, and not throw it about. Then the man who took us there offered to play a game with the prisoner with three chalks, and putting halfpence under a pot, they asked my husband to put his hand on the top of the pot, which he did, and then he lifted it up; the other man who took us there called heads or tails, and he won a sovereign of the prisoner; he put the sovereign on his finger, and said he would treat the company with it, either with wine or brandy and water, (the landlord had brought a pen and ink before the gambling began, for the man to write the directions of the ship.) The man played another game with the prisoner for another sovereign, and won again - he offered to return all he had won, as he said, he did not wish to keep it, as he might as well have won 20 l. as 2 l.; the prisoner began to abuse us all, and said we were all poor people, and had no money, and meant to rob him, and that he had plenty of money, if we had none. I took out my pocket-book to put in the direction the man had given me; I took the two 5 l. notes out to put it in, and my husband said.""Let him see that we are not poor, and do not want to rob him;"" the other man snatched the two 5 l. notes out of my hand, and put them into the prisoner's hat, and the prisoner put them into his pocket. My husband collared the other man, and told me to take care of the prisoner - saying, they were all aset of swindlers; the prisoner went out of the room, and I after him, and just as we got out of the public-house, he put two 5 l. notes into my hand; my notes were quite clean and new, without any writing on them whatever; one of those he gave me, I think was my own; but the other had writing on it, and I was fearful it was bad, and had him detained; it afterwards proved to be a good one. I gave him over to the beadle. I stopped him in the passage before he got out; he gave me no reason for running away with them. One of the other persons ran away, and the one my husband collared got away; the prisoner was taken into a grocer's shop, and immediately began to tear up some papers, which I thought were notes. After we had been to Guildhall, he said he hoped we would not hurt him, and what did I want more than my money? I said I did not want more; he said he hoped I would not be hard with him.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Some money was taken from him in the grocer's shop - A. Yes. I cannot say how much. The prisoner laid no money on the table; he put it all in his pocket. The man snatched the notes from my hand - I never put them on the table; only us five were in the room.Q. Did he not say, I do not want your notes, here they are - A. No. ROGER ROBINSON . On Tuesday last, I and my wife were together; we met a man who took us to the Falcon public-house about getting a ship; the man went into the public-house with us. There was another man in the room; and in about ten minutes the prisoner came in and called for a pint of beer, and enquired after a woman, who he said he had given 10 l. to, and said he was a farmer come from Wales - that he had been to the Bank and received 1100 l. He began to flash his money about - he had gold and sovereigns. A note dropped out, and the man who gave me the direction picked it up, and said he should be careful of it, and gave it him, saying it was a 5 l. note; the prisoner pulled his gold out again, and began to grumble with the man. I laid my hand on the pot, as they asked me; they made three chalks, and covered it with a pot, and put a halfpenny under it. I did not bet with them; the prisoner lost a sovereign; the man gave it him again, and told him to be more careful of his money. The prisoner then said we were all a set of beggars and wished to rob him. My wife took up the direction and put it in her pocket-book; she took out the notes; I said,""Let them see the notes, that we are not poor, nor mean to rob them."" The man who gave me the direction snatched them out of her hand, and put them into the prisoner's hat; the prisoner immediately took them, and was putting them in his pocket; I jumped up and seized the man, and told my wife to take care of the prisoner, who was going out of the room - she got into the passage, he gave my wife the two notes; the man who was in the room started off, the other men was at the street door with me, I let go of him to secure the prisoner, I shoved him into a shop, and then that man came up to strike me; I should know him again if I saw him; my wife fetched a constable while I held the prisoner. Our notes were new, and quite clean; the prisoner gave her one that was endorsed, the other appeared to be my own.Cross-examined. Q. You proposed to shew the notes - A. Yes. She did not put them on the table.Q. When he went to the door, was it not to call the landlord - A. No. He said,""You have got your money, why not let me go about my business;"" he had no money in his hat before the man threw my notes in; he had got to the threshold of the street door when I laid hold of him. JAMES HOGAN . I am a painter and glazier. I was going to dinner, and saw the prosecutor and his wife hurrying the prisoner into a grocer's shop; they said he he had taken two 5 l. Bank notes from the wife; he said, They had got their money, and thought that was quite sufficient, and hoped they would do no more; the constable searched them, and the prisoner took out some papers like Bank notes, and attempted to destroy them, but was prevented; but he succeeded in tearing some of them. I saw the duplicate of a watch and four seals found on him; also, ten guineas, a sovereign, a foreign coin, a ten-pound note, and two five-pound notes. THOMAS SMITH . I am the street keeper. I took charge of him; I was going to search him - I found a 10 l. Bank note, two 5 l. notes, ten guineas, and a foreign gold coin and a sovereign, and some papers. One was a shilling note, and three or four flash notes. The money found on him was returned to him.Prisoner's Defence. I declare to God, that they betted their money as fair as any man. GUILTY .

MARY ANN WARD . I am the wife of William Ward , who is a wool-comber , and lives at Sloane-street. On the 3d of July, about half-past ten or a quarter to eleven o'clock at night, I was in Hyde-park, just by the milk-house; I was going to meet my husband. We had comeout of Leicestershire about a month before; he was living at his father's, and I at mine, in York-street, Westminster. I was to meet him in the park by appointment; he was going into the Infirmary. I was never in the park before of a night, but was there once in the day-time. He came to meet me, as my father and he had had words, and he did not like to come there; we were to meet a little before eleven o'clock. As I was walking along, a man dressed like a soldier, and the prisoner, came out from under some trees; the prisoner had a dark frock on; they both took hold of me, and said nothing, but dragged me under the trees; I cried out Murder! as loud as I could several times. They stopped me about four yards from the trees. Neither of them said anything; but when they got me under the trees, the soldier robbed me of the shawl off my neck, and cut my pocket from my side; there was nothing but a small pen-knife and a key in it. The soldier then said to the prisoner,""We are two comrades;"" and the prisoner said to him,""You be off,"" and the soldier immediately ran away across the park, and the prisoner went about twenty yards from me and changed his dress; he put on a white smock-frock. I continued making an alarm, and two gentlemen came up and took him, while he was putting his arm into the frock. I was laying on the ground and could not get up, they hurt me so; they dragged me on the ground; they had pulled me down. The prisoner used me worse than the soldier, by dragging me about, which hurt my side very much; and when the gentlemen held me up I fell down again, from the hurt I received and the fright together; they said nothing to me; I had never seen either of them before. My bonnet came off with their dragging me. The prisoner's other dress laid on the ground; he tried to take it up, when the gentlemen came up and secured him. I am sure he is the man. He took nothing from me, but the soldier did; here is the gown I had on at the time (producing it); it is torn, and all green with the grass. JOHN HOWLETT . I live at No. 2, Adam-street. I was coming through the Park, just by the new monument, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock, and heard a woman scream Murder! several times; the voice came from under some trees near the milk-house. I was alarmed, and did not like to go alone; but a gentleman came up soon after, and ran with me; I got up to the woman first, and did not see any more of the gentleman. Just as I was making up to her, she was coming out of the grove of trees, with her hair all down, and her bonnet in her hand, and said she had been robbed by a soldier and another man. I looked round and saw a man in white, about ten yards from her; I thought it was a woman, and said,""What woman is that with you;"" she said it was a man. I went up to him (it was the prisoner), and asked why he did not help the woman while she was crying out murder; he said it was nothing to him, but her calling out murder had caused him to lose his money. Directly she came up she said he was one of the men who had robbed her; he had not got his frock completely on, and had a loose bundle laying before him; he took it up loose as it was, and ran towards Piccadilly gate. I and the prosecutrix ran after him, and Dawson met him and secured him. The woman was not able to run, so I took her by the hand. FREDERICK DAWSON . I was in the park; I heard the woman cry out Murder! and saw the prisoner running, and these two running after him. I ran across and secured him. I brought him into Piccadilly. Howlett and the prosecutrix came up, and she said that was the man who helped to rob her.JOHN WORMWOOD. I am constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house. The soldier cannot be found. The prisoner's bundle was brought to the watch-house; it is a black smockfrock and two soldier's jackets. I do not know that he is a soldier.Prisoner's Defence. On Wednesday evening I was enquiring for a lodging about a quarter past nine o'clock. I bought this new frock and jacket, having had money given me to go into the country. I had a 1 l. note from the Royal Hotel. I inquired for lodgings about Westminster, and the last place I enquired at was about forty yards from the Park; and as I could get none, and thinking that if I travelled on the road with the bundle I might be stopped for stealing it, I determined to sleep in the Park, and took off my frock, and in came a young woman (the prosecutrix) arm-in-arm with a soldier. They looked at me, and I did not wonder at it, as it might look suspicious to see me changing my clothes. Directly after I saw her sitting down with a stout man; she directly called out Master, master! and I thought to myself, if I go to assist her, I shall get abused and insulted, and perhaps robbed of my clothes. Well, he kept scrambling with her for five minutes, then got up, and came by me swearing, and she calling after him; he had a brown coat and light breeches on, and appeared a smith, or something of the kind. Directly after that, a soldier came up and asked what was the matter, and she told him her case; he spoke kindly to her, and asked her all about it. He laid down by her for two or three minutes; they then got up and came near me, and looked at me; then the soldier said,""Ah! Yorkshire, what country."" I said I did not know what country I came from. The prosecutrix had hold of his hand, and she had something in her hand - he was taking it from her. She said,""It is mine"" - and he said it was his. She said,""Why don't you take my part;"" I said,""What do I know about it - how am I to know which is right."" Well, he went behind her, took her under the arms, and dragged her round, but did not hurt her; he then took her bonnet, and set off; she said to me,""You are no man, or you would take a woman's part;"" I said I should get into trouble if I did - I was sorry to see her ill-treated, but he was a man of more strength than me. Well, she grumbled at me and went on. I took up my things and went a few yards into the trees; she followed up to me. This young man came up, and she told him I would not take her part; then another man came up, and two or three more; they began to search me, and I said I should lose my money. Then they said,""Where is the woman's handkerchief or shawl?"" They began to hawl my things over, and took hold of me. I said,""Let us go to the light."" A sergeant came, and the girl said,""Here is a deserter - here is his jacket and waistcoat."" Well, they determined to take me before a watchman, and met one, who said he would have nothing to do in it. They took me to the same public-house where I had enquired for a lodging, and the landlord and landlady both said I had been there about a lodging. I told themto search me there - they would not. At last they met another watchman, who took me in charge. The young man threatened me, and said,""You bl - y rogue, I will pay you;"" I said I had injured nobody, and the innocent had nothing to fear. Well, they took me to a watch-house; several people bolted in after me - they laid very heavy charges against me, and called me a Methodist, and things of that sort. The beadle searched me at the watch-house, and found nothing on me but my money, which they counted before me, and said if I spoke a word they would strike and beat me. They locked me down stairs without a drop of water, and when the girl came to have her trial, she had another gown on.JURY to MARY ANN WARD . Q. How came you to lay on the ground without being able to stand, and the witness says you came towards him - A. I fell down when he lifted me up. JOHN HOWLETT re-examined. She was walking towards me very slowly, and I caught hold of her hand. I did not see her on the ground at all; she fell down once, and I took her up immediately to follow the man, and we went on together - I holding her arm; she appeared weak and faint. JAMES COLEHAM , of Charter-house-street, Charter-house-square, gave the prisoner a good character; he had not known him for the last two years, but at that time he was of a weak intellect.

Then the prisoner said,""Let us have six-penny worth of rum and water."" Lowick was going to sleep - the prisoner held the rum and water to his mouth, and put some into his mouth, and the rest ran down his bosom, but he fell asleep directly. I then saw the prisoner put his right hand into Lowick's right-hand pocket, and turn all his money out, and put it on the table; he was going to count it, but seeing me look at him, he put it all into his own right-hand pocket, and kept asking Lowick to drink more; but he was so stupified, he could not answer him. I then saw him take his watch; he was going to put it in his own pocket, but I said,""Stop, that is not yours - you have robbed the man of his money before."" I called the landlord, and wanted him to give the landlord the money and watch to keep for the prosecutor; he said I was a liar, and struck at me two or three times; he gave the watch to the landlord, but denied having the money. I sent for an officer. Betts came, and asked him what money he had in his pocket when he came from home; he said 7 s. or 7 s. 6 d., not more; and if he had more, it was not his.

I am a labourer in the East India Company's service, at the tea warehouse in Cutler-street. On Saturday, the 18th of May, the prisoner came to the warehouse, and presented me a permit for four chests of tea, one of which was No. 8720 - he said he came from Mr. Goodey for a chest of tea, that he was his porter, and this one chest was wanted immediately to go into the country by a waggon, and that the carman was gone to the Docks, and would call for the other three on his return; I believed this account and delivered it to him; he took it away on his head. This was about half-past two o'clock. Goodey's carman called a quarter of an hour after, and wanted four chests; I told him one was delivered to their porter. I had told the prisoner to take the permit with him, to prevent its being seized - he said his order was to leave it with me. On Monday I saw him in custody. I am certain of his person.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not know Mr. Goodey - A. No. I should not have delivered it unless he had produced the permit. I knew Goodey by name. The permit is obtained at the Permit-office. There is never any other document brought to me. JAMES HONOUR . I am a labourer in the East India Company's service. The prisoner brought the permit to Walker. I helped the chest of tea on his knot; he went away with it. GEORGE PERKINS . I am porter to Mr. George Goodey , who lives in the Borough. I know the prisoner; he was never employed by Mr. Goodey. I saw him on the 18th of May, about a quarter before three o'clock, in Fenchurch-street, with one chest, as I was going to fetch four chests; I knew him before that; I said nothing to him, but went to the warehouse for a request note to go to the Excise-office for a permit for four chests of tea, and could not find the request note in the box - I was going out of the yard, and Walker called to me; I found he had the permit, and, in consequence of what he told me, I informed my master.MR. JOHN GOODEY . I am the nephew of George Goodey .I have known the prisoner about six months; he was never in our employ. I assist in the business. My uncle bought four chests of tea; I never gave the prisoner orders to get this tea, nor did I give him the permit. Any man might get a request note for permits - I had no intention of sending one of the chests into the country. I saw the prisoner about twelve o'clock on Saturday night, in a state of intoxication. He was taken about nine o'clock on Sunday morning; I told him what he was taken for; he said he knew nothing about it; that he did not know what I was talking of - he resisted. He afterwards said he had lodged it with John Searl , in the Borough-market. I have not found it; it is worth 23 l. Searl and Byfield were apprehended in consequence of what he said.Cross-examined. Q. What is he - A. A porter in the Borough-market - I never saw him at work. I saw him at twelve o'clock at night drunk; I went to the watch-house, and on returning he was gone. He did not say he was employed by Searl and Byfield to get it.MR. GEORGE GOODEY . I am a tea-dealer in the Borough. I had bought four chests of tea. I never gave the prisoner orders to apply for them - he was unknown to me. I did not intend to send any of them into the country. I sent the carman for it; he only brought three chests.MR. PHILLIPS addressed the Jury on behalf of the prisoner, stating that his account was that a person sent him with the permit, and he was to lodge the tea at Searl's house.JURY to WALKER. Q.

LAW conducted the prosecution. WILLIAM COPE . I am in partnership with James Morrison ; we are haberdashers, and live in Oxford-street. The prisoner was in our service as hosier; the business was very frequently under his controul; it is carried on under the firm of Todd and Co. On Monday, the 17th of June, I made a communication to Plank the officer, at Marlborough-street - and on Thursday morning the prisoner delivered an anonymous note into my hand - (looks at it) this is it, and the envelope; he said he had it from the cook - I told him he had been robbing me.(Letter read.)To Mr. MEREDITH.""Sir, You are suspected of having robbed Messrs. Todd - the writer overheard a conversation between Mr. Todd and one of the Officers of Marlborough-street. One of the housemaids is also implicated.""This letter was enclosed in an envelope, and directed""For the Cook.""Mr. COPE. The cook is in the shop in the day-time, and sleeps in Castle-street; he said it came from Castle-street, from the area. I told him I was informed he was robbing me - and had appointed two men to come that day and the next with marked money, and I was sorry he had found it out so soon; but as he had I must send for an officer. I sent for Plank, and kept the prisoner in my presence. Plank searched his drawer and trunks - which we opened with his own key; and immediately that it opened, the prisoner took up two parcels and gave them to me - I was going to open them. One contained a piece of ribbon directed to Humphries; he said he had taken that himself down to his sister, that it would not do, and he brought it back; there was a paper inside it with a bill of parcels of his own making. When goods are sent from our house, the bill is made out by one person and examined by a second, and signed with his initials, and the date put to it. The other parcel contained six fans; he said he meant to take them to his sister, for he thought they would suit her trade. I asked if they were entered anywhere, and if any person besides himselfknew it? he said No - they were wrapt in separate papers; there was a paper with writing on it in the ribbon parcel, which appeared to be his own writing.Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Todd and Co. carry on very extensive business in the City - A. Yes. Mr. Todd has no concern with the house in Oxford-street. I have heard since this, that the prisoner's sister keeps a small shop at Walton on Thames - and he told me three or four weeks before, that a parcel was for his sister at Walton. I did not find fault with him for selling her goods. I often send goods on approbation in town, but not in the country.Q. Do you know Mr. Middleton of Tunbridge-wells - A. I understand he is a customer of mine - I received an order from him last week; it was addressed to Meredith. I ordered the goods to be sent.Q. The prisoner could have taken the things out of his box before he brought you the letter - A. Certainly. I have a boy named Wiggins, who has a relation at Walton; the prisoner asked leave for him to go to Walton one Sunday. The prisoner said the ribbon was sent to his sister for a club, but not being the colour, he brought it back himself, and had forgotten to put it back.MR. LAW. Q. What was the parcel which you knew went to his sister - A. Four parasols. All goods which go out should be entered by the clerk. SAMUEL PLANK . I am an officer. Mr. Cope made a communication to me, and on the 20th of June I was sent for - and as I opened the prisoner's box he put his hand in and took out two parcels, and delivered them to Mr. Cope. I opened them - one contained ribbon, and the other four fans; the ribbon was directed to""Mr. Humphries's cottage, Walton;"" a bill of parcels was in it, and a note; he said he took the ribbon to the person to whom it was directed - they did not approve of it, and he brought it back - it was wafered; he said he took the fans, intending to shew them to some person on the following Sunday.(Note read.)""I could not get one with an edge - but can get one text week, if you have any one to call for it."" WILLIAM WIGGINS . My parents live at Walton; I dined there on Whit-Sunday. On the 26th of May, I brought one parcel from the prisoner's sister; it contained Norwich crape - her name is Humphries. I had strict orders to keep it from Mr. Cope, or any of the young men; but to return it to him as a secret. I gave it to him on Sunday evening, and told him next day in the shop, that it was spotted, and therefore returned. I have brought nothing else from his sister's.Prisoner's Defence. The ribbon was returned; I did not say I brought it back myself. I meant to take the fans down on Sunday. Mr. Cope was well aware of my sending goods to my sister. ROBERT PARKINS . I am butler to Mr. Middleton of Tunbridge-wells; they have dealt with the prosecutor two or three times through the prisoner. JANE RAMSAY . I am cook to the prosecutor.

When we got to Kingsland-crescent, I thought I felt her hand going inside my coat pocket, and charged her with it, but she denied it. I did not push her away when she spoke to me - for I was afraid, for I saw two men in Shoreditch, who I thought belonged to her; she still kept hold of my arm; the first watchman I came to I asked to see me to the next box - I did not tell him I suspected the prisoner, as I understood he was a private watchman, and could not go; she kept laying hold of my arm. I sat down on the step of a public-house to rest; she sat down on the step also. I did not see the other two men after leaving Shoreditch; I fell into a dose; I only had two or three glasses of beer and a pint of porter; when I awoke, I found it was just three o'clock; she was gone then.

About half an hour after Irons sent for me - I found Nicholls there - I told her of the charge; she had the duplicate of the seal in her hand, pawned in the name of Ann Moore ; she said she found it by Whitechapel-church. I said that was impossible, for the gentleman had only lost it that morning; she made no answer. I took her to Moor's-alley, where Fisher was in Kennedy's custody - and asked Nicholls for the duplicate of the watch; she took me into another room next door to Fisher's - and on the mantle-piece I found the duplicate of a watch, pawned in the name of Norris; she said she sent Fisher to pawn it. RICHARD BASSOU . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Bishopsgate-street. Nicholls pawned a seal with me on the 1st of June, about nine o'clock in the morning, for 2 s. 6 d.

DANIEL VALENTINE was indicted for stealing, on the 25th of May, one hundred and thirty-two pounds of candles, value 28 l. , the goods of Edward Pain ; and JAMES BRADSHAW was indicted for feloniously receiving the same, knowing them to be stolen .EDWARD JOSEPH PAIN . I am the son of Edward Pain , a wax-chandler; who lives at Graven-hill, Paddington. I assist in my father's business. On Saturday morning, the 25th of May, these candles were missed from the manufactory; the prisoner Valentine was a stranger; I was in town on the afternoon of that day, and being informed of the loss, went to Bow-street, and then to Mr. Stevens's, where I found three pounds of wax candles. I then went to Bradshaw's house, Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road, and found the rest. We missed eleven dozen and a half in all. Bradshaw said he had bought them of Valentine. I went and got an officer.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Bradshaw produced them immediately - A. Yes. I saw one paper behind the counter, and the rest in the parlour; he said he bought them of a person who was sitting in the parlour; but I saw nobody there - I did not go in; there is a way out of the parlour without coming through the shop; he deals in rags and fat. I attended before the Justice. Bradshaw offered to give every assistance he could, and bring witnesses to prove his case. Francis-street is a respectable street. RAYMOND PAIN . I live at the manufactory. I missed the candles about a quarter before nine o'clock, on the 25th of May; they were safe the night before. I missed eight dozen and a half of wax short threes, and two dozen and a half of wax short fours, and six pounds of wax long fours; they were kept in the tying-up room. An iron-bar had been forced away to get in. I acquainted my father. I found the candles at the office, and knew them. We never sell goods at the manufactory; the town house is in Berwick-street. WILLIAM HAGUE . I am foreman to Mr. Pain. I was told of this just before nine o'clock in the morning, and found the bar was bent, so that a man could get through. I had seen the property safe at ten o'clock at night. I found five pounds of them at Stevens's, in Tottenham-court-road, and, in consequence of what he told me, I went to Bow-street; and from there to Bradshaw's, with an officer; it appeared like a rag and bottle shop. I found the candles; some were unpacked; I knew the paper they were in by our stamp being on them; he is a dealer in grease. JOHN CAPES . I am a constable. On the 11th of June, I apprehended Valentine at the Brown Bear , Devonshire-street, Queen-square. I asked if his name was Valentine; he said it was not. I also asked if he was a servant out of place, he said No; he said his name was David Mimms. I asked if he knew anybody in Gower-street; he said No. I then asked if he knew any one in Francis-street; he said No; he said he was a linen-draper from Newport Pannel. I asked him if he could refer me to anybody who knew him; he said he could, and asked me what made me put so many questions to him; I said I was looking for a person, and he seemed to answer the description - and asked if he would walk to a person who would give an account of him. As he was not willing to go, I asked if he would walk with me to Francis-street, and that would satisfy my suspicious; he came out to go, and went with me through Queen-square, and going through the passage into Southampton-street, he asked if I was an officer. I said Yes - he said he thought he knew my business; I said,""Your name is Daniel Valentine , is it not?"" he said Yes; and he supposed it was about the wax candles - and asked where Bradshaw was; I said in custody - he said he was sorry for it. I told him to be cautious what he said; he told me that he was in Rhodes's-fields, where they were making hay, and two men came up to him heavily laden, and said they had some goods to dispose of, if he would buy them, as they were in want of money; he found they were candles - they asked 5 l. for them; he offered them 2 l., and gave it them; that they said they had brought them from Northampton.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You questioned him without telling him your business - A. Yes. Bradshaw had given information which led to his detection. BENJAMIN BOWYER . I am an Excise-officer; my office is on the first floor of Bradshaw's house. About eight o'clock in the morning of the 25th of May, I was called out of my office by Bradshaw. I went into the parlour and saw Valentine. Bradshaw said he was buying candles of Valentine, and wished me to write the receipt for him; he gave me a stamp. I then asked Valentine if he sold the candles for himself, or for anybody else; he said not for himself, but for John Smith ; he said the price was 2 s. per pound, and the quantity was one-hundred and thirty-nine pounds. I think I cast it up and told Bradshaw the amount; he said I was right, and as I wrote the receipt, I observed it was a great weight; before that, Valentine had told me that Smith was a servant in some great family - and that he had known him ten years, and that the gentleman he lived with was going to break up his establishment, and had remunerated Smith for his services with these things among others. I handed the receipt to Valentine to sign, which he did, and I went away.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see the candles - A. They asked if I would look at them; but I was in a hurry.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long has your office been in his house - A. Twelve months; they could have done their business without me if they liked; there was no secret in it; the shop door was open. Bradshaw bears a good character. GEORGE WRIGHT . I am an officer. On the 25th ofMay, Pain came about this; I went to Stevens's shop in Tottenham-court-road, and found some candles; in consequence of what he said, we went to Bradshaw's, and found one hundred and thirty-two pounds of candles there; there was a number of papers laying about; he gave up the candles immediately, with the receipt; and said he bought them of a young man who was then in the parlour. I had seen a person coming out of the side door just before. I immediately went into the parlour - nobody was there; the person who came out was dressed as Valentine was at the time he was apprehended. Bradshaw pointed out the candles - they were in the parlour, and the door was open.(Receipt read.)Received of Mr. Bradshaw, 13 l. 18 s. for one hundred and thirty-nine pounds of damaged wax-candles, at 2 s. per pound, for Thomas Smith . DANIEL VALENTINE .Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Was there anything like concealment - A. Not at all. I saw the person leave the door just before I went in. Mr. Pain had gone in before me, and while he was in the shop the man came out. Bradshaw gave every assistance in his power to detect him; he was out day and night with me; and I believe he offered a reward of 10 l., but I am not certain. WILLIAM HAGUE . These papers have a stamp on them - and the candles are stamped""Pain, 91, Bernard-street.""Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q, They are broken - A. Many of them are, and the tops of some of them are just lit; some are not at all damaged; they were not so when at the manufactory. We give about 2 s. a pound for pieces.BRADSHAW'S Defence. I am innocent. THOMAS KNOWLES . I am a wax and tallow-chandler, and live in Orange-street, Red Lion-square. I have known Bradshaw six years. On Saturday morning he brought me some wax candles in a paper, and said he had an offer from a person who he knew very well, in the service of gentlemen in the neighbourhood, to sell him some candles. I told him they were very old and stale. I consulted my uncle, and told him he ought not to give more than 2 s., for I would only give him 2 s. 2 d. CORNELIUS COLLETT . On the 25th of May, I was at Bradshaw's house; he said he had some candles which he was going to take down to Mr. Pain, and asked me to accompany him. I saw them put into a basket to be carried there - this was about twelve o'clock; a heavy storm had come on before, which I supposed detained him; he was going to sell them to Pain, as he said he supposed the maker would give the best price.- STEVENS. Part of the candles were found at my shop; I had bought them of Bradshaw an hour or two before. I gave 2 s. a pound, and 2 s. 4 d. for long pieces. I did not observe Mr. Pain's name on it, till Mr. Pain shewed it to me.VALENTINE - GUILTY . Aged 27.

We then went to No. 7, Holland-street, and found the door ajar, wrenched by some instrument; the pipe had been taken from the passage running from the kitchen to the area; we fitted the pipe to the place, and a piece left in the wall fitted it; it weighed fifty six pounds. Bidgood asked him where he got it; he made no answer. He (Bidgood) then said, he dare say it came from No. 7, Holland-street; he said he knew where it came from. THOMAS CHOWNER .

I told him of the tea I had found in his pocket the morning before; he said he had nothing of the kind. On the 15th we found three quarters of pound in papers in the corner of his hat. We send it into the country to be sold in small quantities. He pleaded distress. He had one guinea a week when he was regularly employed - but he was only employed occasionally for the last six months.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He bore a good character - A. Yes.MR. THOMAS CROSSLEY . I am in partnership with my brother. On the 15th I was concealed under the stairs. About seven o'clock the prisoner came to work, and about eight he was going to breakfast - he went round the counter, and took off the lid of the canister; out of which he took a quantity of tea, and put it in his pocket - he then came round to the other end of the counter, where the teas which are packed up are kept - he took off his hat, and put three packages into the hat; put the handkerchief over them, and put it on his head; he was going out of the door - my brother said he wanted to speak to him. I then came forward, and said,""You are taken at last,"" and fetched Drinkwater, who found the tea in his hat, and some loose in his pocket. WILLIAM DRINKWATER . I was sent for. He pulled off his hat, in which I found the tea, and about six ounces in his pocket. He said he had done wrong, but it was through distress. I found more tea at his lodging. I found 2 l. 3 s. in his pocket, and ten sovereigns in his room. GUILTY . Aged 29. Transported for Seven Years .London Jury, before Mr. Recorder.",guilty,none

PLATT conducted the prosecution. RICHARD IVES . I live at Bethnal-green. On Sunday, the 11th of August, about a quarter before 10 o'clock at night, I was in Church-street, Bethnal-green, passing a court by the Flower Pot, public-house, Ramsay was before me, meeting me, and Greenwood was behind, following me. Greenwood coughed, and Ramsay immediately made a rush, and snatched at my seal, ring, and key, which were attached to my watch and chain; he separated them from the chain, and in trying to get them away, he struck me a blow on the side; this was before he got them; he pulled twice to get them. Ramsay ran down the court. I hollowed, Stop thief! and Greenwood came up and said,""D - n his eyes, I'll have him;"" and ran down the court. The officers then came up and asked if I was robbed. We went to the Flower Pot , and went in search of them at several houses - among others, to the George in George-yard, where we found the prisoners. I will swear they are the same persons - I could see them plainly by a strong light, and am positive of them. When I went into the George, I looked round, and saw the prisoners and another man sitting on a settle in the bar. The officer told me to go into the tap-room, to see if they were there, but I still kept my eye on the prisoners in the bar. I found the bar door bolted, and told the landlord to open it. Ramsay threw down his pipe, and was going out - he was stopped by the officers. I told him to put his hat on, and said I was certain of him - he said I accused him wrongfully. Greenwood did not attempt to escape. I am quite certain of them, on my oath - they were taken about an hour or an hour and a quarter after the robbery. We found nobody at the other public-houses.Cross-examined by Mr. PLATT. Q. Do not they call the court Brick-lane - A. I do not know; it is the court next the Flower Pot . There was a gas light on the other side of the way, which enabled me to see. The transaction did not last long, but Ramsay overshot the court in running, which gave me an opportunity of seeing him - the light reflected in their faces, and I saw Ramsay as he came towards me; and he could not get my seals at the first pull - I looked him in the face while he was taking them. I described them correctly before I saw them in the public-house.Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate you thought you knew Ramsay's back, but would not swear to him - A. I said I would swear to his person altogether. When I went into the bar a second time, Ramsay was putting downhis pipe and walking out - I said,""Stop that man."" I said nothing else till he said,""You accuse me wrongfully."" I then desired him to put on his hat.MR. LAW. Q. Was the light so situated as to throw a strong light on the passage - A. It was.COURT. Q. Had you looked behind you before the robbery - A. No; I observed Greenwood's red hair; the light was very strong. I looked at him as he passed me, thinking he might have come to assist me. I know it was him who coughed. One of my seals was found in the court they ran down. WILLIAM GIBBS . I am a constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and went over to Ives, and accompanied him to the George. We found the prisoners there, with another person. As soon as we got in, Ramsay went out at the bar door - there are two or three doors in the bar. Ives told me to bring him back. My brother officer stopped him at the tap-room door. He told Ives he charged him wrongfully; he had said nothing but""Stop that man"" - or I must have heard it. Greenwood kept his seat.Cross-examined. Q. Who went into the room first - A. A patrol and I, then Ives, Goddard, and Wood. I had my staff - Ramsay knew me perfectly well. We took all the three men, as we always do on finding them at such a house as this where thieves resort - Ives only gave the two prisoners in charge. Ramsay got up to go away before a word was said by any body. ROBERT WOOD . I am a constable. I accompanied Ives to the George - we went into the tap-room, and were turning round to go into the bar, when Ives and Gibbs saw the prisoners and another man seated in the bar. Ramsay got up to go out. Ives said,""Go and stop that man."" I being near the door, went out and stopped him; he was brought in. He said to the prosecutor,""You accuse me wrongfully; I know nothing about it."" Ives said,""Put his hat on,"" which we did. He then said,""He is the man who robbed me."" Nobody had said a word before but""Stop that man.""Cross-examined. Q. More might have been said without your hearing it - A. I am positive nothing more was said - I was close at Ives's elbow.COURT. Q. He only said,""You accuse me wrongfully"" - A. That is all, my Lord; he was going out of the door when I stopped him - he had not began to run - he said,""What do you want? you accuse me wrongfully."" We dragged him in, and he said a second time to the prosecutor,""You accuse me wrongfully, Sir.""RAMSAY'S Defence. I know nothing of it; nor did I ever say,""You accuse me wrongfully.""

This was about three nights before I missed my money. I had twelve sovereigns and nine guineas in the chest, which was locked; the key was in my breeches pocket, and my breeches under my pillow.

I asked how he came by so much money; he said he got it from the Captain whom he came with. I had had every body in the house searched before that morning - he said he supposed if he had been at home he should have been overhauled as well as the rest; and though he was a dark man, he committed no robberies.

HENRY WOODCOCK . I am a superannuated Excise-officer, and live at Colchester. On the 15th of August, I was in Whitechapel, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; it was quite light. I was walking along the path with my great coat under my arm, and my canvas purse in my breeches pocket - it had thirty-five sovereigns and four half-crowns in it. I had been drinking, but knew what I was about very well - I was a little in liquor. Two women came up to me - one laid hold of my arms, and pushed me into Nelson's-court. I resisted, and desired them to let me go; they said I should not. There were people passing. I was frightened, for I could not get out of their arms. They swore I should go to their lodging; I refused - one of them seized my great coat, and took it from me, and the other put her hand into my pocket, and took out my purse, and ran away - both ran up the court. I thought I saw them go into a house in the court; but a man said they were gone one way, and another said they were gone another way. They were making a fool of me, and I gave no heed to them. One of the women was tall, and the other short, and had a full black eye. I can swear positively that the two prisoners are the two women. I did not see them again till next morning, and was then confident of them.Q. Did you not express a doubt about it at Worship-street - A. I said I firmly believed they were the women.Q. You were examined before the Justice, and said,""I think they were the persons; I was rather in liquor, and therefore cannot swear to them"" - A. I do not recollect saying any such a word. I gave information at the watch-house between eight and nine o'clock, and described them.Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were middling drunk - A. I was partly drunk - I had only drank beer. I did not express a doubt about them.Q. Did you not say you could not positively speak to them, because you were intoxicated - A. I said something about that. I swear to them, to the best of my knowledge, and belief. They were off in a twinkling. I was afraid of being murdered. I showed the constable the spot where it happened.Q. Did you not take the officer to several places before you fixed on the spot - A. When I got to the places, I said that was not the place till I came to Nelson-court; I then said that was it; there are several courts about. I was not drunk; there were many people passing; I could not call them, because I was dragged up the court; I do not think I ever said I could not swear to them. JOHN CLARK . I am an officer of Whitechapel. On the 15th of August the prosecutor came to me to the watch-house, and said he had been robbed by two women; that one was tall and the other short; that he could not swear to them - he did not describe them further. I went down the road with him, to see if he could point out the place where he was robbed; he looked up two courts, and at last pointed out Nelson's-court, and said that was the place, not the others. I advised him to go home to bed; he was a great deal in liquor. About an hour after he went home, I had information, and went to Cummins' house, and searched it - she lives in Nelson's-court, and I believe, alone. I searched the back yard; and found this great coat, half in and half out of the privy, as it was partly broken down; it was not concealed. I have had it ever since. She said she did not know how it came there; she supposed it was thrown over the wall, which might have happened. I took her to the watch-house. About nine o'clock the next morning, I questioned her again about the coat; she said Hannah had thrown it on her arm. She described Hannah as a Jewess, and pock-marked. I went to Plunkett - he said he knew Hannah - we went to Luke-street, and took Stanton. They would not open the door, and I got in at the window; it is a corner house. I saw the window of the other room open, and called to Plunkett; he followed and took Stanton; her husband was shutting the window down.Cross-examined. Q. You think he was very much in liquor - A. Yes; he said he could only swear to his coat, and not to the prisoners. When he saw Nelson's-court, he knew it by the post in the middle, which he had clung to. I think the coat might have been thrown over, but it could not then have hung as it did, which was quite smooth. Cummins said in Stanton's presence that she had thrown it in. RICHARD PLUNKETT . I went with the last witness, in the morning of the 16th, and searched Stanton's house; I knew her before. Nobody would let us in. My partner got in, and desired me to give a look out; when I turned the corner, I could see no one but a man coming towards me. I returned to a chandler's shop, and enquired if she was there; they said No, but I found her up stairs on the first floor. I said,""I want you, Stanton."" She said,""Oh, Mr. Plunkett, have you a warrant against me?"" She said she had a row with a girl, and she thought I had a warrant about it. I said I wanted her for a robbery in Whitechapel-road. She said she knew nothing of any robbery. I found 12 s. 6 d. in her bosom - I found a steel purse in a turn-up bedstead, containing 16 s. 6 d. which she said was private money of her own.CUMMIN'S Defence. I am innocent.STANTON'S Defence.

BARBARA LANGFORD . I am the wife of Thomas Langford ; we live in Shacklewell-street, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. On the 29th of August, about five o'clock, the prisoner came home with me. I had some silk up stairs, tied in a handkerchief, and put in an old bag. While he was there I said,""I will go up stairs and look after my property."" I had known him a long time. He did not go up with me, nor did I bring the silk down, or say any thing about it; but he knew we had silk, as we get our living by it. About half-past eight I said I would go to my husband's club, to see if he was coming home. The prisoner said,""You go outside, mistress, and put the shutters too, and I will fasten them."" I left him inside the house, to fasten the shutters; he came out, and I locked the door, and went to my husband's club - he went away. I was fetched home by my neighbours about a quarter before nine, and found the window shutter was broken open, and the window shoved up, which was shut when I went out. I missed the silk, which was left with me to wind. I have to pay for it all; there were eight knots, weighing nine ounces and a half, and are charged to me by my employer 28 s. 6 d. I have never seen it since.Prisoner. Q. Who took you off the tap-room table drunk, at half-past nine o'clock, and led you home drunk - A. I was not in liquor; he did not lead me home, but ran down the street as fast as he could. I was at the Green Gate, public-house, for five minutes, and went from thence to the Black Dog, for my husband; but I had been home with the prisoner before that. SARAH BROWN . I live next door to Mr. Langford; I saw the prisoner come home with Mr. Langford between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and Mrs. Langford came home in about ten minutes; they afterwards all went out together, and about eight o'clock in the evening the prisoner came home with Mrs. Langford. He came to me for a light - I gave him a candle and candlestick. He said,""Mrs. Langford, go out and shut the shutters, and I'll fasten them;"" which she did, and he fastened them, to the best of my knowledge. She then went in, and they both came out together. I cannot say she was properly sober; she had drank a little. I saw them fasten the door and go up the street together; and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after, he came down the street alone; he tried the door and found it fast; he then opened the window shutters, threw up the sash, and got into the room; he remained there three or five minutes. I and Dawson watched him, and saw him get out, leaving the shutters and windows open, and run away. After that he returned again with Mrs. Langford, and she said,""My God, the shutters and windows are open;"" he said,""Yes, I know they are; for I came back to the place, thinking it was not safe, and I thought I heard somebody on the premises, and could not get in at the door; so I got in at the window, and finding nobody there, I came away again."" He went away - I saw no more of him till the Monday, when the officer brought him to Langford's. I am sure he is the man - I had seen him three times in the course of the day. I asked why he did not fasten the shutters and window? he said, because he was frightened, and thought they might think he had robbed them.Prisoner. Q. Where did I go to after getting out of the window - A. To the Black Dog. He leant over the bar door and said to the landlady,""Mrs. Stokes, I wish you would go up to Langford, and tell him to come down, for his house is open; and if anything is a miss, I am afraid he may think it is me."" This was after Mrs. Langford had come home. THOMAS LANGFORD . I met the prisoner on the 29th of August, and had something to drink with him. I have never found the silk, and know nothing of the robbery.Prisoner. Q. Were you not very drunk - A. I had been drinking, but was able to go to the club. He bore a good character while he worked for me, which was some time ago. WILLIAM GIBBS . I apprehended the prisoner on Monday, the 2d of September, with another man, at the corner of Flower Pot-alley, Bethnal-green. I found nothing on him. He said,""I understand you have information against me."" I said, Yes. He said he knew nothing of the charge.Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I was informed that night that Langford said I had robbed him, and I was willing to go with you - A. Yes; he well knew I should not let him go; for I had been after him ever since the robbery.Prisoner's Defence (Written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I declare before the face of Almighty God, that I am innocent of the charge. I was at the Green Gate, public house, on the 30th of August; the prosecutor and his wife came and sat in the same box, and observed that they had known me from a child, and I had worked for them when young; I drank with them, and went with them to the Black Dog, and sat drinking till Langford said he was tired and sleepy; they asked me to see them home, which I did. Mrs. Langford said she was going out, and told me to call Langford about eight o'clock, to go to his club; I went away and returned at that time, when I found the shutters open; and went to the Black Dog and told him his place was not safe. He seemed to take no notice. I went down, and found Mrs. Langford asleep on the taproom table. I took her home, got a light, and asked her if all was safe. I heard no more till Monday night, when I saw Gibbs, and was agreeable to go any where. I went to the watch-house without being collared.Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.

PLATT and LAW conducted the prosecution.LIEUTENANT FREDERICK BOYCE . I have a house in Hay's-place; there is a stable to it, which is in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone. I have a room over the stable, which has occasionally been occupied by myself and my servant. I keep my horse in the stable. I had let part of the house; but kept the stable in my own possession, and the room over it, and had a bed there, and slept there at times. I left town some time in June, intending to return, and use the room as usual. I returned the latter end of June or July - I had left Powell, my house-keeper, in care of the room, to sleep there or in the house, which she liked. I had a bureau in the room, in which I left my gold watch and chain, and another gold chain separated from the watch, a gold and pearl brooch, a musical snuff-box, a silver snuff-box, a silver tea-pot, and considerable other property. When I came to town, I missed the articles stated in the indictment - I had seen them safe five or six days before I left town. I was absent a fortnight. The bureau was locked. In consequence of information, I apprehended the prisoner in Broad-street, on the 7th or 8th of July. I saw him searched. The constable shewed me two duplicates, which I returned him.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are the stables immediately behind the house - A. Yes, and connected with it, and in the same parish. The gold watch cost twenty-eight guineas. ANN POWELL . I was housekeeper to Mr. Boyce in June and July. He left town in June, and returned in July. The prisoner is a nephew of mine. While my master was absent, he came to the place, and slept in the room where the bureau was for above a week at different times. I do not recollect the last time he was there. GEORGE GILLESPIE . I am a watchman. The prosecutor brought the prisoner to me in Broad-street, Golden-square, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, on the 7th of July. As we went to the watch-house, he said,""My G - d, Sir, don't send me to the watch-house - I shall return you all your property to-morrow."" Mr. Boyce said,""Say nothing to convict yourself; I don't want to convict you."" ROBERT CHARLES CHAPMAN . I am constable of the night. I searched the prisoner, and found three duplicates on him, and a key. In the course of the night, he said, he had stolen the watch, and pledged it, and sold the duplicate to a Mr. Turner. I found Turner in the morning by the prisoner's description, and I saw him deliver a gold watch, seal, and key to Suttie. CHARLES VAUGHAN . I am servant to Mr. Dry, a pawnbroker, in St. Martin's-lane. On the 21st of June, the prisoner pawned a musical snuff-box, for 1 l. - I am certain of him. Next day he pawned a gold watch, with chain, seal, and key, for 14 l.; he said he brought them from Captain Boyce, 12, Edgware-road. Turner came to redeem the gold watch about a week after. On the 3d of July, a brooch was pawned for 12 s., by a young man, who said he came from Turner. (A duplicate found on the prisoner for a brooch, was here produced). This was what I gave the person - it is in my hand writing. GEORGE TURNER . I gave Suttie a watch, chain, and seals. I had the duplicate from the prisoner at the Horse and Groom, public-house, Castle-street. He had asked me to lend him 3 l. on a duplicate of a watch, and I said I had no objection, and that I should redeem the watch, as the interest would be considerable, and hoped he would take it from me as soon as possible. I redeemed it at Dry's. THOMAS SUTTIE . I produce the watch I received from Turner. I am assistant to Chapman. GEORGE TURNER . This is the watch. CHARLES VAUGHAN . They are the watch and seals which were pawned with me. EDWARD CORBAN . I pawned this broach at Dry's. The prisoner sent me with it. I gave him the duplicate.MR. BOYCE. The property is all mine. The watch cost twenty-eight guineas, and is worth forty guineas with appendages.Cross-examined. Q. Where did you leave the key of the bureau - A. In a little box in the bureau drawer, which was locked, but it could be opened by taking off the bureau. The stable is connected with the premises by walls.Three witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character. GUILTY - DEATH .

JOHN GROMUS . I am superintendant of the London Gas Light and Coke Company. In consequence of information, I went to the pig market in Smithfield, where the Company had several hundred yards of pipe; I charged the prisoner there with taking the pipe, and gave him in custody. I told him there were witnesses to prove he had taken it from the spot; he then said he had taken it, and would shew us the place it was in; he took us to a house in Field-lane, which he said belonged to one Sheppard. The officer found the pipe there, broken in three pieces. Sheppard said he believed the prisoner to be the person he bought it of, and that he gave him 6 1/2 d. for it; it cost the Company 5 s.; I do not know the value of it when broken up.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It lay in the open street - A. Yes; it was six feet long. The officer told him he had been seen breaking it with a stone, and taking it away. JOSEPH CLARK . I am agent to Ward and Co. iron merchants, Black friars-road; we furnished several hundred yards of iron pipe to the Gas Company; the pipe in question is the same sort; the price was 5 s.; it is worth 2 s. 3 d. or 2 s. 6 d. in the state it is now in. DANIEL GOLDING . I live at the corner of the pig market. The prisoner was one of the paviours there; I saw him take the pipe from the corner to the end of the market, and break it with a large stone. I followed him to Sheppard's shop in Field-lane with the largest piece, and saw it laid in the scale. It is an old iron shop. JEREMIAH GOLDING .

Whitaker took him. The spade had no business near the gate; he had moved it from the shed; it was the Company's spade. GEORGE WHITAKER . I am watchman of Bridewell.

ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution.MR. RICHARD HOLMES LAURIE. I am a map and print-seller, and live at No. 53, Fleet-street, in the parish of St. Dunstan in the West. In August last the prisoner was in my employ, as errand boy, and slept in the house. Between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 27th of July, I was called up and informed that the house was broken open. On examining the counting-house, I found the desk broken open, and also the iron closet opened, and a drawer within the iron closet, which contained the notes and sovereigns stated in the indictment, in a bag, and bills and papers. I cannot exactly say how many sovereigns there were, but I presume about forty or fifty; there were two 10 l. bank-notes, and one 5 l.; they were gone also; a snuffbox, which had a portrait of the Duke of Wellington, was taken out of the chest. The prisoner had repeatedly seen me put money in the iron chest. No other place was forced open. I searched the house all over, with the watchman, but found nobody; I called the prisoner up, and he assisted in the search; in the course of which he went into the kitchen, where there is a copper on the left hand side, and on the right there is a flue, to convey steam into the chimney; the prisoner got up on the copper, to search this flue; I said,""What is the use of your getting up there? nobody can be hid there;"" he got down, and made no farther observation. Between ten and eleven o'clock next morning, Harrison the officer examined the premises; he told the prisoner he should search him, and said it must be some person in the house who had done it. The maid servant and the shopman slept in the house, besides the prisoner; they were all searched, but nothing found. Four days after, from other causes, the prisoner was taken to Guildhall, and discharged; he was still in my service, and after he was examined, I gave orders that he should not be admitted into any part of the house but the shop; he did not know of these orders. The maid servant was discharged after the prisoner's examination, not about this robbery, but about something the prisoner said of her conduct; the prisoner went before the girl; I discharged him after his examination on the 3d of August; she stopped in my service till the prisoner was taken a second time. About two days after his discharge he called for his clothes, which were kept in a garret where he slept; I ordered them to be brought down to him, which was done; he endeavoured to go down the kitchen stairs, but the servant hindered him; he did go down the back cellar stairs for some brushes. I saw some chimney sweepers ring at the bell about seven o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 13th of August; in consequence of this I directed that none should sweep the chimneys but Mr. Brown or a person in his employ. On the Thursday Mr. Brown's boy came, and the servant knocked at my bed-room door, and gave Mrs. Laurie, in my presence, a bag containing forty-seven sovereigns, and one was found afterwards; I am sure the bag is the same which was in my chest, and the amount is the same, as near as I can guess. I expected the two boys to call again on Friday, to sweep the chimney, and got Harrison to be ready in case they came, which they did about seven o'clock, and were let in. Harrison came across, and apprehended them, and in about a quarter of an hour after they came I saw the prisoner in Harrison's custody; he had gone out in consequence of what the sweeps said, and brought the prisoner in in about two minutes; he was taken before Mr. Alderman Brown, and committed.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. How many days after the alarm did the prisoner leave your service - A. It happened on the 27th of July, and he left on the 3d of August; he had full access to the house for the first four days.Q. And had ample time and opportunity to remove any thing during the seven days - A. Certainly; the counting house is in the back part of the premises; he must come down from the garret into the shop to go there. When the alarm was given, I found the street door open, and the counting-house door also; the side of the desk was wrenched off, as well as the lock being picked or forced; it must have taken some time to do it; the chest was open, and the lock of the drawer in it picked. I called the prisoner down from his bed-room. He made some charges against theservant girl, and that girl brought the sovereigns up. The bank-notes and snuff-box are not found.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did the servant sleep - A. On the 3d floor; the shopman slept in the next room to the prisoner; they were all alarmed at the same time, dressed, and came down. I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock that night; I could easily hear a person come down stairs if he had his shoes on. WILLIAM GILLESPIE . I am a watchman; my box is several doors from the prosecutor's, on the same side of the way; I passed his house every half hour, and looked at all the doors; if his had been opened, I must have seen it. I did not notice it open at half-past three; but a little before four, two men came by, and said Mr. Laurie's door was open; I found it so, and alarmed the family; I assisted Mr. Laurie and two of his servants in searching the house, but found nothing.Cross-examined. Q. You only go round every half-hour - A. No. I had not passed the door five minutes before I received the information. I did not stop the two men; they went away. ARCHIBALD LUNAIN . I am a watchman. My box is nearly opposite Mr. Laurie's door - I can see the door from it. I saw nobody about it on the night in question to cause my suspicion - I was called by Gillespie, and went over with him. I go my rounds every half-hour, and am seldom in my box. ANTHONY HARRISON . I am a marshalman. I went to Mr. Laurie's house first about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock, and was shewn the state of things; there was no force on the door from without; it must have been opened from within. I have no doubt about it. There was a chain and bar to the door, neither of which were forced. I searched the premises; no place had been opened or attempted to be opened, except where the property was. We called the prisoner up stairs, and questioned him. I told him I thought somebody had broken out, and not in; I searched him, and all the servants, but found nothing. On Friday, the 16th of August, I went to the prosecutor's house about five o'clock in the morning; I was walking up and down opposite the house, watching for two sweeps; and just before seven o'clock two chimney sweeps came. I followed them into the house. The servant let them in. I questioned them for full ten minutes; the servant girl was there all the time, and in consequence of an observation she made, I ran out instantly up to the left, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Crane-court under the arch of the court, against the wall, singing - I took him, and said,""This is found out, Mr. Charles;"" he said nothing. I took him over to Mr. Laurie's, into the presence of the two sweeps, and the servant. The biggest sweep said,""That is the man who hired me to sweep the chimnies, and to take the bag of gold out, and I was to have two sovereigns"" - the prisoner said nothing; the sweep said to Mr. Laurie,""I did not mean to take the gold out of the house, Sir, but to give it you."" He then said to the prisoner,""What a pretty mess you have got me into?"" the prisoner said nothing - the other sweep was frightened. I took them all three to the Compter. The prisoner was committed, and the sweeps discharged.Cross-examined. Q. Who was present while you were questioning the sweeps - A. Mr. Laver, the shopman, the girl, and Mills, who was with me, and I think Mr. Laurie was coming down stairs. The door must have been opened inside.Q. Anybody connected with persons outside could let them in - A. Certainly. The sweep said he was to go down to the chimney below, and in a certain flue he would find a bag of money.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went out in consequence of what the maid-servant said - A. Yes. I had seen her looking out of the window for an hour before. STANDLEY HOGDEN . I am a chimney-sweeper to Mr. Brown, who sweeps the prosecutor's chimney. On Thursday, the 15th of August, about seven o'clock in the morning, I went to sweep the chimney, and in the steam flue of the kitchen, I found a bag containing something; I gave it to the servant girl. I looked into the flue with a light, and found a sovereign, which I gave to the servant. I thought there was money in the bag, because I heard it jingle. She took the bag up stairs, and told me to go up the chimney.Cross-examined. Q. Did the girl tell you to look in that flue - A. Nobody told me - I was feeling for the copper flue, which goes into the chimney, for if we do not attend to that the soot goes into it. When I gave her the bag, she told me to go on; and when I came down, Mr. Laurie told me to look further, and I found the sovereign.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went to the flue quite by accident - A. Quite. SARAH HEAVEN . I was Mr. Laurie's servant in July and August. After the robbery, I remember two chimney sweeps coming to the door - I did not open it; the errand boy told them when to come again. I did not hear him - they were not let in. Two days after the last witness came, and swept the chimney. I was in the kitchen when he found the bag in the flue - he went there of his own accord. He delivered me a bag from the flue - I opened it, and saw it contained sovereigns, and immediately took it up stairs, and gave it to my mistress in the presence of my master. After the chimney was swept, I saw the boy take a single sovereign from the flue. On the following morning Harrison was set to watch the house. I was up at six o'clock, an hour before the two sweeps came. I placed myself at the front room, second floor window, with the sash up. The two sweeps came. I saw the prisoner a quarter of an hour before that time, at the back of a mail coach, standing up holding the straps, going towards St. Pauls's; I saw him no where else. When Harrison spoke to the sweeps I told him what I had seen; (They were the two boys who had been there three days before). He went out to look for the prisoner, and returned with him in two or three minutes. The biggest sweep said,""You are a pretty fellow for bringing me into this scrape,"" and that the prisoner was the lad who sent him to sweep the chimneys, and to tell the lie, by saying that he came from Mr. Brown's when he did not. The prisoner made no answer. I do not remember anything more being said. The money was produced.Cross-examined. Q. Were you servant of all-work - A. Yes. I had twelve guineas a year.Q. Were you very angry with the boy for the accusations he made against you - A. No, because some of it was true, and I forgive him the rest. I saw the sweeps come twice,their faces were black. I do not know that I had seen them at other times. I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock on the night of the robbery.Q. I suppose you were accused of having sweet-hearts - A. Yes. I saw nobody on the night of the robbery, I am positive. I slept in the back room, second floor. I am not in service now.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was any body in the house with you on that night, or did you see any body there - A. No. I was not dismissed in consequence of the robbery. THOMAS SEEKINS . I am a chimney-sweeper, and live in One Tun-court, Strand. I am climbing journeyman to Mrs. Watson. I was never in Mr. Brown's employ. I know the prisoner; he first spoke to me one Monday, in the Strand; he met me there, and said he had left his place in Fleet-street, and told me to go and see about the kitchen chimnies; I was to ring the bell or knock, and I should see the servant or the young lad. He told me to tell the lad if I saw him, that the chimney had not been done for three months. He said there was a bag of money in the copper flue, and I was to bring it away, and he would give me two sovereigns - that it would not chink; it was tied up safe. I had never swept Mr. Laurie's chimnies. I was to say I came from Brown's of Water-lane. I went to Mr. Laurie's on Monday morning, and the lad told me to come next morning, which I did, and was let in, and told to come on Friday morning at six o'clock. I saw the prisoner on the Monday evening in the Strand, about half-past six o'clock, and on Tuesday morning I saw him about seven o'clock, and told him what I was to do, and he said then it would be all right. I went on Friday morning, and Harrison came and took me into custody. I had Woolley, a boy, with me - I do not think he knew what it was about; he was present on Monday when the prisoner spoke, but did not know what passed between us. Harrison spoke to me in the shop, then went out, and brought in the prisoner - I said,""You have brought me in a nice scrape."" I had told him in the Strand that if I got the bag I would give it to the gentleman or lady - he said I ought to be ashamed of myself, and I mentioned it in the shop that morning. I was taken before the Alderman.Cross-examined. Q. Do you still work for Mrs. Watson - A. Yes. I saw the lad on Monday and Tuesday mornings. I am quite sure I saw nobody but him. I saw the shopman and servant girl on Friday, and not before.Q. Why did you not go, and tell Mr. Laurie of this - A. I know I am guilty of that; I kept it to myself till Friday; I told the prisoner on Monday, that I should give it to the lady or gentleman. When he first spoke to me, he said he was very wild that he could not go into the kitchen to get the money out of the flue. I told nobody of it. I have served ten years with Watson, and am thirty years old. I told the constable what the prisoner told me; I had nothing to do with him before, but have often seen him go through Hungerford market. I knew nothing of it till he told me.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You never spoke to him till Monday - A. No; I never saw the servant before Friday, whether she saw me by looking through the window, I cannot say: I did not see her at the window (looking at her).Q. Did you expect any thing for returning the money to the gentleman - A. Unless he chose to give me any thing. I told Harrison, who sent me about the chimney before he brought the prisoner in. SARAH HEAVEN . I saw him on Tuesday out of the window; I cannot say whether he saw me. JAMES BROWN . I am a chimney-sweeper, and have worked for Mr. Laurie twenty years; I sent my man there on Thursday, by order, but never sent Seekins there.MR. LAURIE. I produce the bag; it is the same which contained the sovereigns stolen on the night in question; here is a mark on it; I had only one; it contained many more than two sovereigns.Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say, my Lord; I leave it all to my Counsel.Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character. GUILTY - DEATH .

I went to the warehouse, and found the box broken open; I found a parcel lying on the floor, under the warehouse; it was tied round with tarred twine; I gave it to Roberts. An apron was found in another warehouse on the same floor; the box was among other packages. THOMAS HOSIER . I know the contents of the box, as we had a dispute about it; I know these to be part of the things; it lay in our lumber-room, and could be easily got at. The prisoner was searched the same night; hedenied ever having seen the parcel, and also the twine, by which it was tied. I gave him in charge, and next morning I went on board the Comet; his bag was produced, and under some dirty clothes in it were four parcels of trimmings, which were taken from the box. The trimmings in the box were similar to this. JOHN MURRANT . On the 31st, about eight o'clock at night, I took him in charge - he denied all knowledge of the parcel. Next morning Mr. Hosier gave me the bag from the Comet. The prisoner said it was his, and that he found the trimmings in a privy on the wharf, and took them on board. I asked why he did not tell Mr. Hosier he had them - he said he was only asked about feathers and flowers.MR. HOSIER. There was a considerable quantity of trimming in the box, like this, of the same pattern and fabric. Much more has been stolen than what is found. JOHN TAPSAN . I am a sail-maker, and have a loft at Miller's-wharf. On the 31st of August, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came up to my loft, and asked if I would give him a piece of tar twine to mend his waistcoat, which I did; it was twine like that the parcel is tied with. My loft is on the same floor as the warehouse. I saw him again about one o'clock on the floor under the warehouse asleep, in the very warehouse the parcel was found - he had no business there; but the boys are frequently there.

t18220911-32,kill,murder,uncategorized,none,18220911,"THOMAS CLINES and MICHAEL COIN were indicted for the wilful murder of James Murty .MESSRS. ANDREWS and LAW conducted the prosecution. MICHAEL HEENEY . On Saturday the 30th of July, I was at the Coopers' Arms, public-house. I saw Murty and Gantly there. Murty and I were taking a pot of beer - he observed that Gantly was there. Gantly came in, and Clines came in three or four minutes after. They both sat in a seat opposite to where Murty and I were. Murty continued sitting there for near five minutes, and when the pot of porter was nearly finished, he said something to me - we finished the beer, and he got up, and was going from the house - Gantly was still sitting, but as soon as Murty rose, and walked towards the passage, as if to go out (I was with him) he (Gantly) followed, and went into the bar, which is the way out. Murty stopped to take part of some beer in the tap-room - Gantly was then standing with his back to the bar; Murty would have to pass him to go out. As he passed him, Gantly immediately put up his right fist, and inflicted a wound on the left side of Murty's head; he struck him with the soft part of his hand. I saw Clines a moment after this, but not at the time the blow was struck. Murty stumbled over against the thing the gin cask stood against. Gantly laid hold of him by the right arm - Clines immediately came out of the taproom into the passage, and dragged me by the back of my neck from parting them - I was endeavouring to part them when he seized me. The blood came from the deceased's head in consequence of the first blow, and therefore I endeavoured to part them. The stillion supported him from falling. I saw several other blows inflicted. Murty kept on his legs, for he was held up by Gantly, and by the assistance of Clines. Gantly held him by the right shoulder, and Clines was behind the deceased with his two hands against his back, driving him up against Gantly, to prevent him from falling, while Gantly inflicted the wounds. Murty was struggling to disengage himself as well as he could, with his left hand; his other hand was held by Gantly - he had him by the right arm. Gantly's fist was not closed in the proper form; he had some instrument concealed in his hand - I could see about three quarters of an inch of it; it appeared to me a blunt instrument, about half an inch thick, and strait; either iron or steel - it was of a hard substance. I did not observe it after the second blow; each blow produced blood, as it was inflicted. Not a word had passed between them before the first blow. I am quite sure the deceased did not strike Gantly first. About five blows were inflicted before I went to the door and called Watch. I did not leave till it was all over, nor was I out of sight except in calling the watchman, which was only a moment - the watchman nor I could render any assistance, being unequal to them. When I returned from calling the watch, both Clines and Coin were about the deceased. I did not see Coin lay hands on him at all. I saw him drive the people back saying,""Let them, have fair play."" There was a crowd about, saying it was a shame to see the man murdered. Murty was all this time bleeding from all parts of his head - his hands were then loosened; he was in a weak state, from loss of blood, and unable to offer any resistance. He was leaning against the end of the bar. When the watchman found he could do nothing he sprang his rattle, and other watchmen came from all quarters - it was just finished when they came in; it had continued from the time the watchman went for assistance until the others came - it lasted six or seven minutes altogether I think, but cannot say particularly. I saw four or five blows then. I came in with Mahoney the first watchman, and stood at the entrance of the door, intending to secure Gantly if he came out. My mind was more upon getting assistance than noticing them. After the first four or five blows, I did not see Clines do anything; he only kept close to Murty. I could not secure Gantly, but I told the watch to keep a look out outside. I am positive Gantly did not go out at the door I stood at. One door leads into West-street, and the other leads into Sharp's-alley. When it was over there was a search for Gantly - Clines and Coin were still in the tap-room, and were taken. Before that, I went into the tap-room, and said to Clines that it was a shame to see a man murdered like the deceased was; Coin was within hearing. Clines and a strange man told me to mind my own business, and sit down. Nobody gave charge of them, for we were in search of Gantly - the deceased and I came in and gave charge of them eight or nine minutes after. I had seen Gantly and the deceased together about a fortnight before, one Sunday night; Iwas in the same public-house, and saw Gantly challenge Murty to fight him; they tossed for the ground, and Gantly won the toss.Q. What were they going to fight about - A. The deceased had been beat by Gantly on the Saturday night, and in about twenty minutes after I saw them in the passage scuffling, and the watchman parted them.Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. You were a friend of the deceased's - A. I had known him for several years. I went into the house after nine o'clock - the deceased afterwards came in and joined me. Gantly and Clines were opposite on the other side of the room; they could not hear what passed between us. Murty was leaving the house, and met a relation who handed him some beer - I was right behind walking after him. Gantly was in front of him with his back to the bar. Clines had not left his seat, and did not come up till Gantly struck Murty - he came behind Murty after the first or second blow. Gantly kept striking. I only saw something in his hand once, which was the second blow.Q. Did not Clines come up and say,""Let all be fair, man to man"" - A. No; he said fair play, and dragged me back as I was going to part them, seeing the blood.Q. Did not Coin come in with Rowland, the watchman - A. I saw him in the passage nearly at the finish of the fight - he was not in the tap-room. The prisoners had an opportunity to leave the house, but did not attempt.MR. LAW. Q. When Clines was behind Murty, was it visible what the effects of the blows were - A. It was - he was covered with blood, and not resisting; he tried to strike, but the blow did not fall. Mahoney was the first watchman who came in. MARY CORKER . I am between fourteen and fifteen years old. Murty was my uncle; he sometimes went to the Coopers' Arms, and I sometimes go there. When you go in at the street door, there is a long passage which leads into the tap-room; the bar is on the left hand, before you get to the tap-room. On Saturday night, the 20th of July, a little before ten o'clock, my father sent me there for my uncle; it was all quiet when I went; I found him in the tap-room, in company with the last witness - they were sitting drinking. It is an open room, not parted with boxes. I saw both the prisoners and Gantly in the room when I went in; they seemed all three of one party, not in company with my uncle. I did not know of Gantly and my uncle having any words. I told him to go home, for my father wanted him; I spoke privately to him; he answered me; I waited for him in the tap-room, and in about a quarter of an hour he got up to go. I did not hear the prisoners or Gantly interfere with him. When he got up to come away, Heeney went with him; my uncle went first, and I was with him. Gantly followed my uncle out, and some person stopped to let him have some drink, when Gantly got before him and waited. The prisoners remained in the tap-room; Gantly stood by the bar, in the passage; my uncle bid the man who gave him the beer good night, and when he got up to Gantly, Gantly said,""You did not bid me good night, you b - r,"" and then struck him a blow over the forehead; the blood came from his forehead directly. Betty Dogherty , who had been in company with Clines, and who had followed my uncle out, hollowed out that Gantly was fighting; this brought the two prisoners from the tap-room to the place; several blows had been struck before this. I could see that Gantly had something in his hand like iron; his hand was shut, so that it must have been a small thing. All the blows were struck in the same manner, and on the head; each blow appeared to produce more blood. My uncle did not fall; I screamed out Murder, and called to Mr. Lake, who was inside the bar; he did not come, but said, he did not care for my uncle, what he got, or if he got as much more. My uncle tried to get away, but Clines came and held him, and Coin came and prevented his falling. I think he received three or four blows before the prisoners came up. Clines and Gantly were both beating my uncle - Clines gave him a thump on the mouth, and as he went away kicked him, and said,""Let the b - r go, he has had enough."" My uncle was knocked down at that time. While this was going on, Heeney called for assistance, and Bridget Cahill went for the watchman; the prisoners went into the tap-room again; Gantly went backwards into the yard; there was a door there by which he could get out. My uncle was taken to the hospital about eleven o'clock. He gave no offence to Gantly or the prisoners, that I saw; he was much hurt by the blows; I cannot say whether the prisoners saw what Gantly had in his hand.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you ever examined about this since your uncle's death - A. Not by any person but the Coroner; I have not spoken to any body about it since. I am sure both the prisoners were in the tap-room when I first went in; I have often seen them having a pot of beer together. I saw the way every blow was struck; I could see the iron at the bottom part of his hand; four or five blows were struck before the prisoners came up, and his blood was flowing before they came. Heeney stood at the tap-room door all the time; my uncle and Gantly were between the tap-room and street doors; I think Heeney might have heard what Lake said; he was near enough to see Clines strike my uncle in the mouth and kick him. The prisoners were sitting quietly till Dogherty went in and said they were fighting; Heeney must have seen the prisoners sitting at the table. There were many other persons in the room.MR. ANDREWS. Q. Were you a good deal alarmed - A. Yes; my attention was principally directed to my uncle; I did not observe Heeney go to the door; a watchman came in while they were beating him. BRIDGET CAHILL . I live in West-street, West Smithfield. I was at the Coopers' Arms about ten o'clock, and saw the deceased there; Gantly and both the prisoners were also there; I stood at the bar, and saw Murty come out of the tap-room; he went towards the bar; Gantly came by him from the tap-room, and somebody offered Murty a pot to drink out of; he returned the pot, and bid the man good night; Gantly turned on his foot, and said,""You b - r, you have not bid me good night,"" and struck him over the forehead, not with his knuckles, but with the soft part of his hand; the first blow fetched blood; he struck him several times. A woman named Eliza Dogherty , who cohabits with Clines, cried out that Gantly was quarreling; Clines then came out of the tap-room; Gantly continued to strike, and Clines held Murty's hands, as far as I could see. I did not see Murty strike; Clines stood by his side, quite close to him; Murty tried to stumbleseveral times; but he was kept up by Clines; Gantly continued to beat him, and Dogherty said,""Give it him - go it."" I saw Coin in the middle of the row, at the entrance of the bar; I did not observe him do any thing; there were many people there; I saw Corker there; she was near Murty; she screamed out to the landlord to put her uncle inside the bar; he said he would not - that it served him right - that he wished he had more of it, for he had not had as much as he deserved; Coin was in the room when Corker called out.Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Have you no other name than Cahill - A. No; the man I live with is named Gavin; some people call me by that name. One Collins of Blackwall had taken me there to treat me with a pint of beer; I only went to the entrance of the bar; I was there before Gantly came out of the tap-room. Heeney came out of the tap-room, as far as the bar; I cannot say whether he came out with Murty. The tap-room door was open. Two blows were given before Dogherty sung out; then Clines came out first. I saw Coin in the midst of the row; there were so many in the room, I could not rightly tell who was there; but on looking about I saw Coin there, standing behind his back as it were; Clines struck him the last blow in the mouth with his fist. I have been at this bar seven years ago, for pawning from a ready-furnished lodging, and was confined twelve months. Murphy's head was all in a gore of blood. THOMAS SUTCH . I am a shopkeeper, and live opposite the Coopers' Arms, in West-street. On Saturday night, the 20th of July, a little past ten o'clock, I heard a noise there, and went into the bar, which is near the street door; a great number of people were there; I saw Murty with his head bleeding, among a number of people, and one in particular, beating him; he held him, I believe, with the left hand, and struck him with the other. All the blows were with the flat part of his hand. I did not see the deceased return the blows; he was standing when I saw him; he was held by the men who were striking, and apparently by the mob behind him; he bled very much in the head and face, so much so that I could not discern his features. The prisoners were there among the crowd; I think there were twenty or thirty people there; a watchman came in; I did not notice one man more active than the rest; they appeared to hold the man up; the prisoners were in the mob, apparently assisting the rest; I was not there above five minutes. I cannot say that the man who struck had any thing in his hand, but I thought he had, by the manner of his striking. I have no doubt of the two prisoners being there when the first watchman came in. I did not see any body try to prevent what was going on; I was greatly alarmed; I saw Lake in the bar; he must have seen what was going on better than I; he was near to them. After the man was rescued from the men who were beating him, I thought all was safe, and went home; he did not appear to be particularly weak; he walked very fast to the watch-house, but the blood ran from him almost like rain. I recollect Gantly's person; he was the man who struck the blows. A shutter fell in among the crowd by the scuffle; that was two minutes after I went in. DANIEL MAHONEY . I am a watchman. On the night of the 20th of July Mrs. Welch came out, calling Watch and Murder; my box is near the door. I went into the Coopers' Arms alone; I endeavoured to get to the man who was receiving the blows, but I was pushed back by many of them and overpowered. I stopped till I saw the man knocked down and then ran out and sprung my rattle; I went as far as Smithfield; I came back with assistance, and saw the man standing by himself by the bar; his head was covered with blood; he was the same man whom I had seen struck; I cannot say whether either of the prisoners were there or not. The deceased gave charge of the prisoners half an hour or twenty minutes afterwards; they were sitting in the tap-room. RICHARD ROWLAND . I am watchman of St. Sepulchre's. I heard a rattle spring, and went to the Coopers' Arms, about half-past ten o'clock; the door of the house was shut; I saw Coin standing at the door; about two minutes after the door was opened, in consequence of my orders, Coin and I went in together; there was a crowd of people in the passage; we went a little further; Coin's heels struck against a shutter, and it fell by accident. Some of them used very had language, and Coin said,""Don't ill treat the watchman; let him go on, as he is on his duty."" They made way for me; I joined the other watchmen, and we searched the house. Murty was leaning against the bar counter; we could not find the man we wanted. I saw the back door was fast and the clothes horse put against it; there is a back window through which a man might escape, and that window was open. Murty was bleeding very much; he appeared very faint when he got to the watch-house, and was sent to the hospital. ARCHIBALD DOUGLAS . I live in West-street, about three doors from the Coopers' Arms. On the 20th of July my attention was called there by the cries of Murder. I ran in, and in my hurry got between two men who seemed to be fighting; but on looking further, I found one was holding up the other with his right hand, and his left was uplifted, and now and then he hit him on the top of the head in this manner, with the fleshy part of his fist, and there was a gush of blood every time he struck. I saw this for about five minutes; I did not see the person return any blows; he could not; he attempted to fall to the ground, to avoid the blows, but the superior strength of the man who struck him prevented him. There were a good many people about; it was a confused concern altogether; I cannot speak to the prisoners. EDWARD EDWARDS . I lodged at the Coopers' Arms at this time. The noise brought me from the tap-room to the front of the bar; I had been in the tap-room for an hour or an hour and a half. I had not observed Gantly; I saw him go out, and saw Clines pass me going down the room. When I got to the bar, I saw Murty and Gantly fighting. There might be a dozen persons about them. Blood was flowing from Murty's head and Gantly's nose. I saw Coin come in just before the row ended; he put his hands out in the room and said,""Make room,"" or""Fair play,"" or something.Q. Then the first thing he did was to say,""Make room,"" or""Give fair play"" - A.""Make room,"" or""Give fair play,"" which I cannot be certain. I saw nothing more; that was the end of the row. I might be there for three or four minutes. I have told all I saw; I saw both men fighting; the deceased man fought as hard as he could with his fist.Q. In what manner did Gantly strike Murty - A. One man had hold of the collar by the right hand and the other by the left. The major part of Gantly's blows were directed to the head; I suppose I might see twenty or more blows; I did not count them.Q. Did you count the blows Murty gave to Gantly - A. No; he gave them so fast, I could not count them; both gave blows so fast I could not count them.Q. Did either of the blows given by Gantly produce blood from Murty - A. Of course they must. I could not see any thing in his hand; it struck me that he must have something in his hand; I am a carpenter, and out of work at present.MR. BOLLAND. Q. Coin came in at the end of the row, and said,""Make room, or give fair play;"" was that at the time the shutter fell - A. It was not many seconds before it fell; a watchman came in at that time, and the man fell directly. I had not seen Clines drinking with Gantly; I did not see Coin till he came from the street door; and said""Make way;"" that was the first time I saw him. ELEANOR BYRNE . I was the deceased's niece. I was returning from Kingsland Road on the 20th of July, and passed the Coopers' Arms after ten o'clock; I was standing at Mr. Sutch's door, and heard a very great alarm and a noise; and when I came near, I heard Mary Ann Corker screaming out to Lake for God's sake to interfere to save her uncle's life; I know Lake's voice, and heard him say to her that he did not begrudge the deceased what he had got; he took her by the arm and shoved her away. Murty was all in a gore of blood; he was so disfigured, I did not know whether it was my uncle or brother. I attended the deceased until his death; he found himself so bad, he wished to see my mother; I said,""You don't seem so bad;"" he said,""Yes, I am bad; tell your mother I want to see her."" He said he thought he should die; that he knew he should never recover. This was two days before he died. I did not think him so much in danger. JOHN SCALEY . I live in Cloth Fair, and am a labouring man. I was at the Coopers' Arms when this happened; I got there about ten o'clock - I had just got in at the door when the affray began. I knew Gantly and the prisoners before by sight; as I entered the door, I saw Gantly coming out; I turned to the bar to call for a pot of beer; I saw them both at one another, beating and striking one another with their hands - I saw blood on both of them; I did not stop to see it over. JOHN LAKE . I am the master of the Coopers' Arms.MR. LAW. My Lord, we produce this Witness in order that the Counsel on the other side may examine him if they think proper.MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect the night that this unfortunate occurrence took place - A. Yes. I was in the bar, and saw Gantly standing with his back towards the bar - I saw Murty come out of the tap-room, and in four or five minutes I saw Gantly; Murty was going out into the street, but while I was drawing a pot of beer, the affray commenced. I then saw them both striking each other. I cannot say whether either of the prisoners were present when the affray began - I saw Coin a minute or two after it began. I did not see Clines at all to my recollection. I did not see Coin in any way attempt to injure the deceased to the best of my recollection. I saw Gantly strike first. I am sure that a minute elapsed before Coin came up. I did not observe Mary Corker till the affray was over, nor ever told her I did not begrudge Murty getting twice as much, or anything like it, nor seize her arm, and shove her out of the door. JOHN HARKER . I am street-keeper of Smithfield. I knew Murty; he worked for Mr. Cressey, and was a very healthy active man. I have seen both the prisoners before - I do not know whether they knew Gantly. Two nights previous to this murder, I conducted the deceased home from his master's house in Smithfield, by desire of Mr. Cressey, to his lodging - he had to pass the Coopers' Arms in his way. I saw twenty or thirty people about the door. I do not know whether the prisoners were among them.MR. LOWE WHEELER . I am house surgeon of Bartholemew hospital. On the 20th of July, I examined the deceased when he was brought in. I found the upper part of his body covered with blood, and several wounds on the upper part of his head - there were ten in number, and most of them an inch in length, and two about an inch and a half, and some about one sixth of an inch deep, and about half of an inch deep going down to the bone. I found a wound near the forehead, about an inch and a half in length, on the leftside, and going to the bone; there was hair from the head within the wound, driven into the bone of the scull; these wounds could not be inflicted by the fist, but by a blunt instrument - there were distinct incisions, and not contusions. I attended him for some days. It was about twelve days before symptoms of injury within the head appeared, which were the natural causes of the blows. There was an interval in which I did not attend him. I believe the chief, though not the sole cause of his death, was the violence he received; that his death was accelerated by the wounds - it was not the proximate cause certainly; I should more properly call it the occasional cause. I believe death might probably be produced by the injury, but as I did not open the body, I am unable to say, but it decidedly must have accelerated his death.MR. BOLLAND. Q. How many days before he died did you cease to see him - A. There was an interval of twelve days between his convalescence and relapse, when I did not see him. His liver was injured, which frequently happens by a blow on the head; and that is my opinion.MR. HENRY EARL . I am assistant surgeon at St. Bartholemew Hospital. I saw the deceased on Sunday the 21st, the day following his admission. I did not particularly examine the wounds in his head, as they were bound up, and it would injure them. He did not appear labouring under any severe symptoms arising from the injury in the head at that time. I mean that he was quite sensible; about a fortnight after he altered - he always had an unhealthy appearance; no alarming symptoms appeared till the Saturday preceding his death - he had then a bilious attack, which was the consequence of the blow on the head when the patient was in a particular state. He complained of considerable pain in his head, and particularly of one wound on the left side of his head, all the rest were healed. He died on the 9th, having been trepanned on the 8th. I was present during part of the time the body was opened, and attribute his death directly to the injury he received,being previously in a bad state of health. The fracture did not extend through the scull, only the outer plate of the bone was fractured, and matter formed between the two plates, which accounted for the pain in his head. The death was produced by the injury no doubt, but in my judgment the wounds would not have ended in death if given to a perfectly healthy subject.MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you see the subject opened - A. My attention was turned to the liver, which appeared to be diseased, and that of long standing.COURT. Q. Was the injury of the liver likely to cause sudden death, or protracted - A. Protracted; he might have lived twelve months or more, but I think it was incurable. NOT GUILTY .London Jury, before Mr. Baron Graham.",notGuilty,none

There was a sow and four pigs. They were by the wall in New Gravel Lane. Smith came over, asked if I would buy them, and asked 30 s. each. Mansfield stood by. I said I thought it was too much; he then said 25 s.; I offered them 15 s.; they said I should have them, if I gave them the money; I said I thought they were stolen; he said he did not steal them, but found them on the side of the road straying, and drove them on. I informed the constable, and they were taken. JAMES JEFFERY . I am an officer. In consequence of information, on the 27th of August, I went to the Dock-hills, and found the four pigs and one sow; Mansfield was with them; they did not know me. I asked him if they were his; he said No, he was minding them for a man, and said,""Here he comes"". Smith was coming up, and asked me 30 s. each; I said I should like to know where he lived, if I bought one of him; he said at Ratcliffe Cross, and was well known there. I called the constable, and said,""Do you think the pigs worth 30 s.?"" He said it was a fair price. I turned away to consult about taking them; upon looking round again, I found the men and pigs were gone. We found them six hours after in Stepney Fields, and took them to the office, with the pigs; Sawyer claimed them.SMITH'S Defence. I never took them.SMITH - GUILTY . Aged 30.MANSFIELD - GUILTY .

In April last I became acquainted with the prisoner, by the name of Richard Mitford - he called on me first, in consequence of a letter, which I addressed to him - I was not at home. He called next day; he said he came in consequence of an advertisement about a situation, which I had replied to - he gave me his card (producing it)""Mr. Mitford, No. 9, Manchester-buildings."" He said he had not interest himself, but it was through a friend that he could procure a situation - he was merely the agent. I had several interviews with him on the subject - he requested some sort of security as a pledge of my sincerity in the transaction, provided I should obtain the situation. This did not pass at the first interview. He required that I should deposit a sum of money in the Bank, and take a post bill, payable to my order; this was the first proposition he made - he said he thought it would be the easiest mode, and attended with no expence, and would be most satisfactory to myself; as the post bill would be payable to my order, and could not get into circulation without my endorsement, and in the event of my not procuring the situation, he would return the Bank post bill to me. In consequence of this, I paid 50 l. into the bank, and took the Bank post bill in question. (Looking at a paper) All except the figures here are my writing; it is the ticket I gave to procure the bill. read. (Mrs. E. Rogerson, payable to J. L. Rogerson or order 50 l). On the evening of the day I procured the bill, he called on me. I said I objected to give the Bank post bill out of my possession, because in the event of my not getting the situation, I should have some difficulty in getting it back. He said I could have no difficulty in getting it back, because being unendorsed it could be of no use to him. I gave it to him unendorsed, and gave him no authority to endorse it. He left me, saying he would see me in a few days. This was on the first of May. I did not see him after till he was apprehended. Not seeing him according to appointment, I went to Manchester-buildings on the Monday, but could not find him. On the following day, the 7th of May, I stopped the bill. He never called after receiving the bill. I received a variety of letters on the subject (looking at some) these are them - (looking at the bill) this is the bill I gave him. I never procured any other bank post bill in my life. My name is on the back of it - it was neither written by me or my authority. My real signature is at the bottom; as having received the amount at the Bank afterwards.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was not the name of Bloomfield mentioned by the prisoner - A. In the course of casual conversation, at one interview that name was mentioned. He did not say it was through Bloomfield's interest that it was to be obtained. He only said Bloomfield was sporting his figure about the town, and he understood he was a relative of Sir Benjamin's; but never said he was to procure the situation, or that he wanted it to deposit with him.Q. Did you not place the bill in his hands as part of the consideration you was to pay him if he procured the situation - A. It was given to shew that money was forthcoming, and provided I got the situation I was to indorse it, and if not it was to be returned. I should have asked him to return it to me to be indorsed if I got the situation. I understand they frequently pass by mistake without being indorsed. I can swear to the bill by the number, Q. 2665, which I observed before I gave it him. I made a memorandum of it, but recollect it without the memorandum. I do not know that I ever took a Bank post bill before. I took the memorandum with me to the Bank to stop the bill, and may have left it there.MR. LAW. Q.

I knew him by the name of Richard Mitford . On the 7th of August I went to Quebec-street, and placed myself in a house opposite to No. 1, and saw the prisoner come out of No. 1; I followed, and overtook him turning the corner into Oxford-street, and said,""Mr. Mitford, how do you do?"" He looked at me, and said he had not the pleasure of knowing me; I said that was very odd - he certainly must recollect Mrs. Rogerson. He then begged my pardon, and said, Yes, he did recollect me. I asked why he did not come to Mr. Rogerson, according to his letters; he said he had done that which made him afraid to come to the house, and could not come, unless I promised him protection, and then he would call and pay some part of the money. I walked up as far as the corner of Orchard-street with him, and asked him for his address; he said it was not convenient to give it me, but he would call on Saturday and see Mr. Rogerson; we parted.

THOMAS ARMSTEAD . I belong to the Bank. I know that the cancels which are kept in the bag have been destroyed since the 10th of May.Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen, I beg to state, I am totally innocent of writing either the letters, the card, or any of the writing laid to my charge; I was merely an agent in the business; and the bank post bill was not in my possession half an hour before I handed it over to my employer, who kept it four or five days - it was returned to me by a man whose wife washed for me, with the indorsement on it. I asked him who indorsed it - he said Mr. Rogerson, and that he saw him. I asked if he enquired for me - he said No; and supposing it to be genuine, I paid it away. JAMES LANDER . I was servant to the prisoner in May last. I went with a message from him to Bloomfield, at a shoe shop in a passage near Clare-market, and brought him back a 50 l. bank post bill."" John L.

In lodgings at present, but I do not know the number - it is the Cobourg coffee-house. I lived a year and a half with the prisoner; he went by the name of John Charles Stracy . I did not live with him in Quebec-street - I have been there. He kept a groom, a black servant, a cook, and housemaid. I left him about two months before. I never saw the bill before Bloomfield gave it me.Q. Who put the indorsement on it you do not know - A. Yes, I saw a man indorse it.Q. Will you swear that - A. Yes, he indorsed it at the Lamb, public-house, Lamb's Conduit-street, in the parlour. Mr. Bloomfield sent me to him with it, to get it indorsed - he said I should see a gentleman in the parlour, and to ask his name; Bloomfield said it was Rogerson.Q. You was to enquire for him - A. Yes; I went and found a man in the parlour, with a pot of beer before him - I asked if his name was Rogerson; he said Yes.Q. Your master sent you to Bloomfield - A. Yes, to know if he could do any thing for him.Q. Why did you not state that you saw the bill indorsed before - A. I was rather flurried, never having been in a Court before. My master sent me to Bloomfield, to know if he could do any thing for him; Bloomfield said he wanted nothing, and asked if I was in a hurry; I said No, and he asked if I could take a Bank post bill to a gentleman to indorse, and I took it to the Lamb, to Mr. Rogerson, by Bloomfield's order. I found a gentleman in the parlour, and asked if his name was Rogerson; he said Yes, and he supposed I came from Bloomfield, and that he had been waiting some time. I gave him the bill, and he wrote on on it"" John L. Rogerson ;"" he let it lie on the table, and asked me to drink - I drank twice out of the pot of beer. He then took it up and said it was dry, and gave it me with his compliments to Mr. Bloomfield.Q. Well - A. Bloomfield had desired that when I had taken it to Rogerson and got it indorsed, I should take it back to Mr. Mitford, at his lodgings; and when I got back to Manchester Buildings, Mr. Mitford was not at home. I waited some time, and when he came in he asked how Bloomfield was; I told him he wanted nothing, but had sent him a Bank post bill for 50 l. Mr. Mitford said,""Don't talk nonsense - how is the poor fellow?"" I then gave him the Bank post bill - he looked at it on both sides, and asked if I saw Mr. Rogerson indorse it; I said I did, and drank with him. He then asked me where I saw Rogerson indorse it; I told him at the Lamb - I gave him the bill, and he put it in his pocket.Q. You have used the name of Mitford, I thought you knew him by the name of John Charles Stracy , Esq. - A. Yes; the reason he altered his name was, because he was likely to be arrested. He told me to bring him some linen on the Monday following.Q. Where to - A. To his lodgings in Manchester Buildings. This was on a Saturday in May. When I came on the Monday morning, he said Bloomfield and I were d - d rogues connected together to ruin him. I told him all I knew about it.Q. Does not your daughter live with the prisoner - A. Not that I know of.Q. Does she visit him - A. Not that I know of.Q. Where is the Cobourg Coffee-house - A. In Seymour-place, Bryanston-square; I have only been there since I left Mr. Mitford.

ELIZABETH BIRD . I live at Phoenix-place, Somers Town. In August last, Jones lived in Drummond-place, Somers Town. I understood from her that she was a widow. I had known her for about a month; she took in washing - I occasionally assisted her. On the 21st of August, at ten o'clock in the morning, I saw her at her lodging; she had two rooms on the second floor. I saw her in the front room, which was the sitting room - she said she was very poorly, and appeared so; she attributed it to the fatigue of the hot weather, and she had had a quarrel with her landlord. I stopped all day - I washed down stairs in the kitchen. Her daughter Emma brought me a message that her mother was poorly, and wished me to stop, and do as much as I could, and that her mother could not come to help me. About two o'clock, I went up stairs with a pail of water - I sat down half a minute, and heard her call out as if she was ill. She called to her daughter to fetch up Morrison, who lived below - I was then in the front room and she was in the bed room. I thought I heard her scream as if she was sick, and I went into the room where she was - I just opened the door and put my head in for a moment. I thought I heard the cry of an infant, and flew back in a moment - I heard it only once, and being so short a time I might be mistaken, as I never was at the birth of an infant. When I looked into the room she was standing by the side of the bed with one hand on the bed, and the other on the wall. I withdrew; her daughter at this time was gone down for Morrison, who lived below - the prisoner said to me,""Go go,"" as if for assistance, I ran down stairs in haste to get assistance, and by the time I got to the street door, her daughter came and said I need not call anybody - I met Morrison coming up stairs as I went down. I did not fetch assistance. In about an hour and a half her daughter fetched me up stairs, saying her mother wanted to speak to me; I went up to the bed room, she was lying on the bed with her clothes on - nobody else was in the room; I asked how she did - she said she hoped it was safe over; I asked if it was her labour, she said, Yes. I asked her if she did not want a nurse, as I would fetch one if she would let me, and she consented - I could not get the one I intended, but brought the first I met with, who was Catherine Richards . The prisoner had never told me she was in the family way - I had heard it, but never took much notice of her. When she told me it was her labour, I said that she never told me she was in that way; she said she thought I knew it, and that the people knew it where she lived before. Some blood was on the floor by the bed side, which Richards cleaned up.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You only looked into the room for a moment - A. No. I thought I heard a child cry.

I never saw the prisoner till I was sent for to assist her in a miscarriage - I went up stairs, and did not think of asking for the child; but she said there was the child, pointing it out - it was in a cloth. She said she wished it was alive; I said""Poor thing, I am afraid not. I am in the habit of dressing young children."" She said she wished it was alive, that I might dress hers, as she had looked out the baby clothes yesterday. She was lying on the bed at the time, and the child was lying on the ground in a cloth - it was dead before I got there, but was not quite cold. I fetched Mr. Wakefield, the surgeon. I never attended the birth of a child - I have had children myself. Mrs. Jones said she did not want me any more; she gave me 6 d. I saw no baby linen. I was so flurried, I did not notice what sort of cloth it was in.MR. GEORGE WAKEFIELD . I am a surgeon, and live at Somers Town. I was called in by the witness, Richards. I went into the prisoner's bed room, between three and four o'clock - she was lying on the bed. Nobody else was in the room. She said she had been delivered of a still born child, and that it was by the side of the bed. I took the child up, it was wrapped in a dirty cloth like a towel. I examined it, and found it was dead, and nearly cold. I examined it attentively, and had there been any marks of violence on it, I should have seen it.The rest of this gentleman's evidence went to describe the situation of the room, and the child, & c. which it is presumed better to omit. He could not say whether it was born alive, and if it was it might have died in delivery, or from various causes. WILLIAM HAUGHTY . I am an officer of the parish. We went to the house; I searched for baby linen, and found some in the drawer; the prisoner opened the drawer, and produced a variety of things which appeared to be baby linen. EMMA JONES . I am the daughter of the female prisoner. My father has been dead ten years; my mother has not been married since. I am sixteen years old. I did not know she was in the family way. I have brought the baby linen; I believe it was in the house at the time. I remember Bird going for assistance. Morrison, before he went into the room, told me to tell her she need not fetch any one. I had fetched him by my mother's orders; I did not see him in the room; I was not there till after the doctor came. Morrison went in; I do not think he stopped more than five minutes. I did not know that there was any baby linen in the house; I do not remember my mother having a child during my father's life. When Morrison came out, he said my mother had had a child; he is a boot and shoemaker; I never knew him practise as a midwife. ELIZABETH WYATT . I have known Mrs. Jones nearly five years. She told me about four months ago that she was in the family way, and engaged me to nurse her; she did not say when she expected to want me, nor desire me to make any preparation. I went to see her about twice after; she still appeared pregnant; the last time I saw her was about a month before she was put to bed. Nothing particular occurred. I told her, when she wanted me, if she sent I would come. I did not make any baby linen. She sent for me on the evening the child was born. I was then living at the Crown and Anchor.- PASSMORE. I am an undertaker. Morrison came to me on Thursday morning, the 22d of August; I was from home; he came again in the evening, and found me at home; he said he wanted a box for a still-born child, of which I understood him to say his wife was delivered the day previous; he said he should have been highly gratified if the child had lived. He gave me the length on a string. The box was made and taken home. NOT GUILTY .Second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice Richardson.",notGuilty,none

Stating his intent to be to disable him.THIRD COUNT. Stating his intent to be to do him some grievous bodily harm, and stating the stab to be under the left eye. MARY HOCKETT . I lived at Edmonton on the 3d of August last. The prisoner lived next door but one to me; a woman named Eastaff lived with him. On the evening of the 3d of August, about eleven o'clock, I heard a noise of people quarrelling in Adams's house. I went out, and Eastaff called out murder twice. William Edwards , who was at my house, opened the door, and ran out; I followed him; he went into the front yard of Adams's house, to Adams, who was beating the woman he lives with. Edwards went up to him, and put his hand on his shoulder, and desired him not to beat the woman; the prisoner immediately ran into his mother's house, which is next door to his own, and fetched a pitchfork, and swore he would have his bl - y eye out, and immediately stabbed the fork into his right eye and face; one prong went into his right eye; and he then went into his mother's house again. Edwards went in after him, and struck him; but before that, John Edwards took the fork from the prisoner. I went in and desired William Edwards to come out; he came out, and the prisoner took an iron bar and struck me over the head, which knocked me down senseless. I do not know what happened after that, but I was taken home insensible. As soon as William Edwards went in after the prisoner, he struck at him, and could not hit him, but fell back senseless, and was taken to my house; he was ill for a long time; the doctor attended him for a month at my house, and did not expect him to live for the first fortnight and three days; he appeared to me in great danger. The prisoner was not drunk; he had just come home from work. I never heard of his mind being at all affected. WILLIAM EDWARDS . I lodged with Hockett. On the night of the 3d of August I heard a woman cry murder. I went into the prisoner's yard, and the woman begged of me to take him off her, or he would murder her. I put my hand on his shoulder, and said,""Don't kill the woman."" I was in front of him; I gave him a little push, to separate them. He directly cried out for the fork, and ran in and fetched it; he was gone about a minute. I stood in the yard, not thinking he was going to stick me with it. He came out, and stuck me right in the face, and knocked me back some distance with it; he pushed it right into my face. One of the prongs ran in just under my eye, and went up into my brain, and the other prong went by the side of my head; it knocked me backwards against some palings. I followed him into his mother's house after the fork was taken from him. I struck at him, but did not hit him; I became insensible, and cannot say what passed. The stab gave me great pain; it went right into my brain. I was confined to my bed three weeks and three days, and was in great pain. I can see very little with the eye now; I cannot work now, for my head is bad. JOHN EDWARDS . I remember the night of the 3d of August. I followed William Edwards out of Hockett's house. I am no relation of his. I heard the cry of murder, and saw the woman down on the ground. William Edwards walked up to the prisoner, put his hand on his shoulder, and told him not to kill her, and pushed him a little way from her - not with violence - it was not a blow. Adams said something with an oath, which I did not understand, ran into his mother's house, and brought the pitchfork out and stabbed him immediately in the face. I heard it sound as if it penetrated into the head; it pushed him backwards against some paling. Edwards held his hands up, as if to save himself from farther harm, as the prisoner had drawn the fork out of him. Adams's brother came up, and tried to get the fork out of his hand, and in the scuffle the brother cried out that he was stabbed. I then made my way into the house, pushed his brother aside, and took the fork from him; I took it into Hockett's, and left it in care of his daughter. I saw William Edwards again that night; he lay down quite in a stupid state, and appeared as if he wanted to fall asleep. The eye appeared bloodshot an hour or two after, and there was a little skin off it at the corner. I did not observe that the prisoner was drunk; he was in a rage; I am certain he thrust the fork into William's eye. I did not see him again for a fortnight - his eye was nearly closed then. SARAH BONNY . I live at a place called Botany Bay. The prosecutor is my son; I saw him on the Tuesday morning after the Saturday on which this was done. I stopped with him eight days and nights; he was very ill indeed, and a little senseless, and complained very much of his head. He was not sensible for a minute together, for seven or eight days; he did not know me for some time when I went to him; he afterwards came to his senses better, and began to recover. WILLIAM STOKES . I lodge opposite the prisoner's mother. On the 3d of August I heard the quarrel, and ranout - I saw William Edwards come out to the prisoner; the woman was lying on the ground, and he beating her. Edwards said the prisoner ought to be ashamed of himself, to use the woman so; the prisoner said,""What odds does it make to you?"" William Edwards pushed him on the shoulder, to push him away from the woman; the prisoner immediately went and fetched the fork from behind his mother's door, and said he would stop it into the man, and did so; he shoved it into his face - Edwards fell against the paling. I went in and saw no more. WILLIAM CUFFLEY . I apprehended the prisoner on the Tuesday after this affair. I brought the fork from the office. MARY HOCKETT . The fork was brought to my house. I kept it till it was delivered to Cuffley.Prisoner's Defence. I had worked over hours, and my master gave me ale instead of money. I left work, and found some young men dancing with the woman I live with. She jawed me and I pushed her out of the house. William Edwards came out, hit me on the left breast, and knocked me down. I picked up the fork, thinking it was a stick, and hit him, and after that he came into the house, and knelt on me, knocked me about and tore my shirt collar. I have witnesses to prove that he hit me three times before I touched him. MARY EASTAFF . The prisoner lodged at my place, and I did for him. On 3d of August he came home about half past ten o'clock. He was at work for Mr. Poisey at harvest till then. When he came in, his mother and this young man were in the house having a drop of beer.Q. They were in your house - A. No; at his mother's house. Shortly after the beer was out, they clubbed together and sent for more, and while it was drinking William and John Edwards came in and danced, and drank, and Mrs. Hockett came in and asked William Edwards if he was coming out to supper, he said, Yes; he went, and shortly after we joined to have a pint of beer a piece all round, and the prisoner asked me to lend him a pint, I refused, and shortly after he and I had a few words. He told me to go out of his mother's house. I said I would not. He shoved me out of the door, I hollowed out, but what I hollowed I do not know. I saw William Edwards come up and strike the prisoner, he shoved him down first.Q. You was then on the ground, was not you - A. Yes. The prisoner got up; William Edwards hit him and made his nose and mouth bleed, and smothered his smock frock with blood; his mother washed that, but his shirt was torn all to pieces. I don't know any more, for I turned in directly. SARAH ADAMS . I am the prisoner's mother. Some people were at my house on this night; there was a quarrel between Eastaff and my son; I was sent to fetch three pints of beer, and when I returned, (being fetched) I found my son laying on the ground, in the house, bleeding, and William Edwards beating him; I took hold of his collar and pushed him out of doors; his shirt was torn off his back, and there is the blood on the floor now, for I cannot get it out.Q. You saw nothing of the pitchfork - A. No. I produce his shirt. WILLIAM EDWARDS re-examined. I was at Mrs. Adams's for a few minutes on this night, and drank half a pint of beer, then Hockett fetched me. I had no quarrel at all with the prisoner, there was not a cross word spoken. MARY HOCKETT . I went to tell Edwards his supper was ready; he came out immediately with me, quietly, there was no quarrel at all. GUILTY - DEATH .

JOHN GODFREY . I am a labourer. On the 9th of July, about twenty minutes past ten o'clock in the morning, I went into the Robin Hood, public-house, in St. Giles's, and had half a pint of beer - I had nothing else all day. While I was there five of this party were drinking. One of them told me to sit down and take my beer. The prisoners were two of them; one of them who is not here shoved against me, and I gave way; they had seen me take out my purse to pay for the beer about two minutes before, I returned it to my right hand breeches pocket. When they shoved me, Flynn put his arm round the one who was pushing, and drew out my purse; they all five them went off, and a woman followed them out; there was a sovereign, eighteen shillings, and three-halfpence in my purse, which I have not recovered. I went to get up, and Herring said,""If I followed them, he would rip my ***** out;"" and seeing a knife in his hand I was afraid, and did not follow immediately. I saw a beadle of St. Giles's come in, and told him; and I then followed them - and saw them turn the corner and share my money. After that one of the party came up; it was neither of the prisoners; he said something - they then got away. I saw Flynn in the afternoon in St. Giles's; he was secured. Herring was taken some time afterwards. I had seen Flynn several times before, and am sure of them both.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You knew Flynn before - A. Yes, by sight. I did not know where to find him. I was as sober as I am now; I had drank nothing but a tea spoon full of beer; I only wetted my lips. I was with no girls - there was a woman at the public-house window with eggs, who said, come in; I spoke to her, but did not go in; two women followed me into the house, but were not with me. I did not speak to them, nor they to me, except to thank me for paying for a quartern of gin, which they asked me to give them. I was not a minute with them; they drank it, and away they went. Flynn followed me in and stood behind me. I had my money in my hand after the girls went out. I did not drink a drop of gin. GEORGE BASEY . I apprehended Flynn on the 9th of July, and found nothing on him. WILLIAM PRICE . I apprehended Herring in Church-lane, on the 11th of July. I found nothing on him.FLYNN'S Defence. I went in to have a pint of beer, and saw the prosecutor sitting with two girls, and a pot of beerbefore him. My little sister fetched me to breakfast - I was not in the house five minutes. There was only a parcel of women there. I went home to breakfast, and coming down Ivy-street some boys were there pulling the prosecutor about. A boy came up and said the prosecutor was robbed - I said I could not help it; he said if they had left him enough to get some tobacco, he would not have cared, and asked me for money for some.HERRING'S Defence. I did not go there till half past nine o'clock. I was taken into the office four or five days after. He said he did not think I was the lad. The patrol said,""Yes, that is the lad - he had a cut in his face."" JAMES MURPHY . I am a boot-closer, and live in Church-street. On the day Flynn was taken, I saw the prosecutor come up to the corner of George-street with two girls of the town - he appeared intoxicated. I went into the Robin Hood , after that, to see the time, and saw him with a measure of gin in his hand; he helped it out to the girls. I went home to dress to go to Chelsea. I went in again, and Flynn's sister came and asked him to go to breakfast - he was sitting outside the house on the cellar flap; he went away with her, and during his absence the prosecutor came out and said he was robbed, and supposed it was either the women in his company, or some boys, and if he could have some tobacco he should not concern himself about it. He said""I have been robbed by two d - d w - s or some of the boys."" I believe the women were inside the house at this time.COURT. Q. Did you see Godfrey go into the house - A. Yes; he went in with two girls. He was there twenty minutes or better before he came out.Q. Where were you all the time - A. Looking out of a window right opposite. The street is narrow. I was waiting for a man, who was going to Chelsea with me. I saw Flynn sitting on he cellar flap.Q. Is Flynn an acquaintance of yours - A. I do not think I have spoken two words to him in my life. I told my wife of this, and was asked to come forward and say what I had seen. WILLIAM PRICE re-examined. The prosecutor never said he did not know whether Herring was the man. FRANCIS GATES .

I took charge of him, for breaking open the box; he said he would not deny it, and we might take him and hang him, if we liked.Prisoner's Defence. I contradict that I ever acknowledged it. I took the room, having heard of a job in the neighbourhood; and in the morning when I went to work, the master said he could not employ me, which was the reason I did not return. GUILTY . Aged 29.

WILLIAM WALTON . I am in partnership with my brother Joseph Walton ; we are tallow chandlers and melters, and live in Little Britain; the prisoner was in our service as porter for fourteen years, and in consequence of suspicion I entertained, I followed him out of the warehouse at two o'clock in the afternoon of the 10th of August, as he went to dinner; he had a parcel in his hand - I stopped him, and said,""Smith, what have you there?"" he said a pair of shoes, which was correct; I said,""Have you any thing else about you?"" he said No, he had not. I put my hands to his coat and found he had. I took him back into the counting house, and took from his coat pocket one cake of soap broken in half, and concealed in an old worsted stocking; he begged pardon, and said it was the first time he had done it; it weighed two pounds ten ounces. I asked what he had done with the soap he took the night before - he denied that.Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. He expressed his contrition - A. He did.

HANNAH DEARNLEY . I am a widow, and take in needle work; I live in Queen-street, Poplar; my shawl was inside a bureau bedstead; it was safe on the 24th of July. Mrs. Breet lodges in the same house. I missed it on the 4th of August, and found it in pawn next day; the prisoner lodged in the garret - he had no business in my room. I had lent it to the carpenter of a ship on the 24th of July, to pawn; he redeemed it and sent it to me by the prisoner.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had the carpenter access to your room - A. No; he went to sea before they were stolen. SARAH BREET . I am the wife of James Breet ; I lodge on the first floor. I lost a frock and petticoat, and sheet, from a drawer that was seldom locked. I never knew the prisoner to be in my room. I did not miss them till they were found at the watch-house; they were safe on the 28th of July. JOSEPH COLTMAN . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 4th of August, at the Queen's Head, public-house; I found a key on him, which he said was the key of his box; it was brought to the watch-house; I opened it, and found the things claimed by Mrs. Breet; he said nothing about them.(Property produced and sworn to.) JOHN DODD . I am servant to Mr. Dickens, a pawnbroker at Limehouse; I have a shawl pawned for 5 s. on the 3d of August, I believe by the prisoner, but cannot be certain.Prisoner's Defence.

t18220911-55,kill,manslaughter,uncategorized,none,18220911,"JAMES NEEDHAM was charged, on the Coroner's Inquisition only, with feloniously killing and slaying John Lloyd . JOHN ALEXANDER FISHER . I am a gatekeeper of Marylebone park. On the 12th of August I was sitting outside the park railing, exactly opposite the Crescent. A lady and gentleman came from the Crescent arm in arm; they advanced about a yard on the road, and a horse and gig at full gallop came directly upon them, and struck the lady on the side of her head, knocked her bonnet off, and they both fell with great violence; and the wheel went over the gentleman's body. I turned round and saw the chaise going on without any body in it - the gentleman got out or fell out. The lady and gentleman were brought into my lodge; he appeared very much hurt. A surgeon was sent for and he was put on my bed, and was sent to the Middlesex Hospital. The affair was so sudden that I could not see who drove the gig - I could not tell whether he was driving, or whether the horses ran away with him.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You are very deaf - A. Yes; several people came over to my Lodge - Mr. Steel was among them. JOHN JONES . I am a shoemaker. On the 12th of August I was coming up the New Road, and saw a man in a gig; I do not know the man rightly, but he was very much intoxicated. The reason I think so was that every whip he gave the horse he fell from one side to the other. I saw him strike several times. He sat on one side and then on the other, and fell from one side of the chaise to the other. The horse was gallopping in a way it ought not to have gallopped. I was not close to the chaise at the moment the accident happened; it had passed when I came up; I saw the person lying on the ground, and paid more attention to that. I did not see the person in the gig get out or fall out. I carried the man to the hospital on a shutter. I held Mr. Steel's horse while he went into the lodge.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time was it - A. About a quarter past five in the afternoon. The chaise passed me near the turnpike, by the end of Portland-road; I followed it, on seeing it gallop; he galloped at a very quick pace, and he had the reins in one hand and the whip in the other, and reeled from one side to the other; but the reins were loose - he was tipsy. FRANCIS STEEL . I am a silver smith; I was riding on the day in question, and saw the deceased after the accident happened, but not before I saw the chaise come through the turnpike by Warren-street, which is four or five hundred yards from the spot. The horse was gallopping. I saw him gallop from the gate to where the accident happened; the prisoner was the driver; I did not know him before, but I saw him thrown out of the gig when the wheel went over the man's body; the horse ran up the New Road; he was leaning back in the chaise, holding the reins very tight; he had them in his left hand and the whip in his right. The chaise went zig-zag, and the whip touched the horse, but he was not striking it; the horse was going at a great rate - it appeared running away. There was only a snaffle bit in the horse's mouth, which I think was improper. He did not appear to be urging the horse on; his endeavours appeared more to keep himself in; he appeared to be in liquor; the lash of the whip fell backwards and forwards, but he was not striking. He was so tipsy after the accident, that two men held him by the arms to keep him up. He went into a public-house. I asked his name and address - he said his name was Needham, and that he lived in the Borough. He appeared very much intoxicated.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The chaise did not go in a straight direction - A. No; he leant his head quite over the back of the chaise; he was bailed and has surrendered. He did not appear injured by the fall, he had some brandy and water at the public-house. THOMAS CONSTABLE . I sell fruit at the Park gate; I saw Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd crossing, but did not see them knocked down; I saw the gig a short distance before the accident happened, it was coming along fiercely; I did not notice the driver, he held the reins with both hands, but I do not know whether he had a whip; I did not see him thrown out.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. A. You had a front view of the gig, and think he had the reins in both hands - A. Beyond a doubt.MR. THOMAS WOOD . I am house surgeon at the Middlesex hospital. The deceased was brought in there one Monday in August by Jones; his name was John Lloyd ; he had fractured several of his ribs; he lived about anhour; I opened his body, and found in addition to five ribs being fractured, a considerable quantity of blood in the chest, and also in the abdomen; a carriage driving over him might occasion this injury, and that was the occasion of his death; he spoke very incoherently; I asked his name; he could not answer so as to be understood. GRIFFITH RICE . I know the deceased, his name was John Lloyd ; I saw his corpse at the Middlesex hospital; he was a relation of mine; his wife was a laundress; he was out of a situation.Prisoner's Defence. No one can feel more sorrow from this unfortunate circumstance than I do; but no blame can justly be attributed to me; the witnesses who state I was intoxicated are wholly mistaken; I had been engaged in town till late in the afternoon, and went to see my daughter, who was visiting her father-in-law at Pentonville. I passed on, and at the end of Tottenham-Court-road the belly band broke; I endeavoured to pull up, but the horse became unmanageable, and the band flapping about increased his fright; I used every exertion to pull in, but could not succeed, and the unsteady motion of the gig shook me about, which might make the witnesses think I was beating the horse; but I was pulling the reins with both hands. I called out to the unfortunate man to get out of the road, and was almost immediately after thrown out of the gig, and no doubt the effects of the fall might make the witnesses think me intoxicated; I did every thing in my power to prevent the accident.MRS. MARIA RAWLINGS . I live at Pentonville. The prisoner's daughter was visiting at my house. He called on this day, about ten minutes before six o'clock to see her, and left just after the clock struck six; he was then perfectly sober. He drank nothing at my house. He lives at Notting Hill. RICHARD STEEL . I am a carpenter. My father was on the Coroner's Inquest. I heard the verdict from him, and then made known what I knew. I was in the New-road when the accident happened. I stood and saw the horse coming along at a furious rate, about thirty yards in front of me; I stood with my back to the rails to see it pass, and just as it came by, he called out Hoy three or four times. The deceased and his wife were at that time crossing the road, and the prisoner trying every effort to stop the horse. He sat on the seat with both reins in his hand, and I think the whip lay over the dashing iron. He had both his hands on his breast, pulling as tight as he could. I did not observe the belly band. The chaise ran on with great rapidity, and he was thrown out about three yards from where the accident happened - he appeared much hurt by the fall, as if stunned. His forehead was grazed, and the back of his hands hurt. I ran to the deceased, and some people took him from my hands - I went to assist the prisoner; he appeared perfectly sober, but quite stunned - his mind seemed to wander very much, and he staggered a little when we picked him up. ELIZA LEE . I keep a fruit stall by Regent's Crescent, close to the gate, and saw the gig pass me some distance before it came to the gentleman. I saw the gentleman in the gig, sitting with the reins in both hands, pulling as hard as he could, and the horse with his mouth wide open - the belly band was flapping about, which I think frightened the horse more. The whip was not in the prisoner's hands. JOHN KNIGHT . I saw the belly band broken. I believe the prisoner was sober. JOHN COULSON . I am porter at the lodge. I saw the gig fifty yards before the accident happened - the prisoner was pulling the horse back all he could, but it was quite unmanagable - its mouth was quite open, and the belly band hung at its legs, which frightened it. I watched him two hundred yards up the road, and saw him thrown out. I really think he was sober. FRANCIS STEEL re-examined. If the belly band had been broken, I think I must have seen it. MARY POULSON . I saw the accident. The prisoner sat in his gig, pulling with all his might, to keep the horse from going on - I only saw him pass the lodge, and did not notice the belly band. SAMUEL BISS . I am driver of a Paddington stage. I saw the prisoner in his gig, at a quarter to seven o'clock. The belly band was broken, and I lent him a chain to mend it. He appeared sober, and got into his gig again - his hand was cut. I put a man in the gig to drive him home. JOHN CARMODY . I live in the prisoner's neighbourhood. I saw him about a mile from home on this night. His head and hands were cut. I am certain he was sober. NOT GUILTY .First Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice Best.",notGuilty,none

ANDREWS conducted the prosecution. CHARLES COOPER . I am servant to Mr. Emanuel Goodhart , a sugar refiner, who lived at this time at Bromley. On the 15th of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, he went to town. His clothes were kept in the wardrobe on a shelf, in the closet - I had not seen them for some weeks. The other servants have nothing to do with them. The street door is sometimes open. Between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, I was going towards the dressing room, where I had been three hours before - I opened the door and saw somebody going from the dressing room into the water closet; I opened the door, and found the prisoner there - I seized his arm, and asked what brought him there; he said he had lemons to sell - I said it was a curious place to come to sell lemons. I found my master's clothes lying on the dressing room by the closet door, that they were kept in. They consisted of the articles stated in the indictment - they were loose just as they were taken off the shelf. He said he did not know how they came there, and begged to be let go, saying it was the first time he had done such a thing. They were not lying there when I was in the room before, and the closet door was shut, but I found it open.Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. You cannot swear he took them out of the press - A. No. We have five servants and a groom.COURT. Q. Were the coats good - A. Yes. They are worth more than 40 s. I am certain - I am not a good judge,but I think them worth 4 l. I found them lying down on his basket of lemons, as if they were thrown down on it. The dressing room is on the ground floor.Prisoner's Defence. Two or three things which he says are false. I was hawking lemons - I went to this house, and asked if they wanted any, nobody answered - I thought I saw some one go in at this door, so I went in to ask, and this man opened the door, and said I wanted to rob the house.GUILTY, Aged 16.Of stealing to the value of 39 s. only .

SAMUEL JONES . I was at the Castle, public-house, at Isleworth, on the night of the 1st of July, at a dance. I danced with Sarah Spruce . I am a journeyman miller, and live near Balduck, Hertfordshire; I had come to Isleworth fair, having friends there; I left the house with Spruce between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 2 d; I came up by the King's Arms public-house, and turned up Walpole-lane; I never saw her before; I went about one hundred yards up the lane, and in three or four minutes I heard some steps; I looked down the lane, and saw three men running towards me; they ran up to me, and with their heads all three drove me against the brick wall; they ran all three abreast, as if running for a wager; one of them hit me in the face with his hat; they then seized me round the middle; one held me on each side, and the middle one drew my watch from the fob, with the seal and ribbon, and 14 s.or 15 s. from my breeches-pocket; I found my pocket turned inside out; directly they did this, they ran off; I was held so tight, I could not resist; I pulled as much as I could; they robbed me in less than a minute, and ran up the lane towards Twickenham; the only blow I received was, one of them struck me with his hat; as the last man run from me, I said,""D - n you, I shall know you."" I am positive the prisoner is that man; I saw him running off with my watch, and the seal hanging down; he drew it out of my pocket; I had seen him in the public-house that night, and they were in the street just before I turned up the lane, walking at a distance from each other; I recollected the men again; I knew the dress of the others, but could not swear to them; I was sober; I had only been to two public-houses that evening; and was in a mill for two hours; I might have drank four pints of ale in all, and no spirits at all; I was quite sober, and knew what I was doing very well; I saw the prisoner's features well in the house, and noticed him as I went up the street; he was taken, I believe, on the 3d, but I had then gone into the country.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You came from home to go to the fair - A. No, on purpose to see my relations. I was perfectly sober when I was robbed; it was getting daylight; I saw them coming when they were a hundred yards off; the last man was dressed in a dark corded jacket, which looked dirty - a pair of fustian trowsers, about the same colour - and I took great notice of his complexion; he had no coat or apron on; he had a hat. I stood talking with the woman. The state of my dress prevented my following them. I should have been afraid to run after them, if I could. I saw Campbell, the constable, soon after, and told him I knew one of them, and described his dress. The constable brought the prisoner to me on the 6th of July; he was then dressed in the same jacket and trowsers as when he robbed me, but had a white smock frock over them. I never said I did not know either of the men.Q. Did you not say you fixed on the last man, because you thought him like a man you saw in the fair - A. I went up the street after I was robbed, and met a man in the street, dressed nearly the same as one of the three, and collared him; but as soon as I came to look at him, I told him I did not think he was the man. His trowsers were fulstian, but a little lighter than the prisoner's, and he was taller. I was in a fright when I stopped him. I never charged any other man. I understand the prisoner lives at Twickerham.Q. You met Spruce by accident - A. Yes; in the room, I gave her a glass of ale. I have talked with her about this two or three times. When I took the man in the town, I did not say I thought he was the last man, but thought him one of them.Q. Did you not ask her to go back and help you, because you did not know the men - A. No; I said to her,""You must know these men; and as I do not, tell me who they are."" I did not know where they lived. I know the prisoner by his face and dress.COURT. Q. When you apprehended the other man, did you take him for the prisoner, or for one of the other men - A. For one of the others. I thought the girl might know where they came from, which was the reason I asked her to assist me, but I knew the prisoner's person. SARAH SPRUCE . I live at Hounslow; I was at the Castle at Isleworth, dancing with Jones; I went out a little before him, he joined me in the street. I went up Walpole-lane with him, and had not been there five minutes, before three men came up the lane from Isleworth, running one after the other; two held Mr. Jones, while Levy robbed him. I did not see them before, one run against him with his head and two seized and held him, while the other robbed him; the prisoner is the man who robbed him. I had seen him before that day; I had a little acquaintance with him, but not much; I knew his face quite well. I had seen him that day in the fair, and also at the Castle in the evening, and had spoken to him, but was not in his company. When I walked up the street with Jones, the prisoner and two others stood outside the public-house; I did not speak to him then. Jones was as sober as possible. I am positive he is the man. After robbing him, all three took to their heels, and ran towards Twickenham; the prosecutor did not follow them, but went to a public-house to get assistance. I saw him lay hold of another man in the street, and let him go again.Cross-examined. Q. How old are you - A. Twenty-one; I have no parents. I went to the fair alone; Jones was a stranger to me till I met him. I saw the prisoner at the Castle, but was not in his company that day; he had two more men with him, whom I should not know; one wore a white smock frock; they were both Twickenham men; the prisoner lives on Twickenham Common. I was standing in the lane with Jones; two men ran against him, and Jones said,""Do you mean robbing me?"" Levy said,""I do,"" and pulled his watch out, and handed it to one of the others instantly, and then turned his pockets out. I knew Levy instantly - he wore a fustian jacket and trowsers, and a hat, but no apron.Q. Why not tell Jones you knew one of them, and where he lived - A. I did not know it would be required till I was taken before the Justice. Jones went to the Castle to look for them; when he asked if I knew them, I said, I did not think I did, he said he really thought I knew them; I said, I did not, and afterwards that I knew one.Q. Did not you give your reason for not going back with him, that you were ashamed - A. That was not the reason. I told him one was a Twickenham man - and told him the name.Q. Did he not say he did not know any of the men, and you must go with him to point them out - A. Yes, he went to look for them. I went before the Justice on Monday - the robbery was on a Tuesday. The constable says the prisoner gave himself up. I did not see him about; he called when I was out, and left word that he was innocent.COURT. Q. When Jones first asked if you knew them, you said you did not - A. Yes; I did not know that he wished to go on with it - but when he said he would. I told him directly, on the same night, and said he lived on Twickenham Common; this was before Jones applied to the constable. THOMAS WEBB . I am constable of Twickenham. On the 3d of July, I was applied to by the Isleworth constable about this. I apprehended the prisoner on Twickenham Common on the evening of the 4th of July; his person wasdescribed and his name mentioned to me; I had no difficulty in finding him. I had searched his house on the 3d, and next day about nine found him near his home; I told him he was my prisoner, and he surrendered; I understand he had been to surrender at my house on the day before. I had not seen Jones myself; he was sent for and came. Spruce was examined on the 4th, I think.Cross-examined. Q. I believe Spruce was brought up before the Monday - A. She was with the constable looking after him. East the headborough is not here; I believe he went to him also to surrender; he lived with his mother on the common. I think Spruce was not examined till Monday. The prisoner was dressed then in a smock frock. We all went before the Magistrate on the 6th. WILLIAM STELWELL . I am an officer of Isleworth. Jones applied to my fellow constable Campbell on the 2d; the robbery had happened that morning; I did not see him till he came from the country. Campbell, I, and the girl went to Twickenham Common, to find the prisoner. I believe one constable went to his mother's house; I don't know of his surrendering himself.Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask the girl his name - A. No, nor did she tell me. SAMUEL JONES re-examined. Q. Did you learn the prisoner's name from the girl that night - A. Yes; I went with the constable to her; I asked her immediately after the robbery, if she knew the men; she said she did not; I said,""I know you do;"" she said,""I don't know them all, I know one;"" I asked his name; she said Levy; that she had seen him hay-making, and he had a thumb off one hand; she did not know which. This was when I went with the constable, which was about ten or eleven on the morning of the robbery; this was the first time she mentioned the name of Levy. Campbell the constable was with me; I gave him the prisoner's name and description; and when the Magistrate's clerk sent to me, I came to Isleworth.Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it. JOHN WEST . I live at Twickenham. The prisoner lives on the common with his mother; I have known him from a child; he bore a good character; I had seen him about his business every day as usual, till he was taken. I was at the fair with him on this night, and went to the Castle with him about half past twelve, and remained in his company. We went from there home to Twickenham in the morning - we remained at the Castle till about four o'clock. Thompson was in our company till four o'clock. There were a great many people at the public-house - it was the first day of the fair. He was not out of my sight five minutes of the time. We joined his company at half past twelve o'clock - I met him as I was going home.COURT. Q. You met him - A. Yes; and hearing music at the Castle, we went in.

I asked him to find somebody who knew him, which he did, and I paid him for it - he went away directly; he said he came from Enfield Chace that morning. I had seen the man about who said he knew him.

We were examined twice, and the officers said there was no evidence against us; but at the third examination the people swore they saw us drop the things. JOSEPH WILLIAM 'S Defence.

I know that Joseph was very ill, and came in about six o'clock - he slept in a chair till eight o'clock, and then his mother persuaded him to go to bed, which he did, and I saw no more of him till Sunday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, when I heard somebody knock at my door, as I thought; I opened it, and it was Joseph coming down stairs. I asked how his head was; he said it was very bad. I saw no more till the officers came, and took him - but I do not think Joseph was out of the house. RICHARD HARRIS .

The prisoner lived servant of all work with me until Saturday, the 20th of July, and left about seven o'clock in the evening; she had lived seven months with me. I missed several things previous to her leaving; she laid the suspicion on the laundress, when I mentioned them to her, and the laundress gave up the washing in consequence of it; and after she was gone, I missed most of these things. I missed the jewellery about three days after the prisoner left - I missed two pair of gold bracelets and a necklace out of a drawer - I had lent them to my daughter to wear about Christmas, which was the last time I saw them. In consequence of missing them, I accompanied Handley and Cooper to search her box; she was then in service at the Foreign Office in Downing-street, with Mr. and Mrs. Mountain - I saw her there - she came to me at the area steps. The officers accused her of it, and we followed her immediately up into her room, and desired her to open her boxes, which she did. The officers took her boxes to the office, and they were sealed; I saw the property found there. I said nothing to induce her to confess. EDWARD JOHN HANDLEY . I accompanied Mrs. Staff to the prisoner; she ran up stairs as fast as she could, as soon as we said Mrs. Staff had missed property. We followed her up. I saw her box opened, and produce it. I found in the kitchen drawer a book and some articles ofwearing apparel. I asked if the things in the drawer belonged to her, and she said they did - Mrs. Staff claimed them. I asked her whether the bracelets and necklace I found in her box belonged to her; she said they were given her by a young man who was dead, and she was in mourning for him - and a piece of poplin and a piece of silk she said were bought in Bond-street; but Mrs. Staff had given me two patterns with which they corresponded. She said the wearing apparel was her own, but Mrs. Staff claimed it. She was taken before the Magistrate and examined twice - I cannot be positive whether what she said was taken down or not.MRS. STAFF. The bracelets match exactly with an earring I have brought with me - I swear they are mine; here is a necklace and a pair of bracelets, worth 3 l. at least, they were taken out of one drawer; the wearing apparel was in twelve different places, and taken at different times.

I keep but one servant - I paid the prisoner her wages on the 20th of July.Q. Had you not sent her to borrow some money in order to pay her - A.

JOHN HARPER . I am a labouring man. On the 8th of August, I was at Edgware fair. I had just finished my work; there came a very heavy thunder-storm, and I went into a hay-shed, out of it. I had taken money for my work, at half-past one o'clock. I saw the three prisoners and another in the shed; the other man's name is Gardner. I was in the shed above an hour, or an hour and a half. They all remained there, and asked me to buy a pair of shoes of them. I said I wanted none; and asked where they got them. Gardner said, Saunders of Brentford made them, and that he had made his father's shoes for years; that his name was Gardner. I then knew his father. They said they were nearly starving, and had been in the shed all night, and had no money, and must sell their shoes. The storm being over, I was going away. Young Gardner jumped down with the shoes, and wanted me to buy them. I said I did not want them; he asked 3 s. 6 d. for them. I refused; he at last said I should have them for 18 d., and I bought them; this was the prisoner Gardner. We were all talking together; I had an opportunity of observing their persons. I went into the fair, met a friend, and went to have a pint of beer with him, at a booth; and while we were drinking, up came these four lads, and said,""Holla, old boy! give us a drop of beer."" They emptied the pot; and one of them said, they would be a pint towards another pot. I ordered a pot; the landlord brought it. I had no change, but six sovereigns. I pulled my purse out; it was narrow, and I could not get my fingers in. I shook it, and out fell the sovereigns. I paid for five pints of beer, and they paid for one. I then twisted my purse up, and put it in my watch-pocket, with the sovereigns, and put 19 s. and three-farthings into my breeches pocket; there were shillings and half-crowns amongst it. They went away; I sat there some time. I went out of the booth to ease myself, and before I could get my clothes down, I saw all four running towards me; the prisoner Gardner struck at me, and I struck at him, and the other three immediately pulled me down on my back; some fell on my legs and arms, and they shoved ahandkerchief into my mouth. I thought I should be strangled; I could not move hand or foot, or call out. They cut out my watch-pocket, where the sovereigns were, and took the silver out of my left-hand pocket, and the pair of shoes I had bought of them. It was done in five minutes. It was about ten o'clock in the evening, and was neither dark nor light. I could see them plainly, and am quite sure the prisoners are three of them. One of them said to the other,""Have you got it?"" he answered,""D - n his eyes, yes, I have."" I am certain they are the men. After they took my money, they jumped up, and away they ran; and as soon as I could catch my breath, I followed them; they ran into the fair. I searched every booth, but could not find them. I thought I would go to the hay-shed. I went and concealed myself behind the shed, and about three o'clock the three prisoners came back with three girls of the town. I laid there till daylight, then got a constable, who took them and put them in the cage - they were not searched till about eleven o'clock, when they were before the Magistrate at Edgware, and Gardner said his brother took all the money away; the Magistrate said he would send them to the house of correction for a month; his brother was not in custody. Gardner was not threatened in any way; what he said was taken down. One of them cut his fingers in cutting my pocket, and left blood on my coat. Their hands were not examined.Q. You was in their company for an hour and a half by day light - A. Yes; and they were in the booth about half an hour; it was about eight o'clock, and quite daylight; they robbed me before ten o'clock.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are you pretty well known at Edgware - A. I work at Harrow; I have a large family - they are on the parish in consequence of my being robbed - I had not a halfpenny from the parish for twelve months before. The Magistrate knew me because he knew my master. I had received 6 l. 5 s. from Mr. Gould, for cutting twelve and a half acres of beans. I had not above three pints of beer all day, and was as sober as I am now. I told Captain Anderson the Magistrate that I could swear to them, and told him the whole story, but he did not commit them on this charge; they were not searched.Q. On your oath did you not tell the Magistrate you could not swear to the two taller lads - A. I said I could swear to all four, but as to the little one I could swear to him better than the rest. I told him which was the one who struck at me, but I could not say which of them thrust the handkerchief into my mouth.Q. Will you swear you did not say you were uncertain about these two men - A. To the best of my knowledge I did not. I will not swear that I did not say so. I said they are the men who robbed me, and I will swear to them. I can swear to them, and the clothes they had on and all, and the Magistrate told me to go to Clerkenwell, and indict them - he committed them for a month, and I went and had them detained.Q. Did you not take out a warrant before another Magistrate - A. Yes; at Brentford, on the Monday, as they were to come on Friday. I went to Gardener's father to enquire about his brother as they called him - but found he was not a brother; this was nearly a month before the warrant was taken out. I did not ask the father for 2 l. to make it up, but he offered me money several times. He wanted to get me into a hobble.COURT. Q. Did you state the same story to the Magistrate at Edgware as you have now - A. No, I did not, because he would not give me leave to speak; he told me to hold my tongue. I mentioned the robbery to him. I never expressed a doubt of Gardner, for he is the man who came up and struck me. The other two and another were present. FRANCIS BOWYER . I am an officer of Isleworth. I apprehended Gardner on Monday, the 9th of September, opposite the Three Pigeons, public-house, at Brentford. I know nothing of the robbery.Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before - A. Yes, from a boy. I never knew any harm of him; he has had very good situations. The other two surrendered in the evening on hearing the charge. WILLIAM STELWELL , I am a constable of Isleworth. Harper brought a warrant to me. I went and took Gardner - he bears a good character. The other two came to my house to surrender themselves.The prisoners made no Defence. WILLIAM POWELL . I am an appraiser, and live at Brentford. I was in company with Gardner's father when the prosecutor was talking to him - it was last Sunday three weeks. I heard the prosecutor ask him for 2 l. to settle it - the father was going to give it him at first, but I persuaded him not.COURT. Q. Who mentioned it first - A. I did not hear the beginning. They had been talking about it before, and came over to the public-house to settle it. Gardner came over with the money in his hand, and I persuaded him not to settle it, as it was compounding felony. The prosecutor said he would take 1 l. then, and 1 l. in a month's time. This was at Brentford. Harper lives at Sunbury, seven miles off. WILLIAM GABBATUS . I am a shoemaker, and live at Brentford. Three weeks ago last Sunday, I heard the prosecutor say he would make it up for 1 l. now, and 1 l. in a month's time, and two securities for the money, which was refused.GARDNER - GUILTY - DEATH .

EDWARD BROWN . I am a gardner. On the 21st of August, I was at the Wheat Sheaf, public-house, near Fulham, with my wife; I was sober; I saw both the prisoners together. Cole asked for a pint of beer - the landlord refused to draw it. About five minutes after, Cole struck me on the stomach with his fist three or four times. I had never spoken to him. I had a pint pot in my hand,and got away as well as I could - he followed me and kept striking me; and whether he took my hat off, or whether it fell off, I cannot say - they went away directly. I followed them. Harris was in company with him, whether he interfered or not, I cannot say; they were both gone when I missed my hat and handkerchief, which was in it. I accompanied the officer in pursuit, and on our return we met Cole with my hat on his head; Harris was with him. When Cole saw me, he threw the hat off and ran away. I followed and took him to the office; Harris was taken also. My handkerchief was not found; I searched for it in the house - it was not dropped there. SARAH BROWN . I am the prosecutor's wife, and was with him at the public-house. I saw the prisoners there; Cole came up and struck my husband, and in the scuffle his hat was gone; he struck him two or three times - the prisoners went away immediately together. I looked for the hat in the passage, it was not there; the handkerchief was gone also. I saw the prisoners taken - there were five of them together. I saw Cole put his hand to the hat which was on his head, draw it off, and said,""Oh! D - n my eyes;"" I picked it up - he ran away; Harris stood still, and was taken. JAMES DINGLEY . I am a patrol. I assisted in taking the prisoners; Mrs. Brown gave me the hat; Cole threw it off his head, and tried to run away. Harris was six or seven yards from him - they both ran.

I am a patrol. I assisted in taking them. I saw Cole throw the hat off, saying,""Oh! G - d d - n it,"" and tried to escape - I seized him; Harris was there. Brown said he was one of them, and I took him. I cannot swear that he ran; he resisted being handcuffed. SARAH BROWN . Harris did not stir from the place where he stood. I did not see him run, if he had I think I must have seen him; he might have run while I stooped to pick up the hat.COLE'S Defence. I was returning from Parson's Green, and went in for a pint of beer; as I came out of the passage, I met an old man with his face cut, and said he had been ill used by Brown the fighting man, better known as the""Sprig of Myrtle."" I saw Brown, and asked him if he was not ashamed to strike an old man, he said No, and struck me; the landlord said it was a shame, and put me out of the house. I said it was a shame, and sat down till my wounds had done bleeding - I then went to look for my hat which had fallen off, I found one, but could not see whether it was mine or not; in about five minutes a woman threw out another hat; and in about half an hour, some people took me - they said,""That is the man who has got the hat."" I said, I had got two; they said if I would stand treat, they would take no notice of it. I refused, and one who said he was an officer, took me. EDWARD BROWN re-examined. I do not get my living by fighting. I am a gardener; they call me the""Sprig of Myrtle."" I am not a prize fighter. I swear positively that I struck no man there - he was not shut out, for I pursued after him on missing my hat.Q. Did you ever fight for a prize - A. About three months ago I fought for twenty-five guineas, and have fought before that. SARAH BROWN . I saw no man with his nose bleeding, nor heard of any man being beaten.

I saw the two prisoners going backwards and forwards in Shoe-lane; I lost sight of Hobdell, and kept my eye on Roberts, who stood by St. Bride's workhouse gate.

I ran down stairs, and close to the front door passage, I found the prisoner in the act of putting on his shoes. I asked what he did there; he said he was going by the coach at a quarter to five o'clock, and was afraid of being too late. I said, I thought all was not right, and was a great mind to give him in charge. He said, I might depend on his being no thief. I said, he should take off his coat, and he took it off. I asked if he had any money; he said, None. I said he should go back into the room, and see if any thing had happened to either of the parties. I told him to take off his bat; he did so, and I heard something rattle. He said it was only some money he had - I said,""You said you had no money."" I then let him go into the bed-room; I took his hat and coat into my bed-room, returned, and awoke the parties in the room. The first man said in his presence, that his silver was all gone except 6 d. Conway then sat up, and took his trowsers from behind the pillow, and said he had lost one sovereign, four half-crowns, and 3 s.; he had no money left. I searched the bed where the prisoner had slept alone; he had been in the room a minute or two, while I went into my own room. I found between the bolster and mattrass an old canvas purse, which he claimed. I said,""Here is money; you said you had none."" I found in it a sovereign, four half-crowns, 5 s., and five sixpences. Conway claimed them; he said I might depend on it, it was his. Behind the mattress, I also found a bunch of keys, which we had lost about five weeks before; he had lodged there twice before. The other man said the rest of the money was about the sum he had lost.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The other man did not know what he had lost - A. Not exactly. The prisoner had no watch. I found a bill in the purse, which was his. He took his shoes up to the room at night. GEORGE CONWAY . I slept in the room. I went to bed after the prisoner. I had a sovereign four half-crowns, and 3 s. loose in my trowsers pocket. I put them under my pillow. The prisoner and another person slept in the room, each in separate beds.

MARY ANN MORGAN . I am the wife of Thomas Morgan ; we live in Percy-street, Gray's Inn-road. On Saturday last, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was in Fleet-market with a lady, and am sure my pocket book was in my pocket when I went into the market; about the middle of the market I was hustled by three or four men, and the instant I got from them I missed my pocketbook. I am certain the prisoner is one of the men; he was a stranger before; he spoke to me, for I complained of their pressing on me, and he said, if I could not come there in a good temper, I had better go home. I let go my friend's arm and ran out of the market, being alarmed. I put my hand in my pocket and found it cut; my gown and petticoat were cut right down. I saw the prisoner again on the Monday, in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields - I was then alone - I was convinced he was the person; I gave no alarm. I saw him again at half-past nine o'clock that morning, at Mr. Loveday the pawnbroker's, offering some duplicates, which were part of the contents of the pocket-book. I charged him with being the person who stole my pocket-book; he denied it, but said he had found it; he held it out - I snatched it from him, and gave it to Mr. Loveday. A constable was sent for, who secured him.Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. The market was much thronged and crowded - A. Not particularly so; I found nothing unpleasant till this bustle; there might be ten or twelve round me; I was passing a butcher's shop; there was no oyster stall near. The prisoner was scuffling with the men and bustling to stop the progress of the people - he in particular pushed me about.Q. How was he scuffling with the other men - A. Boxing each other with their arms. There was nothing but duplicates and memorandums in the pocket-book. When I saw him in Queen-street, he was not pointed out to me. I had been to the pawnbroker's in Covent-garden and Long-acre, as some of the duplicates belonged to these shops, and found somebody had been there. He said he found the pocket-book. CHARLES D - LOVEDAY . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Calthorpe-place, Gray's Inn-road. I know Mrs. Morgan. On Monday morning, a little before ten o'clock, the prisoner came into one of the boxes of my shop, and presented two duplicates, which he said he wanted out; Mrs. Morgan had been in the shop two minutes before, to stop them; they were for a child's coat, earrings, and a piece of silver. Mrs. Morgan was still in the shop. I went round the passage and beckoned her out; I took her to the box door, and asked her if she knew the prisoner; she said in his bearing she knew him perfectly well; that he was the man who robbed her. I told him the prosecutrix had lost a pocket-book, and he had better give it her, as I dare say she did not wish to hurt him. He produced a pocket-book, and said he picked it up; she claimed that and the two duplicates. There were some papers in it, and another duplicate of my shop; he went to the passage-door, pretending to call a person who was with him - none came. Two officers took him.Cross-examined. Q. He came under no concealment - A. None at all.MRS. MORGAN. The duplicates are for things I pawned myself, in the name of Smith.CHERUBIM LACY. I live in Francis-street, Gray's Inn-road. I went to market with Mrs. Morgan. I noticed a scuffle and people pressing on her; and Mrs. Morgan soon after missed her pocket-book; they pressed on me at the same time. She shewed me her pocket, which was cut and slit down. I remember the features of one man, but have not seen him since. I do not know the prisoner.Cross-examined. Q. Was it in the middle of the market - A. About the middle; there were a great many round; we were close to a butcher's. I saw no oyster stall. JOHN BLAKE . I am a constable. I was going by Loveday's, and heard prosecutrix say to the prisoner, that he was the man who hustled her on Saturday evening; he said he was an honest man - that he found the pocketbook, and if she would pay him for finding it, he would deliver it up; she insisted that he was the man, and I took him. I found three silver tea, and four plated spoons, and two dessert spoons, two pair of earrings, one brooch, one ring, and one knife, and four duplicates on him. Mrs. Morgan claimed them all.MRS. MORGAN. They are all mine, and what I had pawned - and the duplicates of which were in my pocketbook; the four duplicates are mine; they had been redeemed from Turner's, Bridge-street, and Page's, in Long-acre.I lost eleven duplicates in all - two are missing, and the goods redeemed.

On the 18th of March I received seventy yards of satin from Grellet, and took it to Mr. Stanbridge, and left it in the warehouse. I went with the officer in search of the prisoner last Friday week, and found him - I neither promised or threatened him - he said he had taken the silk; and in our way to the office, he said he picked it up in the passage of Mr. Stanbridge's warehouse - one warehouse joins the house, and the other is at the bottom of the garden - it is all enclosed within one wall, and is in the parish of St. Leonard's, Shoreditch - it is all within the court-yard, and shuts in with gates.

On the 18th of March I received the satin from Miles, and made the entry of it in the book, which I produce - I put a number in the book, and marked the number and name L.M. in red chalk on the satin, and gave it out in the usual way to be dressed. It was applied for about a week after, and could not be found. The prisoner left Mr. Stanbridge's service soon after the inquiry was made about him. BENJAMIN HARROLD . I am a potato-merchant. The prisoner came to lodge with me in January. He left me about a month ago. I pressed him hard for money; he said it was not in his power to pay, but that if I chose, he would give me a piece of goods as security. I said I had rather he would leave me some of his furniture; he gave me a pawnbroker's duplicate, and went and transferred the goods, that day, into my name, and left that duplicate with the pawnbroker, and took another in my name; it was satin; he said he had taken it in part for a bad debt. I wanted him to go to the pawnbroker's with me, but he gave me a piece of paper instead. WILLIAM ATTFIELD . I am an officer. On the 5th of September, I accompanied Miles to Mitchell-street, Whitechapel, and found the prisoner there. We asked if he had any duplicates about him; he immediately produced this duplicate out of his pocket. I told him what I came about, but neither threatened or promised him; he said,""This is part of Mr. Stanbridge's property."" The duplicate was for twenty-one yards of satin, pledged for 2 l. 6 s. 6 d. He said his landlord, Harrold, had taken the ticket of the other part instead of rent. I took him to the office, went to the pawnbroker's with the ticket, and they brought the satin to the office. I found his wife and family in the greatest distress.

On the 20th of April, he pawned some satin; here is the duplicate for twenty-one yards of satin, for 2 l. 6 s., which is what he pawned on the 30th of April. (Looks at the ticket found on him.) The other ticket belongs to our house, but is not made out by me. I produce the satin it refers to. I originally received both pieces of the prisoner. The other was thirty-five yards, pawned on the 4th of April for 4 l. PETER GRELLET . I have no doubt of their being part of the piece delivered to Mr. Stanbridge; it exactly corresponds with the pattern, and there is a particularity in the selvidge, by which I know it.Prisoner's Defence. I have been a housekeeper in a very respectable way of business for a number of years; but my circumstances became embarrassed. The shortness of time prevents my obtaining gentlemen of the first respectability to my character; the prosecutor, however, can speak to my character for years. I have four children, and my wife expects to be confined every moment with a fifth. I was never charged with any offence, but distress has brought me into this situation, and I trust my great distress will in some measure tend to mitigate my sentence - and implore your mercy towards a penitent man.Eight witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.

I had a daughter ill at the time - she had gone to bed about an hour after; I had been up stairs about half an hour - I went from my room into my daughter's to get something from her drawers. I saw the prisoner about two steps from the top of the stairs, coming up; her bed room joined mine, and is up four pair of stairs; she caught by the banisters of the stairs, and made a noise as if very much agitated - she had a candle; I asked what was the matter - she said she was tired; I told her not to make such a noise. I went into my bed room, and thought I heard somebody at my door; I opened it and found she was at my daughter's door just adjoining; she said she had put out her candle, and that my daughter was giving her out a light; she went to her own room. About two o'clock in the afternoon of the next day, which was Sunday, I saw Captain Drew's writing desk; (the prisoner had gone out a few minutes before one o'clock.) The desk was in its usual place, with the lock next the window; I lifted it up andput a table cloth under it to press, and it opened. I took it into the front parlour, and locked it up in a cupboard, of which I kept the key. Captain Drew had gone out on Saturday night, and returned on Sunday morning - he was not at home many minutes - and then went out to dinner; this was before I found the desk open. I did not see him till next morning at breakfast; as I had gone to bed before he came home. I produced his desk to him exactly in the same state as I took it from the dining room table. In consequence of what passed, a Bow-street officer was sent for - he searched the servants, and all parts of the house. Miss Butler was in her bed room, and had not been down that morning; when he had searched all but her room, I went to tell her, and found her door was locked; I knocked at it, and got in in about ten minutes; I stood just within the door, and requested her to dress herself - and when she had done so, I called the officer up, and saw him search her drawer. I saw two 5 l. notes found in the rosette of the bed, at the top of the bed post - the officer took them; there was a clasp of a pocket-book found in her drawer, which I had seen in a pocket-book of hers before; she had brought it down a few days before and shewed it me. When it was found it was separate from the book, it looked like silver. I did not hear her say where she got any of the money.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you been married - A. Seven years; we have a residence at Cambden in Gloucestershire, where Mr. Cotterell resides, as his profession as a conveyancer calls him there; he is in Court now, and comes to town four or five times a-year and pays the rent, his name is Robert Dover Cotterell ; I did not look into the desk. I cannot say whether the prisoner is in the family way; she had to go up four pair of stairs to bed.Q. Had you searched the bed before the officers - A. No, I went into the room first, and when the officer took hold of the rosette, the notes rattled; he took his hand away, and I took and pressed it down, and said,""What is this rattling?"" he pulled down the rosette, and said""Notes"" - he was going to examine the other rosette at the time.Q. Had not Miss Butler complained of losing her pocket-book on Saturday night - A. Yes, and that the key of the place she kept her night clothes in, was in it. I was searched myself after the servants.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. From two o'clock, when you found the desk, was it under lock and key in your possession - A. Yes.MR. WILLIAM DREW . I am a master mariner. In August last, I boarded and lodged at Mr. Cotterell's. The prisoner boarded there at the same time. I received sixteen 5 l. Bank notes from Messrs. Grotes. I have no memorandum of my own, of the particulars. I had seven of them in my possesion on Saturday the 10th of August; I went out on that evening, and immediately before I went out, I said in the prisoner's presence that it was too much money to take out in my pocket, and I would put it in my desk - I took three sovereigns out of the notes, and put the seven notes in my desk in the dining room in her presence. A gentleman who dined with me, and was going out with me (I believe Mr. Cotterell's daughter), and a Mr. Briscoe were present. I locked my desk, and am positive I left it locked, and took the key with me - it was a common lock, and new about a week before. I came home the following day, about one o'clock, and did not look at my desk at all. I stopped at home about twenty minutes, changed my dress, and went out again - I slept out that night, and came home about eight o'clock next morning, and about nine I saw Mrs. Cotterell, who produced my desk to me from the cupboard in the other room, which was locked, and found the desk open. On laying it open, I missed my penknife; I searched further, and missed the notes from under the place where I kept the pen knife. I desired Mrs. Cotterell to call the servants up, which she did - I told her to keep them all in the parlour till I returned. I went to Bow-street, and brought an officer - all the servants and Mrs. Cotterell were searched; nothing was found on them. The desk had evident marks of being broken open. I remained below while the officer went up to Miss Butler's room. He asked Mrs. Cotterell to go up and sit in her room till he came up. Some money and Bank notes were found - they then called me into the room. She disclaimed all knowledge of the two 5 l. Bank notes found in the bed; but said the sovereigns were her own. I have heard of another 5 l. note being found.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you came home on Sunday, did you see Mrs. Cotterell - A. No, I did not see her all Sunday. MARY ANN ASHCROFT . On the 10th of August, I was servant to Mrs. Cotterell. Miss Butler was the last person up except myself - I met her on the first floor stairs, as she was going to bed; my mistress had gone to bed about half an hour. After Miss Butler went to bed she rung the bell twice very violently, and asked if I had seen her pocketbook, for she had put it on the bed, and afterwards she said she put it under the bed. She told me to look carefully for it, as she said I must have seen it if it had been moved out of the room. I am the only servant who goes up stairs - she said the keys of her drawers were in her pocketbook. I had never seen the pocket-book. She said she could not get at her night clothes for want of her keys. On the following day, as I was coming out of my mistress's room, I saw her. She said I must look for her pocketbook, for she had not a farthing of money, but what was there; this was between twelve and one o'clock. She said she had found the keys of her drawers on the carpet; but she had no money, and I must find her pocket-book. She went out before dinner, and returned between nine and ten o'clock at night. She had not been out between twelve and one.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you not find her a key - A. I got her three keys on Saturday night, and one of them opened her drawer. I recollect a bonnet being brought home for my young mistress on Saturday night. I did not hear Mrs. Butler offer to lend her any money. I looked in every part of the room for her pocketbook. JAMES ELLIS . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Monday, the 12th of August, I went to the house, to search. I produce the desk - force had been used to it at some time or other. I cannot say whether it was opened by force or not. I searched the servants as well as Mrs. Cotterell, also the boxes and rooms, but found nothing. I sent Mrs. Cotterell up to the prisoner's room, and when she gave me notice I went in and told Miss Butler that Mr. Drewhad been robbed; that I had searched the servants and lodgers, and also Mrs. Cotterel and the rooms, and requested leave to search hers - she consented. The first place I examined was the top drawer of a chest of drawers, and in that I found four parcels of money wrapped in paper, and sealed up - the prisoner opened the first paper, which contained twenty sovereigns. I have the papers of some of them, but cannot distinguish them. Part of the money was given to the prisoner. Another paper contained 20 s. in silver, and another 10 s. in silver, all in shillings; there was another with ten sixpences; there were two loose sovereigns, 4 s. in silver, and 4 d. in copper, in the same drawer - it was a single chest of drawers. She was present at the search. I saw a clasp in the drawer where the money was, which Mrs. Cotterell has since delivered me. (The clasp was here produced, which Mrs. Cotterell identified as the same she spoke of). I proceeded in my search; no person told me where to look. I did not find any thing more at that moment, but left the room, for Mrs. Cottrell to search the prisoner. After she had done this, I was called in again, and recollecting there were parts of the room I had not searched, I commenced again. I searched the bed furniture - nobody assisted me. At the foot of the bed, in the drapery, there were three rosettes - I put my hand on the one on the right hand, and felt something rattle; I felt the next, to see if they were stuffed with paper, when Mrs. Cotterell directly said,""What is that rattling in the rosettes?"" and put her hand to it, taking hold of the outside. I examined it, and took out two 5 l. Bank notes, which I marked at the time and produce; they were doubled up separately, not in any envelope. I asked the prisoner if she knew how they came there; she said she knew nothing of them, they were not hers. She said the money was her own, and she had had it by her some time, three weeks or a month; she did not say from whom she had it. The paper containing the sovereigns was a printed report, dated only a few days previous. Another 5 l. note came into my possession on the 27th of August, and I went with a Mr. Price, a surgeon of Kensington, to Tothill Fields, where the prisoner was, about it.Cross-examined. Q. She was in bed when you first went to the house - A. I understood so. She did not know I was searching the people below. I found Mrs. Cotterell in the room; I saw somebody search the bed clothes before Mrs. Cotterell went to it, but not the furniture; I stood looking at them while they moved the bed clothes. The prisoner told the Magistrate that the money was sealed up as a provision to take her to France. FRANCIS NEWCOMBE . I am clerk to Messrs. Grote and and Co. On the 26th of July I paid Mr. Drew 180 l., in eight notes of 10 l., sixteen of 5 l., and 20 l. in gold - the 5 l. notes were numbered from 17035 to 17050 inclusive, and all dated the 19th of June, 1822; they lay in regular order when paid to him - the lowest number being the top note - (looks at No. 17044, 17047, and 17048, 5 l. notes) - these are three of them; date and all correspond. I have the book in which they are entered by myself.MR. DREW. I received sixteen 5 l. notes from the banker's; I kept them in the order I took them; I paid away the eight first the day I received them, for seamen's wages; I took them regularly from the top; I paid away another on the day of the robbery; I took the outside one to pay that, but which outside I cannot say - it must have been been either No. 17043 or 17050 - I put the remaining seven in my desk, and did not miss them at all.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where had you kept them - A. They were always in my possession. I think they were in my desk till the day of the robbery, and I put them into my pocket on that day, expecting to leave town. I am sure I paid away the eight top ones, beginning with the lowest number. I paid them at the Seamen's Register-office, on the Commercial-road. I never gave two 5 l. notes to one individual. I went there straight from the banker's. GEORGE PRICE . I am a surgeon, and live at Kensington. On Sunday, the 11th of August, I sold a bottle of lavender water to the prisoner. I have no doubt of her. It was, as near as I can recollect, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; it cost 2 s. 6 d. She tendered a 5 l. note - (looking at No. 17044) - this is it. I wrote on it, No. 8, St. James's-place, St. James's-street; that was the address she gave me. She said Mrs. Gray was the person she took the note from, but that she herself lived in St. James's-place; that Mrs. Gray kept a school at Brook Green. The lavender water was in a very remarkable bottle - (looks at one) - this is it. I went with Ellis to Tothill-fields afterwards, and saw the prisoner in bed.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You do not mean to be positive to the prisoner's person - A. It is very painful to say so, but I am positive. My shop is open on Sundays. I was not told I was going to see the person who paid me the note. I gave her four sovereigns, and 17 s. 6 d. in silver, consisting of half-crowns, shillings, and about eight sixpences. JAMES ELLIS re-examined. This bottle was given me on the morning of the search; it was standing on the parlour mantle-piece. Mrs. Cotterell or the servant gave it me. HORATIO CURTIS . I am assistant to Mr. Morison, a chemist at Kensington. To the best of my belief, the prisoner is the person I saw on a Sunday in August - the latter end, I think. A gentleman called next day, about a smelling bottle which the person left behind her.MR. ADOLPHUS. I will not pursue this, my Lord. WILLIAM SEERS . I am a pastry-cook and live at Kensington. I think the prisoner was the person who was in my shop one Sunday, about a month ago - I think it was the 11th of August. She asked me to change a 5 l. note. I said I could not. She said she had been putting her little boy to school, and wanted change to go back by the stage. She was only in my shop a little time, but I think the prisoner is the person.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. What time was it - A. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening - I think it was nearly dark. ANN GRAY . I keep a school at Brook Green, for persons of the Roman Catholic persuasion. I know Mrs. Butler. I had not seen her for seven years before the 10th of August. I did not give her, or any body for her, a 5 l. note.- HODGES. I am a bootmaker, and live in Piccadilly. The prisoner came to lodge at my house on the 12th of July, and left on the 2d of August. She told meshe was going. She did not board with me. She owed me six guineas, and did not pay.The prisoner read an exceeding long defence, much of which was in so weak a tone of voice as to be quite inaudible. From what could be collected, it went to deny any knowledge whatever of the robbery - that the money found in her possession she had received from a person, but whose name, from a delicacy to the family, nothing should induce her to disclose, although promises of the prosecution being given up were made to her, if she would disclose the source from which she received it. That when the officer was searching her drawers, Mrs. Cotterell stood within a few inches of the rosette, apparently looking for her pocket book, and then directed the officers' attention to the rosette; and that she left her bed-room door open on Sunday, which was no indication of her guilt, if the property was in her possession.MRS. COTTERELL re-examined. I know the prisoner brought the bottle of lavender water home on Sunday night, and left it on the table. I put it on the mantlepiece, and gave it to the officer. I dare say her door was open on Sunday. I did not point out the rosette to the officer. MARY ASHLOCK . I saw the bottle of lavender water in her hand on Sunday evening, when I let her in. I do not know what she did with it. Her bed room door was always left open. I searched on and under the bed, in her absence on Sunday, for the pocket book, but not on the top; it has never been found.MRS. COTTERELL. The clasp produced is the one I saw on her pocket book. She brought it down one morning, saying,""See how this little rogue has broken my pocket book!"" I did not suspect that the desk was broken open; I thought Mr. Drew had left it open. The notes were not visible till the rosette was turned down; they were completely inside.- HODGES re-examined. When the prisoner left me, she owed six guineas. She had promised to pay me several times in the course of the week. JOSEPH SINGLETON . I am a porter. I brought a letter with money in it to the prisoner, about three weeks before she was taken, from Boodle's club-house.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where is your stand - A. I have an apartment. Mrs. Butler sent me to Boodle's for an answer to a letter; she then lodged at a china shop in Piccadilly. I lodged in Bury-street at that time. I will not swear it was not six weeks before she was taken up; she was three weeks at a bootmaker's, and it was about a week before that. I often went on messages for her. The letter I carried to her seemed to have both notes and money in it. I cannot swear what was in it, for I gave it her in the drawing room, and she took it into the bed room, and broke it open, but by the feel I thought so. I always went on her errands.COURT. Q. Did you feel the letter, to see if there was money in it - A. It was hard, and felt as if there was notes and money in it; it felt hard and soft, and was sealed several times round.GUILTY.

t18220911-96,theft,housebreaking,death,none,18220911,"WILLIAM READING was indicted for breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Robert Westwood , about four o'clock in the afternoon, of the 28th of July, at St. Ann, Westminster, (no person being therein) and stealing two hundred watches, value 600 l.; ten watch chains, value 20 l.; thirty seals, value 10 l.; two ear-rings, value 1 l.; twelve pins, value 12 s.; four spoons, value 18 s.; twelve thimbles, value 12 s.; ten pencil-cases, value 15 s.; six sovereigns; eight half-crowns; twenty shillings; ten sixpences, and one 10 l. Bank note , his property; and BENJAMIN SOLOMON was indicted for feloniously receiving the same, knowing them to have been stolen .MESSRS. CURWOOD and PLATT conducted the prosecution. ROBERT WESTWOOD . I am a jeweller, and live in Prince's-street, in the parish of St. Ann, Soho. On Sunday the 28th of July, about twelve o'clock, I left my house with nobody in it. I double locked the door - there is a bar which falls down beside the lock. I returned at half-past eight o'clock the same evening; it was daylight then. I found the door on the single lock, and the bar lying down on the floor - all the glass cases were open, and all the watches gone, and the cases emptied of all their contents, except trifling things. None of the gilt or steel things were taken; but all the gold. I missed about two hundred watches. I cannot say how many of the seals were taken, as my wife managed the jewellery - there were more than ten seals, and a great number of gold pins, and several silver things; also a great many gold earrings, silver thimbles, spoons, and pencil cases. All the articles taken were either gold or silver, and coral ear rings and necklaces. I missed six soverigns, a 10 l. note, and 3 l. in silver; the sovereigns were left in my till - I had marked them on Saturday night, so as to know them again, and am sure they were in my possession on Sunday morning.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was your wife out with you - A. Yes; I have found some pins, but none of the watches or seals - Reading was taken somewhere by Marlborough-street, on Monday afternoon, and on Tuesday, I went to the House of Correction with an order from the Magistrate to search him. I said,""You have a 10 l. note of mine, turn out all the papers you have;"" he had a paper in his hand, but would not give it up, but was obliged - he had a watch in his fob, I did not claim that - it was shewn to me before the Magistrate - his name was on the dial - I said, it was possible that name might be put on since the Sunday, and tried to see if it was burnt in, as many of those I lost belonged to other people, and I did not know them - I found it was burnt in; I advertised my loss, but did not state the sovereigns in the advertisement, as the officer said I was to be quiet about the note, and stop it at the bank - I did not think it necessary to advertise the sovereigns - I generally mark all my sovereigns, but the two in question I could pick out from ten thousand.Q. You have sent many sovereigns into the world with the same mark - A. Not with the same mark, they were marked in a particular way - I took them in the dusk of the evening, and had not an opportunity of looking at them by daylight till Sunday morning.Q. When he was searched at the House of Correction, were not the six sovereigns taken from him produced - A.Only five were produced - they were not returned to him to my knowledge - they were produced before the Magistrate on the Thursday. My wife had gone to Deptford on Saturday night, and I went to her on Sunday, and left the house securely fastened. I have no servant, as the house is too small to keep one.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do not you keep any servant - A. Yes; in the day time, my wife managed the jewellery business entirely. I marked the sovereigns as I have marked others, nearly ever since sovereigns have been in circulation; but lately I have marked them different, as I have been told there must be no gold taken off; I mark them on the edge with a pen-knife, and bruise it down again so that none is taken off.MR. PLATT. Q. Was Reading asked to give up the paper in the gaol - A. Yes; he refused, and Mr. Isaacs, his solicitor, told him not to give it up. Hassel has it; five sovereigns were taken from him at the House of Correction, six had been found on him, but he had changed one before he got there. Prince's-street is a great thoroughfare.COURT. Q. What do you mark your sovereigns for - A. To try if they are gold. GEORGE DRAKE . At the time of this robbery I lived at No. 2, Richmond-street, nearly opposite the prosecutor's house. I have known Reading from a lad, he was a play-fellow of mine - I knew him well, and cannot be mistaken in him. On Sunday the 28th of July I saw him at the corner of Upper Rupert-street, in company with four or five other men, at a few minutes after one o'clock; they were not more than fifty yards from Westwood's house - I was going home at the time, and went home, and from my window saw him in company with one of the four men - I saw them loitering about there from one o'clock till half-past four o'clock, first on one side, and then on the other, they were not all four together all the time - the last time I saw Reading he was by himself, leaning on a post. When I saw him with one of them, the other two were on the opposite side. Reading had on a brown coat and blue trowsers. I am sure of his person.Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. His mother lives in the neighbourhood - A. Yes; at the first house out of Wardour-street. ISABELLA ALLEN . I live in Richmond-street, nearly opposite Westwood's. On the Sunday afternoon that his house was robbed, about twenty-five minutes to four o'clock, I saw a young man in a brown coat come out of his house - I did not notice his trowsers, he was a short young man with a pale face, (looks at Reading,) I cannot speak to him, he is not like him in dress, but is like him in size, he came from the prosecutor's house, as if going up King-street. THOMAS FOXHALL . I am a watchman of St. Ann's, Soho, in the liberty of Westminster. About twelve o'clock on Monday the 29th of July, I took Reading in custody - he had a watch, and a seal apparently gold attached to it; I am positive that he had a seal. I took him to St. Ann's watch-house, and sent for Westwood and the constable, who examined him in my presence, and found on him six sovereigns and 2 s. and a silver watch - the seal was gone then. I said nothing to him about it. I am positive he had a seal, for he played with it all the way he went - it was on his ring when he entered the watch-house; and while I was speaking to one of the Watch Committee, he must have made away with it - I could not find it. We returned the sovereigns back to him; the prosecutor was not there then.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The Magistrate was sitting when you took him; why not take him to the office - A. I waited for Westwood, to know whether he was the man. The watch-house is in Dean-street, a good way from Marlborough-street. Westwood came to the office in the evening, but was not at the watch-house. Bidgood was with me when I took him. We searched the watch-house, but found no seal. I did not hear the prosecutor claim the watch found on him. He said the dialplate might be altered in a few hours. The sovereigns were returned to him at the watch-house.COURT. Q. Were the sovereigns produced to Westwood in your presence - A. Yes, at Marlborough-street he pointed out a mark on them; they were not returned to the prisoner after that. THOMAS GOOK . I am an officer. I first saw the prisoner at St. Ann's watch-house, on Monday morning about twelve o'clock. I found he had no seal on his watch, only a key; I cannot say whether the ribbon went through the key, or whether there was a ring. I asked him where the seal was gone; he said he never had any on. I searched him minutely, but found none. I found six sovereigns and 2 s. on him; I returned the sovereigns to him, and he changed one in the watch-house. WILLIAM HASSELL . I am clerk at the House of Correction; the prosecutor brought down an order for Reading to be searched - and he was searched in my presence; five sovereigns and a watch were found on him. Westwood said the sovereigns were his - he said they had a private mark on them; he did not explain it; he was rather agitated. I was before the Magistrate on the Thursday following, and had kept the sovereigns all the time.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not the Magistrate ask what the mark was - and did he not ask to see them before he showed it - A. Yes; he claimed the whole five at the House of Correction, but was much agitated at the time, as he thought to find a 10 l. note as well. Before the prisoner was searched, he said he expected to find a 10 l. note, and some sovereigns; I do not recollect that he said how many. He pointed out two of the sovereigns at Marlborough-street.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he say at the prison that there was a mark on them - A. He said he marked all his sovereigns - but what his wife took, she did not mark; he had them in his hand when he pointed out the mark to the Magistrate. I produce them; I marked them all myself on the King's neck.MR. CURWOOD. Q. Have you any paper which you took from Reading - A. Yes; he put his hand in his pocket and took it out. I asked for it - he would not give it me for some time. I said,""Will you give it to your solicitor."" Mr. Isaacs took it, and would not give it up; but Mr. Atkins came, and then Isaacs gave it me; it is written with pencil; I copied it, but produce the original.(Original read.)""Jem, go to Sam Caxel, and he will tell you where I live;and tell Harr - to give you the purse out of drawers, and what is in her pocket, the rings on her finger, and have them somewhere that safe; be careful that nobody takes you off.""William Reading.""Directed to Jas. Reading , 3, Allen's-place, Clerkenwell. ROBERT WESTWOOD , (looking at two of the sovereigns.) Under the dragon in the milling is a small notch, more like a bruise. I can swear these are the sovereigns I marked on Saturday night, and saw safe on Sunday morning. I had marked other sovereigns, but know I had these on Saturday night after dark - and not being able to look at them well then, I looked at them on Sunday morning; they are marked in a particular place. I did not mark the others in any particular place.Q. Can you, as a conscientious man, undertake to swear they are the sovereigns you had on Saturday night - A. Yes.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You marked them before you lost them - A. Yes, I did not put another mark on them at the office - but Hassell did. I dare say I have passed hundreds, but not marked in this way, because it is only lately that I bruised them down again; if you mix them with a thousand I will pick them out.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. For the last six months you have marked sovereigns in this way - A. Yes; I do not always mark them on a particular side; these are marked under the dragon, and under the head. I will not say I have not marked others in the same place.MR. CURWOOD. Q. Your general habit of marking is by raising the gold with a penknife, and putting it down again - A. Yes; I looked at them on Sunday morning, and recollect the very place I marked them, and find the marks there; my reason for cutting them was to ascertain whether they were good gold - not in order to know them again.COURT. Q. Did you cut the others - A. I think my wife took the others; she weighs them instead of cutting them.MR. CURWOOD. Now, my Lord, we will produce our evidence against the receiver. CHARLES COPE . In August last I saw seven pins in the shop window of Mr. Green, of Oxford-street, jeweller, and knew them to be my manufacture - and what I sold to Mrs. Westwood, at two or three different times, some nine or ten months ago - and others three or five months ago - and two black ones among them. I had sold her fourteen months ago; I informed her of it, and have since seen four of them; they were on four separate cards. MARY JORDAN . I bought two pins of Mr. Green, on the 4th of September; Clements has them. THOMAS CLEMENTS . I produce them; also two which I got by executing a search warrant at Green's. MARY JORDAN . Here is a pearl one which I know, and the other is like what I gave him. CHARLES COPE . These are four of the pins I sold Westwood.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many did you make - A. Three black, twelve garnet, and six pearl. I sold her but two of the black ones. GEORGE JOHN GREEN . I am a dealer in jewellery, and live in Oxford-street. I sold two of these pins to Jordan; and two were taken from my shop; I bought them of Mr. Alexander a month or five weeks before they were taken away, which was last Thursday week.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you keep any books - A. Yes; but in this case I took no account of the purchase, as I owed him money, and gave him a bill for 10 l., which is due on the 4th of October. I do not know what date it was drawn at; he brought the pins to me in my shop - there were eight or nine of them. I gave him 2 s. each. I have dealt with him some years; he deals in furniture and jewellery - and buys goods at sales; and lives in Duke's-place, Hounsditch, but has no shop.

I sold some pins to Mr. Green six or seven weeks ago. I had them from the prisoner Solomon about twenty-four hours before. I bought between two and three dozen of him. I cannot tell what I gave for them, it is so long past. I recollect giving him a sovereign and some silver. I cannot say how much silver, or whether it was 20 s. or not.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did you do with them - A. I went to sell them immediately. Green says he bought some of me. I know I sold him pins, but cannot say they were the same I bought of Solomon. It is impossible to swear to pins.COURT. Q. Did you mix what you bought of him with others - A. Not with other pins; I had no others.Q. Did you sell Green the pins you had from Solomon - A. Yes. I sold the rest to different pawnbrokers; some to Parker of Holborn - nearly two dozen. I do not recollect what Green gave me, for he owed me something, and I took a bill of him. I have paid it away, I cannot exactly recollect who to. I have not got my book, and cannot tell the date or amount without it.Q. Pray, did you happen to be taken up as a receiver of these stolen goods - A. Yes; and at the second examination I stated that Solomon was the man I bought them of. I could not recollect at the first time. The Justice did not tell me I must produce my books.Q. Do not you remember seeing me there - A. Yes. The Justice asked if I had any books which contained an entry on this subject; I told him I did not keep an account of what I sold or bought.Q. Did he not ask you for your books, and you said the only book you kept was in Hebrew - A. I do not recollect it. I said I kept a bill-book; some entries are in Hebrew, and some in English.COURT. Q. Do you think you sold Green a dozen pins - A. It was not a dozen. HYAM ALEXANDER . I am son of the last witness - he was taken up about the pins, and after that, Solomon was taken and brought to our house. I said to him,""Don't you remember the pins you sold to my father?"" He said,""Well, and what of them?"" He was then taken to the Mansion-house, public-house, which is opposite the Mansion-house. He walked about the room there, and appeared agitated. I said,""I dare say you can recollect ofwhom you bought the pins."" He said it would take him time to recollect. He then sent a man to Winfield-street. I asked who he had sent for; he said, for a person who might recollect. His solicitor afterwards came and conversed with him; he then said he knew nothing of the pins.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had your father been examined at the Mansion-house a day or two before this - A. He was examined at Marlborough-street - my brother was in the public-house when this conversation took place, but not all the time, and the officer was in and out occasionally.COURT. Q. At the first examination, your father could not tell who he had them from - A. He could not at that moment. HANNAH ALEXANDER . Before my father was apprehended, I saw Solomon at our house. I did not notice what he said. It was five or six weeks ago, I think. He came and said,""Mr. Alexander, I have some pins for sale.""Q. I thought you said you could not recollect what he said - A. I thought you meant what he said before. I and Amelia Isaacs immediately left the room. ISAAC ALEXANDER . I was at the public-house when Solomon was in custody. I asked if he recollected selling my father these pins; he said he recollected something of the pins, and if he had the papers which he had at home, he might recollect of whom he bought them.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was your brother present - A. No. THOMAS GOOK . I know the name of the parish Westwood lives in is St. Ann, Westminster. I live in the adjoining parish.READING'S Defence.

Did that shove prevent you from protecting your property - A. It did, my Lord, it was a push. As soon as the chain broke he ran down the yard, and I followed; he was out of my sight for a moment or two, while he turned the corner; he was then secured. I am positive of him. It was about dusk. While I was pursuing him, some persons came round, pretending to inquire what had happened, and endeavoured to stop me. I drove through them, and immediately after somebody struck me a violent blow over the arm; it was very sore next day.

ALLEY and BRODRICK conducted the prosecution.The record of the conviction of Tobias Burke was put in and read.(See Sixth Session, page 371.)HENRY BUCKLER. I am short-hand writer. I remember the defendant being examined on the trial of Tobias Burke , for bigamy, in this court. I saw him sworn, and took down his evidence. In the course of his examination, the following questions were put. (Reads.)""Q. While you were there,"" (meaning at the house of James Butler , at Cashel in Ireland,)""did you ever see any ceremony of marriage performed by any body - A. None whatever."" After some farther examination, he was asked,""Q. I give you notice, that you will be contradicted if you deny this; but on the oath you have taken, did you not give your brother away - A. I did not. Q. Neither on the 11th or 12th"" (meaning 11th or 12th of June 1815) -""A. I did not. Q. Did you not give your brother away in marriage, either on the 11th or 12th, to Mary Butler - A. Never, since the day of his birth. Q. In all the time you were in Butler's house, did you see any marriage ceremony going on whatever - A. No."" JULIA BUTLER . I am the daughter of James Butler , who lived in 1818 at Cashel in Ireland. I had a sister named Mary; she was married at my father's house, in the summer of 1815, to Tobias Burke , the prisoner's brother; he was tried here for bigamy. The prisoner was present at the marriage; he gave his brother away at my father's house, in marriage to my sister, at Cashel. They were married by a Catholic priest; my sister is a Catholic.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long is it since you came to this country - A. I came last May. I believe I am about nineteen years old; my birth-day is some time in August. My parents tell me that is about my age.Q. The marriage took place in 1815 - you were then about twelve years old - A. Twelve, or upwards. The marriage was in June, in the afternoon, after dinner, about dusk - we generally dine about five. I do not think the priest dined there - he lived in the same street. I generally go to bed about ten o'clock. There was no feast, only our own family were present. There was a party next night, my sister Eliza and Mrs. Conden were present - she is rather older than Eliza. I cannot mention every body who was present; my father was there - he is dead; my two sisters; my brother-in-law O'Carney - he is dead; and there was Mrs. Stapleton, a cousin of mine.Q. Why could you not as well have told us at first that your cousin Stapleton was present - A. I did not recollect it. I have not given the subject much consideration, except that I want to get home; it is with the greatest reluctance that I appear here.Q. What claim have you and your sister put in for your expences on this and the last trial - is it not upwards of 300 l. - A. I believe it is, travelling expences, the voyage, loss of time, and all; I have been detained here since May; I mind my mother's business at home; she is in the wine and spirit trade, and deals in hides; we also retail spirits. The most respectable houses in Ireland sell retail. We were not in the public line at the time of the marriage. There was wine and punch drank. I went to bed, and the marriage was much more than an hour before that. Tobias Burke used to go to mass after the marriage - I did not know him above a week or ten days before. My sister had been to Dublin, and whether she was acquainted with him there I do not know. Mrs. Stapleton was not asked to come over here; I believe her age was about twenty at the time; she lives at Tipperary. I did not dine at the table - I might run in and out at dinner time. I do not think the priest dined there.Q. Do you expect any remuneration for what you have done here? - A. I expect the amount of my bill.MR. ALLEY. Q. The second wife's father agreed to pay the expences of you and your sister's coming here - A. Yes; we do not expect to be paid for giving evidence. My mother constantly keeps one man servant, and sometimes has five or ten employed in the gardens. I was in and out of the room at the time of the marriage; and what has happened since it took place I cannot say.Q. All you can recollect is, that you were present when your sister was married, and that the prisoner gave his brother away - A. Yes. EMMA BUTLER . I am sister to the last witness, and am now about twenty-three years old. I was present at my father's house at Cashel, when Tobias Burke married my sister - it was in June, 1815; the Reverend Dr. Wright, the Catholic priest, married them; the prisoner was present, and gave his brother away in marriage to my sister Mary, - I am positive of it.COURT. Q. Where did your sister go to live afterwards - A. At Dublin; they lived together till they had two children; I saw the prisoner frequently afterwards.Cross-examined. Q. Who was present at the marriage - A. My father and brother-in-law (Michael O'Carney), the servants, my three sisters, and I believe my mother, my two cousins (Ryan and Stapelton), and I believe Catherine Ryan ; I cannot exactly say whether it was Catherine, but there was another person named Ryan; she was twelve or thirteen years old; my sister Conden was present; she is older than I; she does not live with my mother. I do not think the marriage took place so late as seven o'clock. I knew for a week previous that it was to take place. Tobias Burke had been at our house for about a week - he came from Dublin for the purpose of being married. I expect my expences for coming here; I do not know how much - my loss of time has been very great. I believe our expences are 300 l. or 350 l.Q. Who sent to Ireland to bring you over - A. Letters brought us over; we were not subpoenaed, but understood we should be if we did not come - our business has been at a great loss, no person being able to take care of it, my mother being old. The priest did not dine there. Tobias Burke and my father sent for him. I believe I sat up till two o'clock - I don't know when Julia went to bed. There was not much drinking. Tobias and the prisoner, my father and O'Carney, sat up till four o'clock - they did not drink enough to make them drunk - I believe they were all sober on going to bed; they had wine and whiskey. I never saw Tobias at mass before the wedding, but have many times since. I believe our loss, through our coming here, will be more than 300 l.MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you examined on the last trial - A. Yes; and alter that was subpoenaed to come here; I am very anxious to get my expences, to get away; I have made frequent application to go, nothing but the subpoena has kept me here. I am certain the prisoner is the person who gave his brother away.COURT. Q. How long did Burke live with your sister,after the marriage, in Cashel - A. They stopped at our house nine or ten days; Dr. Wright and O'Carney are dead.MR. PHILLIPS addressed the Jury on behalf of the prisoner. GUILTY . Aged 35.

I think he could not die by the accident; his death might be accelerated by it - a blow on the head could not affect the liver. I think he would have died without the fight.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had not seen him before death - A. No; all the symptoms might have existed without any violence whatever; they were most probably produced by previous disease. I think it might be accelerated by the exertion of fighting.Q. But suppose he drank the greatest part of a bottle of wine, might that have accelerated his death - A. Certainly.

In the morning after my father and mother went up stairs, a knock came to the door; I went up to open it, leaving him alone in the kitchen; I then went up to call my father; I was not gone more than five minutes; when I came down, the prisoner was standing up against the drawers, with his right hand in his pocket; there was only one chest of drawers in the room. He went out of the kitchen, and a few minutes after he passed my father, and went out at the street door. I locked the kitchen door, and took the key to my mother. Nobody had been in the kitchen but him. I saw my mother give my father the key; he went down to wash his hands, and ten minutes after I heard of the money being lost.Cross-examined. Q. Had nobody else been in the kitchen - A. No; my mother had the key; there are several lodgers. SARAH FURNEAUX . I am the wife of the prosecutor; my daughter brought me the key; I gave it to my husband, and about five minutes after he came up to me and missed the money. I saw the prisoner at the watch-house when he was taken; he was neither threatened nor promised any thing. I asked him how he came to take the money - he said he did not know how it was, but he did do it - he had left the house about ten minutes before eleven o'clock.Prisoner's Defence. The lady said I had better confess and tell the truth; I said I knew nothing of it; she said,""Now do tell, and I will go for your mother - and if she will give me a pound or two at a time, I will make it up."" As to my keeping from home, I had had words with my father. Mrs. Furneaux said.""Now tell me what you mean to do - if you give me any thing at a time, I will take it."" SARAH FURNEAUX . I said no such thing.Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character. GUILTY - DEATH . Aged 18.First Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice Best.",guilty,none

I am a clergyman. I was chaplain to the Prince Regent, and live at Chelsea. In May last I saw an advertisement in the Times newspaper, in consequence of which, I went to No. 3, Whitefriars. Goddard was in the stable there. I told him I came to see the horses which had been advertised in the Times; he said,""These are the horses;"" he was cleaning them. I asked whose they were - he said they belonged to Captain Barber, of the Inniskillen dragoons; that he was his groom, and had been so two years, from the time he left Mr. Roberts, the Bank Director; he had had the care of the horses two years, during which time Captain Barber had had them - that they were sound and young horses, under age, and he was very sorry his master was going to part with them - and was only sorry he was not going with them; that his master was going abroad, which was the only reason he parted with them; that they had been regularly hunting in Warwickshire, with Lord Milton's bounds; and sometimes had been in harness; that they were half-brothers, and were both bred by Mr. Swan, of Warwickshire;he said he had been in the habit of having the care of them, and sometimes of waiting on Captain Barber as his servant, and was very sorry to leave the horses, and would be glad to go with them. I said I should want a a person to take care of them, and would consider of it. While we were in conversation, the defendant Barber came in; I said,""Is this Captain Barber?"" he (Barber) said,""I am, and these are my horses."" Goddard was present. Barber said he had had the horses two years - that they were very good and young horses, under age - the one six, and the other seven years old, and no more; that he had hunted them regularly with Lord Milton's hounds, in Warwickshire, all the last season, and had driven them. I had known Lord Milton, and we talked of him and his affairs. He said he was a man of that county himself, and that his father and family lived at Harl-lodge, Stratford; that he bought the horses of Swan, who bred them; and that they were half-brothers. He asked a hundred and ten guineas for them, and said that Goddard had been his groom for two years. I afterwards asked him Goddard's character - he said he was an excellent groom, and understood horses very well - and he would warrant the horses. I saw Goddard again next day, by appointment, to examine them, as I had not seen them out of the stable. I found him in the stable alone. My son was with me, and a rough rider. Goddard spoke in the same way about the horses - that they had never been lame, and that nothing had ever been the matter with them. I asked him what his wages had been with Captain Barber - he mentioned about thirteen guineas, and 20 l. a-year for clothes, and 12 s. or 14 s. for board wages, and more when he travelled. I said his terms were higher than I usually gave, but I should prefer a man who had been acquainted with the horses, and mentioned what I would give. Captain Barber came into the stable, and spoke in the same favourable terms of the horses - and that they were just the figure of horses I wanted. In the course of the day, I shewed him a sort of warranty which I thought it would be proper for him to send me by post, and he said he would sign that - (looking at it) - this is it. I saw him sign"" Edward Barber , Harl-lodge, Stratford-on-Avon;"" and I added to it what he said would be his address in town, until he should go to France,""No. 5, North-street, Lambeth;"" he described the defendant Goddard as an excellent servant. I said I gave 25 l., and should not object to 20 l. a year for clothes - he said he gave more. He agreed to take five guineas off the horses, and give me the horse-cloths, &c. into the bargain. I was to give him a hundred and five guineas. I saw the horses out that day, but it poured with rain, and he was afraid they would catch cold, and was anxious they should not be out long. I said I thought there appeared a little lump on the fore leg of one horse, and that he went a little stiff with it. He said on his word of honour as a gentleman and an officer, there was nothing the matter with them, or he should have told me. He said his servant frequently waited on him in company, and had regularly had the care of the horses. I said,""Upon this warrant I will have the horses"" - he said,""Then if you please to make a deposit, if it be only 5 l. so that nobody whatever shall see the horses."" A pen and ink was sent for. I wrote a draught on Messrs. Coutts and Co., for 5 l., and delivered it to him - I drew it payable to Barber, and most likely to Captain Barber. I went again next day and saw Goddard, and agreed with him to be my servant, and to accompany the horses. I was to give him twenty-five guineas a year, twenty pounds for clothes, and twelve or fourteen shillings a week board wages; unless I boarded him myself. Captain Barber came in again, and I spoke to him on the subject of his servant becoming mine - he agreed to it, and that he should accompany the horses. I asked for a pen and ink to write a draught for the remainder of the money; he said,""If you will go into my hotel, we will settle it there;"" he took me to the Sussex hotel, and asked me to take some refreshment, which I declined. I wrote the cheque for 100 l. on Messrs. Coutts and Co. I had no sooner written it, than he took it up, and said,""Well, as you have given my servant half an hour to get the horses ready - I will go and hasten him, that he may not be later - I will return almost immediately."" He took the cheque with him. I stopped half an hour; he did not return - I was tired with wating - I had some conversation with the waiter, and then went out into the stable to see for the parties - the stable was shut up, nobody could be seen. I could see neither of the defendants - the horses were found in the street with a man named Jones on them, whom I think I had seen in the stable as helper - they were opposite another hotel in the street. I mounted the horse that had a saddle on it, and Jones rode with me to Messrs. Coutts's banking-house. Barclay had left me half hour; one of the clerks said they had not paid the 100 l. cheque, but they had the 5 l. I went to a stable near my own house, and left Jones with one of the horses, while I rode to Mr. Bloxham, a veterinary surgeon of the Horse Guards, to shew him the horse I suspected. He saw it, and in consequence of what he said, I sent a letter to Barber, addressed at No. 5, North-street, Lambeth; which letter was afterwards returned by the post to me; I never received any answer from Barber; I went back to the stable, and found Jones was gone. I had him apprehended. Goddard never came into my service; I have not seen Barber since, till to-day; I parted with my cheques, depending on his honour, and on the representation of both the defendants; I advertised them, offering a reward, and went with Mason to the Red Lion yard, Tottenham Court-road, and saw Goddard leap out of a window, and run away.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You paid the draught at the second interview - A. Yes; I took my son and the rough rider. I am a little skilled in horses, but I did not particularly examine them, it was so wet a day; I do not think the rider was as experienced as I then thought; I only had them once up and down the street, and expressed a wish to have a longer trial, but I relied on his word of honour as an officer. He said he would return to me in the coffee-room immediately - I gave him the cheque about one o'clock. I kept the horses about a month, and then sent them to Tattersall's. The saddles, &c. were worth about 5 l. CHARLES BOLTON . I am a clerk at Messrs. Coutts's. Mr. Lee keeps an account there; I produce two cheques drawn by him, one of 5 l. paid on the 7th of May, and 100 l. paid on the 8th, by the entry in the book; I suppose the last was paid about two or three o'clock; I believe Barberto be the person I paid it to; it had been paid an hour and half before Mr. Lee called to stop it.CAPTAIN SAMUEL ANTHONY BLOXHAM . I am veterinary officer to the 1st regiment of Life Guards. On the 8th of May, Mr. Lee shewed me one horse, and next day I saw both - the first was lame in the fore leg, and the second lame in both fore legs - they were decidedly not recent maladies. Had they been sound, they would have been worth a hundred and forty guineas; but they were lame, and six or seven years old. I do not think any thing had been done to their mouths. There was a considerable obstruction of the limbs - the pair are not worth above forty or forty-five guineas. They frequently hunt lame horses.Cross-examined. Q. They were lame, as if they had been a good deal worked - A. Yes; they were unfit for the streets - they were grand horses, if you cut off their knees.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it a permanent lameness - A. Yes; they were not sound, nor fit, according to the warranty - they were quite unsound.The warranty was here read, describing the horses, as stated by Mr. Lee. JANE HART . I keep the house No. 5, North-street, Lambeth. The prisoner Barber did not live there in May last-he has lodged with me, and left on the 30th of March - he did not give up his lodging till the 4th of April - he came in February.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Any letters coming directed to him would have been forwarded - A. Yes. I was going to let my house, or he would have continued with me. I was to send his papers somewhere in China-row, Lambeth. He passed as Captain Barber, and had a sevant. I do not recollect seeing Goddard. I think his servant was taller and stouter than Goddard. AMBROSE PARISH . I am a clerk in the Marshal's office of the King's Bench prison. The defendant, Barber, came into the rules on the 4th of May, and remained till yesterday - he was detained for a debt of 48 l. 10 s., and was in the walls the latter part of the time - he was locked up in June. China-row is not in the rules. MATTHEW LEONARD COLEMAN , ESQ. I was in the War-office. I have searched the books, to find if there was a Captain Edward Barber in the Inniskillen dragoons, but can find no such name in this year's list. I have looked through the Inniskillen regiment, and find that one Edward Barbor was appointed in 1811, as a cornet in that regiment, and continued in the army till 1813.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You know nothing about the army in Spain, or other parts where British subjects served - A. No. Our books contain an account of every person in the service. JOHN VICKERY . I am an officer. In consequence of instructions from the prosecutor, I made several searches in May last for Captain Barber, but could hear nothing of him. I had a second warrant handed over to me, by which I found him living in the rules of the Bench.MR. ELLIOT. I keep the Red Lion, Tottenham-court road. I keep the stable yard. Goddard lived with me for sixteen months - he left me in May last. He acted as groom or servant to a gentleman whom I did not know. I have seen the gentleman come into my yard on his horse; the prisoner Barber is the person. They were with me a week and three days, with their horses, and then they went away. Goddard paid the bill. The last time I saw Barber was a fortnight or three weeks before Goddard left; they had two horses at my stable - they were never changed - not the last horses; but I believe they brought horses to me three different times - they never stopped above a week. A gentleman came to look at the horses twice. Goddard was sometimes at home, and sometimes not - he was in and out of town. Sometimes he was absent four or five days, or a week, but never longer together. He would stop at home three weeks or a month - he had no horses there. I do not know how he was employed - he was always dressed as a respectable man.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. His wife lived sixteen months with you - A. Yes. Barber never lodged with me, but has put horses up at livery with me.COURT. Q. Did Goddard tell you he was a gentleman's servant - A. I never asked him. I considered him as a groom, as he brought horses - he brought horses before he came to lodge with me. I considered Barber as his master - he called himself Captain Barber. Goddard always ordered the bills, and I made them out to Goddard.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you at home when Mason and Mr. Lee came - A. I will not say I was at home. Goddard left me because his wife wished to live in a public street. I did not see him after the officers came. I did not see him jump out of a window. JOHN BALDUCK . I am coachman to Mr. Abraham Robarts ; and have been so above nine years - and know all the grooms employed in the stables of Mr. Robarts' father, who has been dead three years. Goddard was never groom there.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How many grooms has he - A. Three; I frequented the stables of the family, and never knew Goddard.MR.

I happened to fold them up and put them in my box by mistake. GUILTY . Aged 28. Confined Six Months .Second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Common Sergeant.",guilty,none

PAULO ROSSA . (Through an Interpreter.) On Friday night, the 8th of September, I went into a public-house in Smithfield with two others, and saw the prisoner there. I asked her to have a pot of beer; she left the house first. When I came out, she followed and asked me to go with her; I said I had no money. I went into a little passage - she held me by my coat, and said I had better stop; she pulled my watch from my pocket, then said,""The watchman is coming, I must go."" I felt it was gone, and pursued her. I fell down - the watchman took her. I was sober.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You spoke English to her - A. I only understood a little. I did not give it her to hold. HENRY MORGAN . I am a patrol. I was going down Sharp's-alley, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner talking together. I desired them to go on, and as I returned, she was running towards Chick-lane. I said,""What are you running for?"" she said,""Hush!"" the prosecutor came running after her, and said she had taken his watch. I stopped her, and took it out of her pocket; she at last said she would not deliver it before she had her half-crown - he was rather in liquor.(Property produced and sworn to.)Prisoner's Defence.

t18220911-157,theft,burglary,death,none,18220911,"FRANK PURDOM , WILLIAM CORBETT , alias WATSON , JOSEPH CORBETT , alias WATSON , and JOHN WATSON , were indicted for burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Thomas Crawley , at St. Mary, Whitechapel, about ten o'clock in the night of the 30th of July, with intent to steal, and stealing, one watch, value 3 l.; fifteen sovereigns; forty crowns; eighty half-crowns; two hundred shillings, and two hundred sixpences , his property. THOMAS CRAWLEY . I rent a house in White's-yard, Rosemary-lane, in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel. On Tuesday the 30th of July, I was at home. I do not know whether my window was up or down. The window is down a gateway, on the first floor. I saw it three hours before half open. Eliza Press alarmed me about half-past nine o'clock - it was dark then, and rained. I heard there was a man up the gateway with a ladder. I went out at the side door, looked at the window, and saw a light in the room. I called out,""Is that Mary?"" nobody answered - I called again loudly, and heard a man behind outside whistle, and call""Grover;"" I looked back and saw the man; then looked at the window, and saw the back of a strange man in the room - I hollowed out Murder! that I was robbed, and that it was other people's property, and not mine. The man jumped out of the window, which is about twelve feet from the ground - I caught him in my arms, and to the best of my knowledge it was William Corbett - he struggled with me; others came to his assistance, I think two persons - they laid hold of my legs, and pulled me down, and with their assistanc he got away. I held him about a minute, and believe that to be the man (pointing to William Corbett ) - I think as far as my knowledge leads me, that he is the man. I was shoved and lugged about by them; but not struck with any violence. They all went off together, and I pursued calling Stop thief! as I ran down the yard, he looked back close to a lamp, and I saw his features, and heard money jingling in his coat pocket. They got away but were stopped that night. I saw Purdom and the two Corbetts in custody between twelve and one o'clock that night, and knew all three of them to be the men. William Corbett came out of the house, and Joseph Corbett and Purdom are the men who were outside the house, and ran away with him. I knew their persons before, they lived near me. As I returned from following them, which was in about five minutes - I found Frank Purdom standing in the yard. I seized him and said,""You are the man who formed this plan"" - he said nothing, but tried to get away - I took him into my house, and sent for a constable, who took him. He said nothing at all to it; after he was taken, I went up to the room where I had seen the man, and found my box open; there had been a silver watch, about fifteen sovereigns, about forty crown pieces, about eighty half-crowns, about two hundred shillings, and also about two hundred sixpences. The box was locked. I found it broken open, and the property gone. I had seen it three or four hours before. I found a dark lantern in it, a light. I hadlaid the money by for my brewer, who was coming on the 1st of August. I settle with him once a month; the prisoners knew that I had laid by the money for the brewer - the three Watsons had seen me take money up to the box several times - they are brothers. When I first went into the house, they were customers there. I have known them upwards of two years. I have heard them say, when the brewer's clerk came for the money, what a swag it was. I have not found either my money or watch. I had never seen the dark lantern before. On the same day before this robbery was committed, I had 35 l. in copper money, and William Watson and Purdom had been in and out, and seen me counting the money, and said, what a swag of money it was! They were coming in and out of the taproom every minute, and could see the money. As I was running down the gateway after the men, Purdom laid hold of my right wrist with his two hands, saying,""Crawley, what is the matter with you?"" I made no answer, but tried to pull myself from him; if he had not stopped me, I should have caught hold of them.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You keep a public-house in Rosemary-lane - A. Yes; it is called the Bunch of Grapes in the licence; but it is now called the Two Brewers. I caught the man in my arms, as he came from the window. Two others came and got him away. I did not see more than two - they all ran off together; it is dark under the gateway. To the best of my knowledge, William Corbett , from seeing the side of his face in the room, and his make and shape, is the man. I had a full view as I pursued. I knew them all well, and knew where the Corbetts lived.Q. After pursuing and losing sight of them, you suspected who they were - A. I knew who they were; I saw them up the gateway; I am not mistaken; I was not under the gateway when I was knocked down, and could see them; I had seen Purdom at my house once that night, and saw John Watson and Joseph Graze at the door a few minutes before the robbery standing in the doorway, and told them to go away, and not stop up the doorway; William Corbett was not in my house that night, to my knowledge; he was not in the tap-room when I was under the gateway; the persons ran round the yard which goes into Rosemary-lane; I did not see John Watson about, except a few minutes before the alarm; I never said, that I knew neither of the Watsons were concerned; nor did I tell the Magistrate that the man called Grover three times instead of once. Mine is a regular and good house, it was a bad one when I first went to it, but since I have been there I have got rid of the people who resorted there, till within the last month; Purdom has resorted there eight or nine weeks; he laid hold of my hands as I was pursuing them; I had settled with my brewer on the 4th of July, and paid him every thing, which was 100 l.; I was the first person who went into the room. I always kept the key of the box - nobody else had access to it, or knew what was in it; my servants knew money was kept there. Anybody in the back yard could see into the room, as the yard rises - part of the room is over the gateway, and the window is nearly over the gateway. I do not think the box could be seen outside - but they could see me going towards it; they saw me send the copper (which I was counting) to the brewer. I told the officers by name who to take - and went with them. ELIZA PRESS . I live with my parents in White's-yard. Crawley's house is on one side of the gateway, and my father's or the other. I know all the prisoners persons before this. I saw three or four men in the yard - Frank Purdom was one of them; this was about five minutes before the alarm. I saw nothing else. I went and told Crawley three or four men were in the yard - I went home, and directly after, as I was standing at the door, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw Frank Purdom take hold of Thomas Crawley , who was running after some men who were running away; he stopped him for about two or three minutes. Purdom was then on the other side of the way, the others were strangers to me. I picked up a hat under the gateway just by where the window is. The window was open when I went to inform Crawley, and I told him of it. I had not noticed it before that.Q. If any person jumped from it, would it be in your sight - A. No, unless I was at the back of the house. I should not see them at the front door. My father is a carman - carts are kept in White's-yard.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. After seeing somebody in the yard, you saw some persons run through the gateway; they were strangers - A. Yes, I know all the prisoners.Q. Crawley ran after the strangers, and when he returned to the gateway he met Purdom - A. Yes. Purdom touched him on the shoulder, and said,""What is the matter."" and then Crawley took him.COURT. Q. Did you see Purdom attempt to lay hold of Crawley after he came back or before - A. After; and he took him into the public-house.MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you saw the strangers run did you continue at the door till Crawley took Purdom - A. Yes. I believe he touched him but once. I think it was about ten minutes after the alarm. I could not see the persons' faces, and do not know whether they were strangers or not. SARAH PRESS . I am sister of the last witness. I remember the night of the robbery. I went out for a drop of water, and saw a man go behind a cart, in the carman's yard - I did not see anything else then, and did not know that man then. I went up stairs, and looked out of the window, and saw Frank Purdom go out of the gateway with a ladder in a direction towards the window the thieves entered. I did not see him place it anywhere. I went down stairs, and told my mother. My sister went immediately to Crawley. I had noticed the window about a quarter of an hour before, partly up. I saw nobody but Purdom that I know. I saw two men, but did not know who; they were walking backwards and forwards for about ten minutes. I heard the cry of Stop thief! afterwards, but did not look out of window. I knew Purdom before, by seeing him about for two or three weeks.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. What kind of a coat had he on - A. It was like a frock, which came down only a short way, and was tied, light knee breeches, white stockings, and shoes. The window I was at is on the first floor, over the gateway. I looked down on his head. I did not tell my sister that it was Purdom. I said it was a man; I did not know him behind the cart, but saw that itwas him when he had the ladder; it was a lightish night, and I think the moon was about half; there was light enough to distinguish a person. I could see him very well. Our window is not over the gateway - it is two doors from it. I told nobody about Purdom, till I was at Lambeth-street next morning.COURT. Q. At the office you said Purdom was the man you saw with the ladder - A. Yes.MR. PLATT. Q. Was not that after Crawley gave his evidence - A. Yes. MARY WOOD . I live in Blue Anchor-yard, close to Crawley's house. I had a weekly place at the time of the robbery in Butcher-row, Towerhill. About half-past nine I was in Mrs. Cullum's house, Blue Anchor-yard, sitting by the fire, and heard Crawley call Stop thief! I ran out directly, and saw Billy Watson run up the yard, with some others. I had known him a long time, by his living in the neighbourhood. Crawley was pursuing them - I heard money jingling in Watson's coat pocket, as he ran; it appeared to me as if there was a great deal of money, by the sound. I could not distinguish how many more there were. I told of this on the same night, and gave this account next day before the Magistrate.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was it a dark rainy night - A. It was darkish, but did not rain. The sound appeared to me to be money jingling, and not keys - I thought it was halfpence. WILLIAM SIGGERSON . I am fifteen years old next March, and live in Blue Anchor-yard, Rosemary-lane. I attend the bricklayers. I was at my father's bed room window, ten or twelve yards from the covered passage. I knew the three Watsons, by their resorting to the King of Prussia, public-house. I did not know Purdom. I saw William Watson running up the yard, and Joseph after him. (I had heard no alarm); and a little after, I saw Crawley running up, calling Stop thief! I am quite sure of their persons. Joseph said to William,""Run it, you b - r,"" three times. I told Crawley of this next day, before I went to the Justice. I did not know of the robbery till after I saw them running.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you ever been in trouble - A. Never. I cannot say they did not come out of Crawley's tap-room. ELEANOR BRITTON . I live in White's-yard, about ten yards from Crawley's. My husband is a labourer. I came out about half-past nine o'clock at night, with some beer in my hand, and Johnny Watson , the prisoner, stood on the step of Crawley's door - Frank Purdom , who had a light dress on, stood looking in at the window - I knew them before. The window is close to the yard where the carts are kept. I went in with the beer; it was wet that night; I had just pulled my coat off, and as I laid it down I heard Crawley cry out Stop thief! I went outside the court, and went over to a neighbour's house; Crawley was then running down the yard, and when he returned up the yard, he laid hold of Purdom, and took him into the house, until the officers came and took him. I heard him say,""You rascal, you are one of the thieves who have robbed me this night;"" he said,""No, Mr. Crawley don't say so, when I have been drinking in your house all the night."" About half an hour after, William Watson came up to me with a pipe in his mouth, as I stood by my landlord's door, and asked me what was the matter; he walked away and I went in.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He came up with a pipe in his month as if he had come out of a public-house - A. Yes. I was at my landlord's door, which is about five doors from my own, and nearer to Crawley's. I cannot tell which way he came.Q. Did you see anybody running before Crawley - A. No. There was a mob gathered round his door. It was rather dark, and there were a good many people about. He came back in about five minutes, having hold of Purdom; I do not think it was more than five minutes, but cannot speak to a few minutes, and will not say it was not ten minutes. I did not know Purdom before; but am sure he is the man, for I looked him full in the face, and when I saw Crawley having hold of him, I said,""Why that is the man I saw looking through your window when I came out with my beer."" I have frequently seen him pass up and down, and had seen him at Crawley's house sometimes; he was not in the house at that time, for as Crawley came back, he said to him,""Did not you take hold of my two hands, and rescue that man from me;"" Purdom said,""Do not think I have done such a thing, for I have been drinking in your house all night."" I had seen him outside looking in at the window.CATHERINE M'GREE. I live in Blue Anchor-yard. My husband is a labourer in the East India Company's service. My house is about two minutes walk from Crawley's. I know the three Watsons, but do not know Purdom. I was standing at my door, and heard the cry of Stop thief! Three men were running, and Crawley was pursuing them - Joseph Watson was one of them, the other two I could not distinguish. Crawley was crying out Stop thief! they went by my place into Rosemary-lane - I saw Joseph Watson tap one of them on the shoulder, and tell him to keep on straight.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were they running as fast as they could - A. Yes. It was a star-light night, as well as I can remember. I saw them by the light of the lamp a good distance off. I am positive of him. THOMAS CRAWLEY re-examined. When the witness Press alarmed me, I was in my door-way, between the taproom and the bar - I could not see in the tap-room room then, but I had been serving there all night.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you seen William Watson there that night - A. In the fore part of the evening he was in and out - the last time I saw him was about four or five o'clock in the skittle ground - I was in the bar; there was not above a dozen persons in the taproom. I was in the tap-room, about five minutes before the girl came. I have a parlour, but nobody was there - five or six people were in a little room at the back of the bar. MARY MAYNARD . I live in White's-yard, about five doors from Crawley's. As I was going to bed, I looked out at the back window into the cart-yard, and saw a man in a light dress - the yard is no thoroughfare - he was stooping down under a waggon, and in a few minutes after an alarm of robbery was given; I found a ladder under the waggon a few minutes after I heard of the robbery. I knew Purdom's person before; it did not strike me then that it was him, but I thought so afterwards - I attended the second I examination, and he was then dressed inthe same way as the man whom I saw in the yard; it was a light millwrights jacket, and lightish breeches; my house looked into the yard; I never saw a ladder there before that night, it appeared like a lamplighter's ladder. I have known John Watson nearly all his life; I saw him about nine o'clock, standing by Crawley's door; he went into the tap-room. I stood at the door; he came out of the tap-room, and I missed him all in a moment; he did not speak to me.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How far is your bed-room from where you saw the ladder - A. Thirty or forty yards; it was rather cloudy.Q. If you had not seen Purdom in custody, you would not have thought it was him - A. I do not know that. I do not swear to him. I can swear to his dress; as I knew him so well before, I did not give it a thought that it was him - my attention was not drawn to him then, as there was no alarm. SAMUEL MILLER . I belong to Lambeth-street office. I was sent for to take charge of Purdom; I saw the ladder found under the waggon in the cart-yard, about twenty yards from the window - it was a light ladder, and long enough to reach to the window; it might be returned to the waggon in half a minute. I went to the house of Watson's mother directly after, in Cable-street, about five minutes walk from Crawley's, and found John Watson in bed with a candle burning. I left him there, as he promised to appear next day - but he did not; he was brought by a Thames police officer to the office some days after. I had heard he was in custody a day or two after the robbery, and had not been to look after him. While we were in the room, Joseph Watson came to his mother's door, and we apprehended him; he denied any knowledge of the robbery; and said he could prove where he was - this was about ten o'clock at night. William Watson was brought into custody next morning by a constable of St. George's. All three were examined together. William Watson was not at home when I went there. I believe he lived with his mother.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You did not take John, considering that he had nothing to do in the in the robbery - A. I did not consider so at that time - he promised to come next morning, but did not. MOSES FORTUNE . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I went with Miller to Crawley's, and received Purdom in custody - he said nothing to me. I received information, and found a hat on the steps of the corner-house opposite Crawley's, very muddy. I do not know to whom it belonged.PURDOM'S Defence. (Written). On the night of the robbery, I was asleep in the furthermost box of the taproom, and had been so near an hour and a half, which the landlord well knows. Previous to this the landlord had been in pursuit of some man who he said had robbed him. Presently he rushed into the tap-room with either a sword or poker, and made a rush at me. I ran out of the room - he said I was one who had robbed him. I leave it to you to say whether I should have stopped in the room asleep if I had robbed him. WILLIAM WATSON 'S Defence. I own to being in the house from seven till near nine, drinking with two gentlemen named Payne and Knightly. THOMAS PAYNE . I am a tobacco-pipe maker, and live in Crown-court, White's-yard, Rosemary-lane. I was at Crawley's public-house on the night of the robbery - the prisoner, William Corbett , was there. I got there about half-past eight o'clock; he came in after me. I heard Crawley give an alarm of Stop thief! William Corbett was then in the tap-room, in the next settle to me. I am sure he was in the tap-room when the alarm was given.COURT. Q. When were you applied to to give evidence - A. One day last week; I knew William Corbett had been taken up for robbing the house.Q. Did you ever tell Crawley he could not be the person, for he was in the house at the time he called stop thief - A. Yes, I told Mrs. Crawley so that night; I ran to the door immediately on hearing the cry, and saw Crawley come back from towards East Smithfield; I went into the tap-room again.Q. Was William Corbett in the house then - A. No; he went out the instant the cry was raised. I believe Crawley had hold of somebody when he came back. I did not go out of the house - I was at the door five minutes - I was at the door when he came back.Q. How came you to stay so long at the door when there was a cry of thieves - A. I thought I had no business with it. I stood at the door till Crawley brought that man back.Q. And you went out the moment you heard the cry - A. Yes; William Corbett went out at the front door by the bar, which is the same door I went out at.Q. Now, on your oath, did not you see Crawley lay hold of him - A. I did not; I saw him lay hold of one young man, but he was taller; this was when he came back. He had not hold of any body till he returned; he was down almost at the bottom of the place when I went out.Q. Did you see Crawley when you first got out - A. No, he was gone; I was not acquainted with Corbett, only by seeing him in the house, I asked him to drink with me. I cannot say whether he walked or ran out; I did not look after him. They all went out together. I stopped in the house with Mrs. Crawley till twelve o'clock that night, in the same room. I saw Mr. Crawley when he went out with the officers, he returned about that time. I saw him on his return, but did not tell him William Watson was in the house.Q. How came you to tell Mrs. Crawley that night that William Corbett was in the house at the time - A. Because I thought the man innocent; he had not been charged with any thing then, but I had heard of his being taken. He ran out of the house directly. I have been subpoenaed to come here. SAMUEL MILLER . I understand William Corbett was taken that night by a constable of St. George's; but I did not hear of it till next morning.THOMAS KNIGHTLY. I am a journeyman bricklayer, and live in Shorter's rents, and work for my brother, who is a master bricklayer. I went to Crawley's house, on the night of the robbery, about seven o'clock, and was there till eleven. I have known William Corbett six or seven years; he was there that night, and called for a pipe of tobacco, and was sitting by my side at the time Mr. Crawley gave the alarm. Most of the people ran out, and I ran out close to Corbett; I went to thedoor; he ran out and I returned; I only went on the steps. There was a great crowd, and plenty of assistance, without my lending it. Payne was there, and asked William Corbett to drink. He was reading the paper when the alarm was given; I cannot say whether he went out, as there was so much bustle. I saw no more of William Corbett that night. I did not hear of his being in custody till next morning. I am as positive that he was in the house at the time of the alarm as that I stand here.Q. When you got to the door, did you see Crawley - A. No; the noise had ceased when I got to the door; I saw him return.Q. Did you see any body with him - No; when he returned, there was nobody in custody. Purdom was in the house when he returned; and he collared him, and said,""You are one of them."" I was sitting in the box at this time.COURT. Q. Then you are quite certain the landlord, (Crawley) did not bring Purdom into the house - A. Oh no; I am quite positive of that.Q. How long had Purdom been in the house before Crawley came in - A. I do not know whether he had been in two minutes scarcely; he came in of his own accord; there was a whole lot of people round him, and Crawley came in about two minutes and collared him.Q. You never saw Purdom laid hold of by any body, or brought in by any body before that time - A. No; I had seen him in the house before that time about half past eight, or just before nine o'clock - I did not see him there at the time of the robbery. When he was there, he sat up as if he was asleep - I have been intimate with William Corbett for six, seven, eight, or nine years; he used to cart bricks and rubbish for my brother. I did not see him return to the house - he paid for what he had, when it was brought; he had no beer, he only drank out of my pot - I staid there till eleven o'clock - I saw Mrs. Crawley, but was not in the same room with her. Payne sat in the next box to me; the settle was between us.Q. Did you leave him there, or did he leave before you - A. I never left him there, I am confident that he went before me.Q. Did he continue sitting in the next box with you till he left - A. I did not take notice; there was not two people in the house when I left.Q. When did you first mention William Corbett 's being in the house at the time of the alarm - A. I mentioned it the same night.Q. Did you mention it immediately after he went out - A. No; it could not be the same night, because I did not know any thing of it - I did not know that he was suspected that night; I did not talk with Payne.Q. Did not you talk about the robbery - A. Matthew Walker , who sat with me, was talking about it, but no other person. I have known Payne about three months; he said nothing to me about William Corbett .Q. How long had Corbett been drinking with you - A. He had hardly come in and got his pipe; he might have been there five minutes before the alarm; he said he had just been having his tea. I was at the office the last time Corbett was examined, and spoke to him - I was subpoenaed to come here - I saw Crawley come in after the alarm.MR. BRODRICK. Q. You say you saw Crawley come in afterwards; but at the time he came in, you say you had returned to your seat - A. Yes.Q. Could you, or not, see him come through the yard into the house - A. Oh no, I do not know whether he had any body in custody in the yard.Q. Whether he had Purdom in custody in the yard, or not, you cannot tell - A. Oh no, he had not Purdom in custody in the yard, that I know; for he took him in the house. I saw Mrs. Crawley running about from the parlour to the bar crying; Payne was not in the tap-room; whether he went out of the house or into another room I cannot say.COURT. Q. Where was Mrs. Crawley when you left - A. Serving in the bar; I cannot say that I saw Payne with her.Q. Are you quite sure Purdom came in as a free man, without any body having hold of him - A. There was no person having hold of him when he came into the house - Crawley came in, and said,""You are one of them."" WILLIAM ADAMS . I am a lapidary, and live in Cable-court; I work for Mr. Samuels of Great Prescott-treet - I know Joseph Corbett by his frequenting a public house. On the night Crawley was robbed, I was at the Hoop and Grapes, Back Church-lane, from half past eight, till about half past ten, I looked at the dial as I came out. I heard of Joseph being taken on the same night, which called my attention to it; I was at home when I heard of it. I only live across the road. The Hoop and Grapes is within a quarter of a mile, or within five minutes walk of Crawley's House. Joseph Corbett and I went to the Hoop and Grapes together that night; we had been playing a game of skittles at Crawley's, and then went to the Hoop and Grapes - we drank together there; he stopped with me till half past ten o'clock, and never left my company.COURT. Q. How long have you been acquainted with him. - A. About two years, by seeing him at public houses. We did not leave the place till half past ten o'clock - I looked at the clock.Q. Will you swear he was not in custody at half past ten o'clock - A. I am certain he was not; he lives at No. 11, Cable-court, and I live two doors from him; we walked home together, but he went into the cook's shop, to get supper. I did not go straight home. It was half past ten o'clock by the dial when we left the Hoop and Grapes; he left the house with me. I went down Well's-street, and it was about eleven o'clock when I got home. I left him going into the cook's shop, which is next door to the Hoop and Grapes - he said he was going to get his supper. I heard of his being taken up that very night. I did not go to his mother's to enquire about him. I did not hear of John being taken that night. I went to Lambeth-street at his first examination, but do not recollect that I mentioned this to any body. I was subpoenaed here on the Saturday before the Sessions.Q. When did you first mention this to anybody - A. I do not remember mentioning it to anybody.Q. You live within two doors of his mother, and knew what he was taken up for - A.

BOLLAND conducted the prosecution. EDWARD COURSEY . I am in the employ of Mr. Hugh M'Intosh, who contracts for public works. On the 18th of July he was making a floating dock at St. Leonard, Bromley; I missed four timbers that day, which had been driven for piles, and were thirty or thirty-three feet long. I searched all over Bromley for them; I found three pieces afloat by Lowe's wharf, about two miles off - I found the other by the side of a saw-pit, cut in three pieces. The prisoner was at work at it. One of the three pieces was cut into rafters - I asked who ordered him to cut it - he said he was ordered, but he did not know who by. I sent for a constable, and got one, and found him still there; but he had cut off the pieces where the hook went on, while we were gone; which was a mark by which I knew them; he said he was told to cut it off, but he did not know who by; we left him, and went down to the water side, about fifty yards off. On returning to the saw-pit, we missed the piece he had cut off; he said he did not know where it was. I gave him in charge. I can swear to the timber by a mark, and by a rope which I had put on myself, and the piece he was cutting, was marked 25 ft.; which is the depth it was to be driven into the ground. Lowe, the owner of the saw-pit, came and asked when I missed the timber? I said that morning; Lowe then said it had been there three or four days; but I had seen it safe the day before; the tide would float them up there in three or four hours.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Lowe has run away - A. Yes, the prisoner stopped doing his work. THOMAS BENFORD . I am a constable of Bromley. On the 18th, about five o'clock in the evening, I was fetched to Lowe's wharf - I found Coursey on the wharf, and the prisoner sitting on the timber; Coursey gave charge of him. I asked who employed him; he said between five and six o'clock, a stranger came down and asked if he was a sawyer, and employed him to cut that piece of timber.Cross-examined. Q. Lowe has ran away - A. After the second examination he did; the prisoner had liberty to cut for other people; he was not employed by Lowe; he did not alter the timber while I was there. Lowe was present when I apprehended him, and did not claim it.The prisoner in his defence stated, that Lowe had ordered him to cut it up. EDWARD COURSEY . He never said he had it from Lowe; but that he did not know who employed him to cut it up. - I am a sawyer. I helped the prisoner to cut a piece of this timber up; Lowe employed us about nine o'clock in the morning. I do not know where he is. I should have been on the spot when the prisoner was taken, but was gone to a funeral. NOT GUILTY .Second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Recorder.",notGuilty,none

On the 4th of September, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I and Read were going through Shepherd's Bush Common, and the prisoner passed us coming towards London. We both jumped out of the cart; Reid took the bundle from the prisoner, and asked him what was in it; he said he did not know. I put my hands into his outside pockets, and found a chicken in each; they appeared recently killed, and were quite warm; their necks were twisted. We took him to the King's Arms, Hampton-bottom, and found four chickens in each coat pocket, including the two found before, and in his hat were two more. We found nine in the bundle, and a speckled hen. We asked how he came by them; he said he should refer that to a future day. On the Monday week we learnt that Mr. Robins had lost poultry; the servant claimed the hen, and described the chickens accurately.Cross-examined. Q. How did they eat - Q. Pretty well, the Magistrate said we had better get rid of them; he thought the hen and two chickens sufficient to keep. He told the Magistrate he should be able to produce the person of whom he bought them. CHARLES READ . I was with Limbrick; the prisoner said he did not know what was in the bundle; they had not been killed above three hours.Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of collecting herbs for chemists; I went to Hertfordshire; two women were coming from Watford market, and as we came along, one said she had a large family, and if I bought the fowls of her, I could sell them at Uxbridge market on Thursday.

I brought him the duplicates; he said I might do as I liked with them - they were of no use to him; and I sold them to Davis. I saw him burn the duplicate of a white gown. This was Monday the 29th; he left on Tuesday afternoon, with the box and bundle tied on his shoulder, and came again in the evening; but my husband would not let him in. MOSES DAVIS . I live in Gray's Inn-lane. On Tuesday West sold me three duplicates for 5 s. 6 d. - they were for part of a veil, a gown, two petticoats, and a towel. I redeemed them, and gave them up to the officer. ROBERT KENDREW . I am servant to Mr. Nicholls, pawnbroker, Gray's Inn-lane, at the corner of Tash-street.

On the 15th of August, I apprehended the prisoner, and asked where the ladies' box was - he said he got tipsy with some womenin Drury-lane, and went from there to the White Conduit-fields, and while he was there asleep, somebody came and stole the box from him. I told him he had been to Pitway's, he said he had, and to a house in Tash-street. Davis delivered me a gown, a petticoat, a pair of shoes, and a towel.(Property produced and sworn to.)Prisoner's Defence. I was obliged to stop for a moment, and lost sight of the ladies. I met three women, one of whom I knew; I told them of it, and they said I had better take the things back to where I brought them from. We went to have something to drink - one woman went out. I missed the bundle, and went to look for her; I enquired at several places for her, and was asked to drink, got intoxicated, fell down, and burst the box open. I went to West's, and pawned the things to buy liquor for her. I went out at night, and in the morning I found myself in the fields, stripped of every thing. GUILTY . Aged 44.

There is no area gate; they must have got down by the cistern - some of the flowers were knocked off the window. I found the pannel cut out of the kitchen door, which I had barred and bolted. There was a hole large enough to let a person through - they had taken a door, which goes from the kitchen to the stairs, (and was plated with iron, and fastened with three bolts) off its hinges, and laid it down. They then had free access to the parlour. The articles stated in the indictment were stolen. I lost a half-crown, two shillings, and twelve pence from the kitchen drawer.

Pace went over the way; I remained at the door and asked if he lived in the parlour; he said,""I do occasionally, or a girl I cohabit with; I have got the key."" He opened the door, I went in with him; I found no bundles there, but on looking under the pillow, I found two shirts, one linen and the other calico; I turned them over slightly, and said,""Whose are these, I suppose they are some of your wife's chemise,?"" he made no answer; but on looking round further, he asked for my search warrant; I said he should be satisfied about that; and as Pace was coming in at the door, I asked him again about the shirts - he said they were two of his own old shirts,and he believed I should find them nearly worn out.

Early in the afternoon of the 26th of August, these pistols were pawned, and to the best of my recollection Hedges is the person; he said he gave 30 s. for them.

Stating it to be fixed to a building. JACOB METCALFE . I am the son of Mary Metcalfe , who has a house at Grove-end, Marylebone. I went there on the 30th of July, and missed a copper which I had seen there a few days before, fixed to the building. I saw it the same night in Bell-street, Marylebone, in possession of Lowther. I had employed the prisoner, about the middle of June, to do up the garden of that house - he had access to the house.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long did he work for you - A. Until the 12th - for four days. I know the copper by marks on it - nobody was in the house. My mother lives at Pentonville. MARY BURDETT . I am a broker. The prisoner brought a copper to my shop to sell, and asked 20 s. for it - we did not agree, and he took it to Lowther's, a few doors off. I think it was on the 31st of July.Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before - A. Never. He talked some time to me, which made me notice him. I know him to be the man, or I would not say so. He said he had no use for the copper, and wished to sell it. JOHN LOWTHER . I am a broker, and live in Bell-street. I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge. I have seen a person, since this transaction, so much like him, that I will not exactly swear positively that he is the man. A person came to me in a direction from Burdett's with a copper, which I bought of him - he said he was a little embarrassed in business, and had sold all his things to a broker, and the copper was the last thing he had to sell. I gave him a stove, worth 8 s., and 8 s. in money for it.Cross-examined. Q. You have seen a person so like him, that a person never seeing him before might be mistaken - A. He really is; for I ran after him myself, and pointed him out to Mrs. Burdett, and she ran also, but said she thought him a shorter man, and not like him. I did not feel comfortable after the prisoner was committed, I thought the other man so like him. The man I bought it of was ten minutes with me - it was about ten o'clock in the morning; I had a full opportunity of seeing him. WILLIAM WOODBERRY . On the 31st of July, early in the morning, I went with Metcalfe to Lowther's, and foundthe copper; and from the description he gave the Magistrate, I apprehended the prisoner - and from a name given me a man who had worked in the prosecutor's garden. He said he knew nothing of it. I said he could go with me, and if the people did not know him, I would let him go. He objected. I said if he did not, I must take him by force. Burdett and Lowther said he was the man.Cross-examined. Q. You got a description of a person who worked in Metcalfe's garden - A. Yes. Metcalfe said a person answering the description Lowther gave, had worked in his garden. I found him coming out from work at seven o'clock, and said I wanted him to go to Bell-street, he said he would not go unless I shewed him my warrant. I said I would handcuff him, and then he went peaceably. Lowther always said he was the man; I do not think he ever made any doubt of him. I will not swear that he did not - I never heard him doubt about it. JACOB METCALFE . Lowther was out when I first went there. I saw him next morning, and he equivocated - he went out of the way, and threw every obstacle in the way of our apprehending the man; but when he described him, I immediately said, that from the description he and Burdett gave, I had the fullest conviction that it was the prisoner. I have not fitted the copper to the place - it was wrenched out with a bracket. I have not seen it compared, but there is white plaster on it corresponding with where it was taken from; the workmen had put whitewash in it, and I threw some out; where the lime has been, it is marked - I had observed this.Cross-examined. Q. Have you never seen a copper with lime in it before - A. I do not know that I ever did; it is not second hand. JOHN LOWTHER . I believe it to be the copper which was sold me; Metcalf and the officers took it from me next morning. I had hammered it out.Cross-examined. Q. Metcalf did not see it till you hammered it out - A. No; my wife wiped the inside out, which might take some of the marks out.COURT. Q. Tell as how it was when you bought it - A. There was a mark where mortar had been; it was turned up in different directions, as if it had been taken out by violence. JACOB METCALF . Lowther shewed me where he had flattened it out; a bracket had been left in the kitchen, which had been worked round it to raise the brick work; there were marks where the bricks had been raised against the rim; there are marks of mortar on the bracket, and marks of the bracket on the wall.MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not see it in the state it was brought to Lowther - A. No; I know it from its general appearance; I bought it myself, the weight is sixteen pounds and a half.

I heard a noise below inside the house, about one o'clock, but thinking the servants had got up to wash, it did not alarm me. Between four and five o'clock the watchman alarmed us, and said the back garden gate had been forced. I found it so - the thieves had then got down the area, and cut a pannel out of the kitchen door, at the side of the house, and entered. The wine cellar door was forced, and a bottle of brandy, and half of another bottle drank, and some cold duck and lamb eaten. There must have been more than one man. There is a door on the kitchen stairs, which kept them from the upper part of the house. The pannel of that door was partly cut out. I missed the property stated in the indictment, which has never been found. I saw the prisoner in custody in about a fortnight. ANN HURLEY . I am servant to Mr. Hayman.

I also missed three breakfast and a dinner cloth from the kitchen, three table napkins, and a basket containing blue china. The cellar door was forced open, which was locked overnight. The shutter of the kitchen door was completely shattered, and the fastenings undone. The stair-case door was cut, but not cut out.

The other man came up to me and asked who I was looking at? I said, Not at him; he was a young man - he went back to the prisoner. They stood wrangling about a flower which the prisoner had in his mouth. I am quite certain of him. I passed them again - they said nothing then. I told a person who had been a constable of my suspicions; he went to the prisoner, who then put the basket on the top of the rails. I do not know what passed between them; but after that, the prisoner and his companion followed me, and threatened how they would illuse me, and asked if I thought they were thieves.

GEORGE STRACHAN . On the 1st of September, in the morning, I was at a public-house in Piccadilly; the prisoner sat there with a woman on his left. I went up to the counter, took out my watch, and returned it to my pocket again; he immediately rose up, and snatched it from my pocket; I laid hold of him; a scuffle ensued between us; and several people came round us; he threw it over the settle, and then broke from me. I followed close behind him - the people knocked my hat off, and he got into the street, and ran across the Haymarket into Coventry-street, a man stopped him; and I secured him without losing sight of him.Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Were you sober - A. I had drank two pints of beer, and might have had one glass of gin, but no more; I was collected, and had been with no women at the house, nor did I treat two women to my knowledge; I did not see the landlord; a woman sat next to the prisoner, and he was next to me; I did not tell the Magistrate that he handed the watch to another man; I heard Bellamy, who is not here, say that he threw his arm up.Prisoner's Defence. I went into this house with a girl of the town, and drank some beer. This gentleman stood up by the bar, and several women were round him; there was not room for me to get up. I said I should go home. The woman wanted more gin; I rose up to get her a glass, and the gentleman charged me with the theft, which I am innocent of. THOMAS DAVIDSON . I keep this public-house. I remember the prisoner coming, and saw the prosecutorcome in. I was there all the time; the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing his watch. I was very near, and saw nothing to make me think he could have done it. I was thunderstruck to think how he could take it. I saw no struggle between them; it might pass without my seeing it, while I was giving change and taking money; but if there had been a struggle, I must have seen it - if the watch was taken, it must have been done in an instant. Strachan was in company with two women of the town, who pretended to say they saw the prisoner take the watch; but after the prisoner went out, I shut the door, and would not let them in, but they afterwards returned. Strachan was half and half, and the women were drinking with him.Q. Did the prisoner run away - A. A person said he saw the prisoner take the watch, and went for a constable; and while he was gone, the prisoner certainly did make a rush and go out, but he had been in the house five or ten minutes before that - he was taken and brought to my door - I would not admit them.COURT. Q. Who brought him to your door - A. The prosecutor. I saw no attempt to collar him. When the man said he saw him take it, he gave the man a thrust aside, and went out.

I went after them, and one of them, who is not here, threw all the water over me, and hammered the tub about my head; I found the form and chair at my door broken to pieces next morning; the tubs and oysters have not been recovered.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There is a gang of boys always annoying you - A. Yes; they came up in a gang. I never saw the prisoners in the gang before; I never said that I could not say that Goodridge took the chair and form, for I saw him do it. I know no such person as Boyce, and have not spoken to him on the subject; I always said I could swear to them, and never said they did not intend to steal them. I saw Goodridge at the time the oysters were taken; the stool might be taken a quarter of an hour after. MARY HOWARD . I was at Wierman's shop, and saw Redford come up and take a tub of oysters, and saw Goodridge take the form and chair - there was a gang of them.

Did she accuse him of taking the oysters - A. No; the form and chair. BARNARD GLEED . I apprehended Redford on the 3d of September.REDFORD'S Defence. I can prove I was not there that night.GOODRIDGE'S Defence. I was passing by her house - there was a piece of work, and about ten people round her chair - they threw it at us, and we directly threw it at them. THOMAS BOYCE , JUN. I went to the prosecutrix, and spoke to her about Goodridge. She said when she came into the office, that that boy had been with others taking oysters - but she never saw him before - that he took the stool but not the oysters, and she could swear he ran away with the stool; but never saw him till he came up after the oysters were taken, which was half an hour before.COURT. Q. You said at first that she said he was with those who took the oysters - A. She called him one of their companions. She said some of the oysters were taken an hour and a half before; but I think she said some were taken not long before, and that she first saw Goodridge about half-past eight o'clock. She said she only saw him when he ran away with the stool, and that the oysters weretaken just before, and he was not one of those who took the oysters, not that he was not there when they were taken.Q. What led you to ask these questions of her - A. I live next door to the boy's master, and he asked me to go to see how the case stood with his apprentice, and when the prosecutrix came in, I asked her what the lad had been doing. ELIZA WIERMAN . On my solemn oath I never saw that man before.- PROCTOR. I was at the office with Boyce; the prosecutrix was talking to him in my presence; he went there at my request, as the boy is my apprentice; he left work at half past eight o'clock that night. She was talking to Boyce, but particularly addressed herself to me. I requested to know if she ever saw my boy before - she said she never saw him among them till that night - that he did not take the oysters, but she knew the boy who did - but that my boy took the stool and chair, and that the oysters were taken at eight o'clock, and the stool a little before ten.COURT. Q. Did she say any oysters were taken about the time the form was taken - A. She never did to me. JOHN POPKINS . I was in company with Goodridge on the night in question; we were going to my master's at Bethnal-green; as we went along there was a piece of work; we stopped to see it; a young lad took a chair, and put it towards us. Goodridge took and threw it in the road. The watchman came up; they all ran, and he ran too; he had taken no oysters, nor knocked them about; they were knocked about before he left work.COURT. Q. How do you know they were knocked about before he left work - A. I understand it was done at eight o'clock; he did not run away with the chair.- BUCKBOURN. Redford called on me at eight o'clock, and went with me to Shoreditch - and did not leave me till a quarter to ten o'clock, and was then half a mile from the prosecutrix's house; I am as confident of it, as that I stand here; and when he left me, he said he was going home to supper. I left him in Bethnal-green Road. BARNARD GLEED . I took Redford on the 3d of August, not on the night in question; he was crossing the road, and the prosecutrix said he was one of the persons who stole the oysters; he said it was another person, whom he mentioned; he admitted that he was there, but not that he stole them.

ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution.THE REVEREND WILLIAM BROWN . I am a dissenting minister, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green. On Sunday evening, the 14th of July, I had been to Prince's-street, Leicester-square, and on returning in Church-street, Bethnal-green, by Nicholas Row, I saw the prisoner and another man, by a strong gas light, standing together; I just turned round, and on turning again, the prisoner rushed against me, and took out my watch. I saw him pass it to another man rather taller than himself. I attempted to rush on him, but a man lifted up his arm and threatened to knock me down. I ran to the left to avoid the blow - they ran up Nicholas-row, and Nicholas-street, and there I lost sight of them. I went as far as the Gibraltar, public house. Gibbs the officer and several persons came up; Gibbs and I went down Church-street, to the end of Nicholas-row again. I described the persons to him, and went with him and Goddard to the prisoner's father's house, at the corner of Nicholas-row; they knocked at the door, which was opened, and the prisoner stood there with his mother. Goddard said,""Joe, step out;"" he did so, and Goddard said,""Do you know this young man?"" I said,""He has seen me before to-night, within a quarter of an hour; that is the young man who robbed me."" I verily believe him to be the man who pulled the watch from me; I am fully persuaded of it.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you not at first say he was like the man - A. Not to my recollection: I did not tell him he had seen me before, for the purpose of getting an answer from him; I did not expect any answer. The impression on my mind is fully that he is the man.Q. Have you ever seen one Greenwood - A. Yes, at Worship-street; he is something like the prisoner; it may be possible to mistake one for another with their hats on.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If you had seen Greenwood without seeing the prisoner, should you have charged Greenwood with the robbery - A. I think not; I think there is sufficient difference between the two to enable me to know him; it happened within a yard and a half of a gas lamp.COURT. Q. Would the description you gave answer to Greenwood as well as the prisoner - A. I think not: the dress was different - he had a blue coat, yellow buttons, and a black silk waistcoat - it was scarcely dark. I think Greenwod is nearly of the same height, and both have red hair.MRS. BROWN. I was with my husband, following him, and saw the prisoner run up to him. I did not see his person, only his dress - it was a blue coat and yellow buttons.Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Greenwood - A. Yes: his hair is rather red, but lighter than the prisoners. I did not see the prisoner's hair at all for he had his hat on. He was brought to our house as soon as he was taken, and placed in a room with five or six others; a man said,""Which of these is the man who robbed Mr. Brown?"" I immediately said,""That is like the man?"" CATHERINE BROWN . I was walking with my mother, and saw the dress of the person, which was a blue coat and yellow buttons; he was brought to our house afterwards, and I pointed him out as the one most like the man.Q. Did you see Greenwood - A. Yes, next day, before the Magistrate; and he had a blue coat and yellow buttons.Greenwood being in custody, was produced in Court. WILLIAM GIBBS . I am an officer. Mr. Brown complained to me, and described the person; he said he had a blue coat, yellow buttons, a black waistcoat, and I think a black handkerchief. I went with him to the prisoner's house; his mother, he, and his brother came out; he came to the threshold of the door; I crossed over the road to Mr. Brown, and asked if he had any doubt of the man, and he said, No; I held the candle up to Mr. Brown to see him, and he said,""I have no doubt at all of that man."" I afterwards took him to Mr. Brown's house; there were several in the room; Mrs. and Miss Brown pointed him out.COURT. Q. What did the prisoner say - A. He asked what I wanted; I did not satisfy him; he said he was innocent, but that he had been at the Shoulder of Mutton and Cat, public-house, which is about twenty minutes walk from where the robbery was committed.Cross-examined. Q. How near is the Porto-Bello, public-house, from where the robbery was done - A. If you go round, it is about seventy-three yards. JAMES GODDARD . I went with Gibbs, his account is correct.Prisoner's Defence. I have witnesses to prove my innocence. MARY ALLEN . I am servant at the Porto Bello, public-house. On the night Mr. Brown was robbed, I was at the door with the prisoner and Ann Ellam ; he had been with us twenty minutes, when we heard the cry of, Stop thief! he did not leave then, but stood with me till half-past ten o'clock.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How far is this house from where Mr. Brown was robbed - A. Eighty or ninety yards; it has been measured; he had been at the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton; I heard the alarm twenty minutes before ten o'clock; he never moved from the door till half-past ten o'clock.Q. What might you be talking about - A. About going with us on the following Sunday to Eel ferry on pleasure; he had nothing at our house; I serve the customers, but we are a little at leisure on Sunday nights. I do not know where the ferry is; it was not settled how we were to go; we talked about nothing else, except that he had been to the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton. John Hatch came up after the alarm, and stopped about half an hour with us; and went away with the prisoner; he lives next door; he talked to the prisoner about the thieves going by.Q. What, did the thieves go by - A. Yes; I saw them both go by; they were both taller than the prisoner; the prisoner had a blue coat, light pantaloons, a black waistcoat, and a while handkerchief, I believe. JOHN HATCH . I am a weaver, and live next door to the Porto Bello. I had just come in, and was in my lower room, when I heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran out to the Porto Bello, and saw Redman, Allen, and Ellem, John Reckford , and Joseph Debas , all talking together; I knew the prisoner before; he had a blue coat, but being dark, I did not notice his dress. I asked what was the matter, and was told some gentleman had lost his watch. I staid there about twenty minutes, and said it was a pity they were not stopped.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went out of your parlour and found all these five persons talking together - A. Yes; I think it was the prisoner who said a gentleman had lost his watch; the gentleman called Stop thief! and when he came to the corner of the Porto Bello, he said""I have lost my watch;"" I heard him say so.Q. Then why ask what was the matter - A. Why, it is natural to ask the question; I staid there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; I heard nothing about going to the ferry. When I went away I left them standing there, I am sure of it; I stood at my door and saw them talking together for some time after I left. Beckford and Debas told me they had come up on hearing the cry of Stop thief!MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had the cry of Stop thief! got a good many people together - A. It had; it was at a distance from where the robbery was done. ANN ELLAM . I work for a weaver. Redman was keeping me company; in July I was standing at the door of the Porto Bello with him talking to Allen; we heard the alarm five or ten minutes after ten o'clock. I had been in his company from seven o'clock that night, and never left him. We were at the door when the cry was raised; Hatch came up directly after the thieves ran by; we had been talking about going to Eel ferry. Hatch came up and said,""Why did not you stop them?"" The prisoner said,""I did not know it was thieves; I thought it was only fun."" The prisoner was with us half an hour after that. Hatch went away to Woodcock the patrol. The prisoner was dressed in a blue coat and yellow buttons, black waistcoat, and pepper and salt trowsers, and a black handkerchief.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where had you and him been - A. To the Cat and Mutton. We went there about twenty minutes past seven o'clock, and remained there till twenty minutes after nine o'clock exactly - it is about half a mile from the Porto Bello. I was talking with Allen and the prisoner at the time of the alarm - nobody else was with us. Beckford and Debas stood at the corner as the thieves ran by - they then came up. Only we three were to go to Eel ferry - the gentleman stopped at the corner, and said to the men who stood there,""I have lost my watch."" This was just before Hatch came up. I went away with the prisoner, about a quarter of an hour after Hatch went; we left at half past ten. The prisoner went to his mother's which is about sixty yards off. I stood at the door when Gibbs the officer came up. I did not know him; he asked who I was waiting for. I said,""Not for you."" He said,""Cannot you give an answer?"" I said I was waiting for a young man who was just gone in to see how his mother's leg was.COURT. Q. Did you hear any charge made against him about a watch - A. Yes, and told Gibbs. I had been in his company all night, at the Cat and Mutton and Porto Bello. Gibbs told me to stay there, for he wanted to take him for a few minutes, and he sent to me after, to say he was gone to Mr. Brown's. I went there, and saw the officersbring him out; he said he was going to the watch-house, as he was accused of Mr. Brown's robbery. I said several times in the hearing of the officers, that he had been with me, and it was impossible.MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you go to the Magistrate, to give the account you gave to-day - A. Yes; they said no witnesses for prisoners were wanted there. WILLIAM GIBBS . I saw this woman there, but never heard a word about her being in his company. I might have told her to stay there till I returned. I remember her saying they had been to the Cat and Mutton that night together, and Redman mentioned about being at the Porto Bello. She said at the watch-house, that she had been with him, but I do not think she mentioned it before. JAMES GODDARD . I heard her say she had been at Porto Bello, but not at the Cat and Mutton, and that he could not have committed the robbery, for he had been in her company.

WILLIAM CURTIS . I am a seafaring man, and lodged at No. 34, Great Hermitage-street. On Tuesday night, the 18th of September, about twelve o'clock, I was coming from New Lambeth cut, towards my lodging. I had been drinking a little. I had just got across Tower-hill, when a man thrusts his hand athwart my breast; my pocket-book was in my breast pocket - it contained two one-pound Bank notes, some letters and papers. I had five sovereigns in my pantaloons pocket, with fifteen or sixteen shillings in silver; I called Stop thief! I only saw one person; I was knocked down, I do not know who by. I became senseless by the blow, and cannot say whether my pocket-book was taken or not before I was knocked down, but my pockets had not been rifled of my money. When I recovered my senses, I found myself in the hands of the watchmen, and that my money was all gone - it had been loose in my pocket. I had no opportunity of observing the person of the man - the blow was very severe, and I was bruised about the loins, which, I think, must have been from a kick after I was knocked down. I found the prisoner was secured. I saw my pocket-book next morning at the watch-house, with the two Bank-notes and papers in it. I have never heard of the money. When Pincombe came up, I was on the spot where I was knocked down. JOHN PINCOMBE . I am a watchman of White's-yard. About one o'clock in the morning, I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner running down from the end of White's-yard, in a direction from where the cry came; he was alone - there was nobody before him, or near him, when I first caught sight of him. I tried to stop him, but he ran so fast, and with such force, that he broke from my hold. I pursued him. (The spot where I saw him runing was about fifty yards from where I found Curtis.) He was stopped without my losing sight of him, within three or four yards of me. I found Curtis between the corner of White's-yard, and the City of Carlisle, public-house. After taking the prisoner to the watch-house, I came down again on my beat, and found the pocket-book about three o'clock, opposite the Compasses, public-house, within about four yards of where he was stopped; nobody was passing near that spot when the prisoner was running. I gave it to Plunkett, the beadle; and found two notes in it, and papers. I shut it up without examining it. JOHN JONES . I work for Mr. Coultney, a wheelwright, in Church-lane, Whitechapel. I had been out with a friend on this night, and coming down the street, I saw Pincombe, and soon after I heard the cry. I was standing right opposite the Compasses, in White's-yard, at the time - I turned round, and the prisoner fell into my arms. Pincombe, who was following, came up and secured him. Nobody but the prisoner was near; I saw Curtis three or four minutes after; he was about sixty or seventy yards from where the prisoner was stopped, and appeared hurt a great deal, and said he had been robbed; he had a bruise on the head - it did not bleed. I did not see the pocket book found. GEORGE DAVIS . I am a watchman of Whitechapel. One part of my beat is close to White's-yard; I heard the cry when I was about forty yards from White's-yard. I stopped a young man named Powis coming round the corner of Dock-street. I cannot say where he came from; the Grand Jury threw out the bill against him. I saw the prisoner in custody of Pincombe. RICHARD PLUNKETT . I am the watch-house keeper. Greenwood was brought into my custody; he said he knew nothing of it. Pincombe delivered me the pocketbook about three o'clock; it contained letters directed to Cornwall, and other papers, and two one-pound Bank notes; the prosecutor claimed it, and the contents. I searched both the men who were taken, but found nothing particular upon them.Prisoner. Q. Was not the prosecutor very much in liquor - A. He appeared worse for liquor; he came in leaning down - but he said he had been kicked in the side; and there was a mark of violence on his eye. He said he had missed his way crossing the hill.

The pocket-book is mine; here are letters which are written by a friend of mine, and which I intended to put into the post; and there is a name on one of the notes, which I know it by. I have had the book twenty years.Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all about it. I was going home; it is a long way from White's-yard to Tower-hill. I should think there were watchmen enough to stop me before I got there. RICHARD PLUNKETT . I think it is better than half a mile from Tower-hill; but the robbery was done near the corner of White's-yard. GUILTY - DEATH .

I am a copper-plate printer, and live in Portpool-lane. I work for Mr. Elvey, of Castle-street. On the 21st of July, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was in Leather-lane - I was quite sober. I stopped at the corner of a gateway for a necessary purpose. I had a sovereign, two half-crowns, two shillings, and some halfpence in my pocket. A man thrust his hand into my pocket - I did not see him come up to me. I turned round very quick, and entangled his hand between my arm and my pocket - I seized his hand, and charged him with taking my money. He said,""Here, here, you fool, don't make any noise, and take what belongs to you,"" returning me 1 s. 4 d.; he immediately ran off, and I cried Stop thief! he was stopped in my sight - and at the watch-house he was asked what money he had about him; he said when he left home he had 5 s., but he had spent some of it. He was asked if he had a sovereign; he said if he had he would forfeit his existence. A sovereign, two half-crowns, a few shillings, and about eighteen-pence in copper were found on him. The amount was more than I had lost. He is the man - I never saw him before.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. It was all done in a moment - A. Yes; but he was not out of my sight. BENJAMIN KERNEY . I am a patrol. I was in Leather-lane, thirty or forty yards from the gateway, and heard the cry - I saw the prisoner running, and stopped him; the prosecutor immediately came up, and charged him with robbing him of a sovereign - the prosecutor appeared sober. When we got to the watch-house, I asked him what money he had; he said 5 s. or not so much - he appeared sober. He said if I found a sovereign on him, he would forfeit his existence. I found a sovereign, two half-crowns, two shillings and sixpence, and eighteen pence halfpenny on him. CORNELIUS NORRIS . I am a broker, and live in Leather-lane. I was about forty yards off, and heard the cry, and saw the prisoner running from the gateway.

I said at the watch-house that I had a sovereign, and a little silver. Another man was brought in and let go. On the Monday following the prosecutor came into the public-house by the office - he did not know me them. Kerney took him aside; he then said I was the man.JEREMLAM RIPPINGTON.

THOMAS ROBINSON . I am a cooper, and live in Brittania-terrace, City-road. On the 7th of August, about nine o'clock at night, I was at the end of Castle-street, City-road, going home, and heard a voice behind say,""Now, draw it,"" and instantly the prisoners sprang from the corner of the street, caught hold of my watch chain, and pulled it with great violence. My watch was fastened by a chain round my neck - the watch ring broke, and he got the the chain, two seals, and a key; he ran down Castle-street, and I after him. I saw nobody near him - he was stopped before I lost sight of him, about a hundred and fifty yards off. I saw Harris at Worship-street next morning. My chain was picked up immediately after about a yard and a half from Strange. JOHN GREEN . I am a tailor, and live in Margaret-street, Hackney-fields. I was in Tubernacle-walk, and just before I got to Castle-street, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran to the corner, and saw the prisoner Strange running as hard as he could. I stopped him - he threw the chain and seals into the gutter. Robinson came up immediately. SAMUEL BRIDGES . I am a constable. I was standing at the corner of Chiswell-street, Finsbury-square, and met the two prisoners about nine o'clock, in company with three more; they went into the square, and stopped near the rails, and were in conversation together. I watched them at the corner of the City-road, up and down the pavement to and fro; they looked at several people who were passing, and presently Robinson came by; there was a strong gas light; several of them looked at him, and noticed his seals. I kept behind them, going towards Castle-street, and then Strange stepped a little forward, the rest being behind; Harris was only a few yards behind him; Strange got under the gas light at the corner of Castle-street. Mr. Robinson came up, the word Click was given by one of them. Strange instantly snatched at the chain, and went down Castle-street; I followed, and so did his companions for a few yards; there was a cry about twenty yards down the street of,""D - n his eyes, knock him down;"" I drew my staff out, and one of them was going to hit Mr. Robinson on the neck behind, but I knocked the person down; I do not know who he was.

He was taken directly after in Providence-row; I saw him in custody an hour and a half after I took Strange to the watch-house.Prisoner HARRIS. Q. Did you not bring a boy to the watch-house, and hold a light to him, and ask if I wasthe man - A. A boy said one man was taken and put in Shoreditch watch-house; I went and found Harris there, and immediately said he was one - I never expressed a doubt about him. I thought at first that he might be the man I knocked down, but on looking at him I saw he was not.(Property produced and sworn to.) ROBERT INGRAM . I am a watchman of London-wall. I saw Harris in the evening in question in Providence-row, two streets from Castle-street, moving along with another person. Somebody was crying Stop thief! I pursued, and he ran another way.

I gave him into Walton's charge, at the watch-house, not knowing what he had done. JOSEPH WALTON . I am an officer. I was at the watch-house. Harris was brought in by Ingram, who said a robbery had been committed in the City-road, and believed him to be one of the party. I afterwards saw Bridges at the watch-house door, and said he was one of the party. I said,""Have you got the swag?"" he shewed me the chain and seals; he spoke positively to him.Prisoner STRANGE. I committed the robbery, but Harris is innocent.HARRIS'S Defence. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and ran with the rest of the party; a man caught me in his arms; several gentlemen came up and said I was not the man.

I awoke him, and said, I wanted him for robbing the prosecutor of eight sovereigns and 16 s. and a hat; he denied it; I asked for his hat, he made no answer; but the landlady said in the presence of the prisoner and his mother,""Here is his hat; his mother left it in the bar as he was tipsy;"" the prosecutor claimed it. I took him to the watch-house; he said he had no money at all. I found 16 s. in silver in his neckcloth, and he said the hat claimed by the prosecutor was his; I told him the prosecutorhad his hat on; he then said it must be a mistake, the hats are quite different; one is straw, and the other is beaver.Cross-examined.

THOMAS BARROW . I live at Lee, in Kent. I keep my cart opposite my door, and job about with it. I saw it safe on the 4th of September, at nine o'clock at night. I always leave it there; there was no horse in it. I missed it in the morning, and on the Sunday following, I saw it in Whitechapel, in possession of the officer. I have seen the prisoner Wise travelling about, but I cannot say where.Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. You kept it in the public road - A. Yes. There are a great many people about there. WILLIAM FORSTER . I am a constable. On the 5th of September, I saw Houseman painting this cart, at the Flying-horse, Spitalfields, between twelve and one o'clock. I asked whose it was; he said it belonged to a man at Islington. At first he said the name was Webb - then that he was mistaken, that it was Scott. I asked where Scott lived - he said in John-street, Islington; that he, Scott, came to his house, and employed him to paint it that morning. Wise was in conversation with him when I went up, and he said to him,""You had better go and fetch Scott."" Wise said.""I will soon go and fetch the man who owns the cart."" Wise went away, and did not return. I then told Houseman, I had every reason to believe the cart was stolen, and that he must go to the office with me, which he did. There were nail-marks where the tin containing the name had been removed from - one nail was taken out, and the rest remained on. Near the whole of the side where it had been was painted over, but not the other side. As we were going to the office, he said,""What a fool I am!"" I said,""What for?"" he answered,""The man whom you have let go is the man who employed me to paint the cart."" I advertised the cart - Barrow claimed it. Houseman said he lived in New Harper-street, Haggerstown. I went and found Wise there - we knocked twice. Fortune was with me, and when we got to the house, I sent him up stairs, and Wise came from the backyard. I told him I wanted him; he asked what for. I asked where the man was whom the cart belonged to, and whom he was to fetch; he said he had been to John-street, but that the man he saw there had not sent a cart to be painted. I said Houseman said he had employed him; he said it was not true. I took him in charge; he then said he had shewn Houseman where to go to paint it.Cross-examined. Q. The Flying-horse is a public-house - A. Yes; it was in Flyinghorse-yard; there are wheelers, stone-masons, and stables there, but their things do not stand in the open yard. He said Wise had better go and fetch Scott; this was about half past twelve o'clock in the day. The cart was red, and they were painting it lead colour. I went to every John-street in Islington, and could find no such person as Scott.COURT. Q. Did Wise ever say in what part of Islington he saw Scott - A. He said he had been to John-street - it is impossible that he could have gone to Islington, for we took him in an hour, and he must have gone six miles in that time. I found a sack with chaff in it in the house. MOSES FORTUNE . I went with Forster to Haggerstown, and found Wise there - he came from the back of the house. I was up stairs, and Forster called me down. We handcuffed him. We could find no Scott at Islington.Cross-examined. Q. You went in consequence of information from Forster - A. I was sent for, and found Houseman with a paint brush in his hand, and went to Haggerston to look for Wise. I was up stairs when he came from the back yard - I was not up stairs two minutes. There was a woman at the door, who threatened me to mind what I was doing. I had been searching the rooms. I saw a quantity of wearing apparel in a chest, which was open, and thinking it could not belong to such persons, I thought proper to take it. I swear that I took no money.Q. Now, did not the woman say you had no business to take the man's clothes or money - A. She said I had no right to take the clothes. I said, under the circumstances I had, and would account about them before the Magistrate, and I returned them before the Magistrate.Q. Did not Eliza Elstead say you had no right to take the man's money - A. No; I threatened to take her into custody for obstructing me in my duty. I asked Wise if the clothes belonged to him; he said a jacket did, and pressed me very much to give it him; I refused, thinking it might lead to something. I delivered up every thing to Houseman's wife before the Magistrate on the day they were re-examined; I have seen the prosecutor twice; I have not managed the prosecution; I never offered to let him go for 5 l.; I had no conversation with the woman, except to tell her not to obstruct me. THOMAS BARROW re-examined. When I found the cart, it was painted in a different colour; my name was on a tin plate nailed on when it was stolen. I missed it at half-past five o'clock when I got up.HOUSEMANS' Defence. I told him as plain as I could speak that it belonged to Scott of Islington; he forgot the name and asked me. I told him twice, and at the office he made a mistake, and told the Magistrate the name was Webb; I was going to correct him, but he would not let me speak.WISE'S Defence. I know nothing about it. A man came and said, if I was going that way to work he had a cart to send; he asked me the way to the street, and I shewed him. ELIZA ELSTEAD . I live at New Haggerston; the prisoners live at No. 4., and 1 at No. 7.; Houseman is married,and works in a brick-field; I have known him about eight months; my husband is a tanner.Q. Do you remember any officers coming to Houseman's house - A. Two gentlemen came and asked for William Hayes ; they had it on a bit of paper; they were officers - they knocked at Houseman's door; I said to them,""The poor woman has just left the house with a child in her arms.""Q. Well, did any body come to the door - A. No; a little boy not four years of age was in there; he was not capable of opening the door; they flung up the window, and one gentleman got in. I went to look after my children; I came out and saw the door open - they were both in the house; they could not have been in the house above a minute - one gentleman went up stairs, I followed him up, and said,""Gentlemen, you are in the wrong house,"" as they had asked for Hayes, who had moved; I said,""Begging your pardon, they have been here some months;"" the gentleman who stood at the door called to the other,""Come down, you are wrong;"" he said so twice running - I went up into the room, and saw he had thrown up the poor woman's bed; he was turning from the bed as I went up stairs; he then went to her chest, which was a long one, and the first thing he took out was some linen, which appeared to be sheets - and he took out the man's coat, and the child's clothes, and every thing the poor woman had; he emptied the chest, except the man's hat and two pieces of paper - he tied them in his handkerchief, came down, and took some more things off the table; he took a leno cap with two pieces of lace on it, and put that in his waistcoat pocket. I said,""What a pity Sir, to distress a poor woman when she is not at home, and have you any authority;"" he said,""What is that to you, if you ayn't off out of the house, I will take you with me;"" I said, I was willing to go any where with any gentleman, who would use me well. I was not saucy to him, though he says I was. They were in the house about a quarter of an hour - they made me go out before them a few minutes; I stood at my own door, and saw them tie a new gown piece of the woman's up - Fortune is the gentleman. I find no fault with the other. While I was in the house, the young man came in out of the yard; the gentleman was coming down stairs with the things just at that time; there are only three rooms - he had had plenty of time to search all over the house. When Wise came in, the gentleman said,""Well Mr. Dick, you are the man I am looking for,"" and immediately handcuffed him; they went away leaving the door wide open, and the things at the mercy of every body. I saw no money taken; they asked me if there was any stables about; I said,""No;"" they said,""They used to have one over the way;"" I said they had given it up some time, and that the man who had it now, had it with the lease of the house. I sent them to him at the chandler's shop; I went home and have not seen them since. Houseman is a hard working man, and bore an honest character.COURT. Q. You are intimate with the family - A. No; I did not visit them. I have been in to speak to them - I saw no money taken. I never heard that Houseman was a painter, or saw paint in the house. I only know Wise by seeing him about there; his brother used to live in that street, but has been gone some time before this happened. I have not seen the prisoners in company. I do not know what business Wise had there. I never knew him work as a painter.MR. NORTON. Q. Did you go to the Magistrate to complain of the officers' conduct - A. No. Mrs. Houseman went about her money - I did not go with her. Houseman used to drive a horse and cart for a man. JONATHAN TREVETT . I live at No. 13, John-street, Chicksand-street, Brick-lane, within a hundred yards of where the cart was found. Houseman is a total stranger to me; I never saw him till he was at the office. I saw the cart in Flying Horse-yard, about twelve o'clock in the morning, no painting was done to it then - nobody was near it. I saw a man in the yard, who said his name was Scott - he asked if I knew of any painter, who would paint him a cart; I said, No - this was at twelve o'clock, as I was going to dinner.Q. Was there any paint in the place - A. No. I was to paint it myself, only I had work; I am a carpenter. I said such a job as that any body could do. I left him. Next day I met a relation of the prisoner's, who was enquiring for Scott.COURT. Q. What colour was the cart - A. It looked like a one horse cart, and was of a reddish cast. I cannot say whether it had a name on it; I did not take notice.Q. How came this man to say his name was Scott; did you ask him where he lived - A. I asked him where he lived.Q. Will you swear you asked this strange man where he lived - A. Not where he lived. I asked his name.Q. On your oath did you ask his name - A. I did not ask his name.Q. You have just said you did - A. I asked his name, but not where he lived; I asked his name, because I would have sent him down a man if I knew of any body.Q. You would have sent him where - A. To Flying-horse-yard.Q. Who first asked you to come here - A. He is outside - I forget his name; he passed me in Flying-horse-yard, as I went to dinner one day; he was enquiring for Scott. I told him there was such a man in the neighbourhood.Q. Then you really thought that such a man lived in the neighbourhood - A. I really did - I heard nobody mention John-street, Islington. I returned through the yard again, about half-past twelve o'clock, from dinner. The cart was there then; nothing was doing to it then. I only passed on; there was nobody near it, nor any paint.HOUSEMAN - GUILTY . Aged 30. Confined One Year .WISE - GUILTY . Aged 25.

I had not noticed him in the public house. He asked me where I was going? and I said to town, and could go without his assistance.

I lifted him up, and sat him against the wall, he said he would give any body what they required to see him to Tyburn, and what happened afterwards I dont know; he had brought a man and woman into the public house, and they all drank together.

I said I had no small change, but took out a sovereign, told him to go to the bar and get change, keep 1 s. for himself, and give me the rest; but instead of going to the bar, he went out of the house. I went to follow him, and the prisoner pulled me into the bar, and shut the bar door. I turned round, and shoved it right open again. I did not call out to the people in the tap-room. As I turned to open the bar door, she put her hand into my pocket, and took out seven sovereigns which remained. I laid hold of her arm before she had quite got her arm from my person; she had got her hand out of my pocket. I seized it, and asked her to give me them back, but she said,""I sha'nt."" I asked her again; she told me to go to hell and get them. I did not call out, but went up stairs to consider what I should do. I expected she would return them next morning. I remained up stairs till next morning, without telling any one. I am a stranger here - I have not been in England for three years. There were soldiers and girls of the town in the house. I came down about eight o'clock in the morning; I saw her soon after. I came down, and asked her for my money; she said,""Go to hell, you old fool - what I have got, you gave to spend."" I said I should go and find a friend to see into it; she said,""Go to hell."" I went to a shipmate of mine; he went with me to the office, and told the Magistrate. This was on Thursday - the robbery was on Monday. My friend could not go with me before. I slept at her house on Tuesday, but at my friend's on Wednesday. I went there on Tuesday, about eleven o'clock, and asked her for it; she gave the same answer. She was taken up on Friday - she detained my box and bedding. I have come from prison now, as her husband has arrested me for a false debt, to prevent my appearing.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How much have they been wicked enough to arrest you for - A. 19 l. odd; they owe me money now; he arrested me three weeks ago; I did not tell them I was going to sea; I had received twenty-one sovereigns at the office in the Commercial-road; I paid eleven away - I never bought a watch of the prisoner. I had been in company with no loose woman that night; I was at Bates's ten days before I received the money; I kept my room all night, and brought no girls there. Every body in the room saw that I was robbed. I understand some of them said that I had left the country, and so she got bailed. I know Spruder of White Cross-street prison; I never had any conversation with him about this; I never desired him to write me a letter - I cannot read. Jones was with me when I received my money; I went with him and paid my debts. On Saturday morning, when I received my money, her husband took me to see a dance. I took out four sovereigns that day, and spent about 2 l. in clothes. JAMES JONES . I am a seaman. I was in the office on Saturday when the prosecutor received his pay, which was twenty odd sovereigns. On the Wednesday following he came to me and stated that he was robbed; and on the Friday the prisoner was taken.Cross-examined. Q. She came willingly to the office - A. A message was sent for her; the officers were after her.Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel. ELIZABETH HINCKLEY . I live in St. Catherine's, and am the wife of an excise officer. I have known the prisoner two years. On the eighth of July, till about half past four in the afternoon, I was with her at Wapping; she begged of me to go home to her house; I went and left her in Ratcliffe-highway; she said she was going to see a friend - I stopped there, and saw her come home about nine o'clock. I did not see Baker that night - I made tea for her children, and was in the bar till nine; if he had been in the house I must have seen him. The prisoner was not at home on the Monday night in question. I have been examined before one of the Judges about this, and gave this account to the Magistrate also; she went to the office of her own accord.COURT. Q. Did you go with her - A. Yes; On the Friday I heard the prosecutor give part of his account, and I said she was not at home at the time. Jones was with him. but he is her enemy, for he persuaded him to do this rash act. I had some washing of his at my house, and when he came, he said he Baker should do such a rash deed, and send her out of the country. Baker had boarded with the prisoner when he was in England before, and owed them a considerable sum of money. I have heard Bates say it was 19 l., and I heard him say,""Oh mother, I will pay you in due time."" ELEANOR HOLT . I am the wife of James Holt , who is a labourer in the East India-house. On Monday the 7th of July, the prisoner came to my house at four o'clock as I was sitting down to tea; I live in Hall's-rents, St. Catharines. I was in her company from that time till near nine o'clock; we went out together about five o'clock to the Minories shopping till near nine, then went home with her - the last witness was then in the bar; I did not sit down, but came home. I did not see Baker, but I saw him at the bar-door on Tuesday with two disorderly women; he called to Mrs. Bates, and said,""Mother, will you get some dinner for me and my two women."" Bates said,""No, Baker, you owe me quite sufficient, how can you bring such people to my house;I will get dinner for you but not for them."" He asked her for 1 s., she gave him 6 d., and he went out with them; he did not mention a syllable about being robbed. JAMES JONES . I never heard her claim money of Baker, as due to her before. I was at the house myself on Monday night, from six to eight o'clock, to know where Baker was. I sat in the bar with Mrs. Bates. ANN FLEMMING . I am servant to Bates. I remember the day Baker says he was robbed. I saw him come in. in the afternoon. Mrs. Hinckley came there between four and five o'clock; my mistress came home after candlelight, which must be after eight o'clock - she was out till then. Hinckley came to take care of the children. JOHN BAKER . Q. On your oath, did not this woman tell you you owed her money before - A. No. I lodged with her about a year and a half before. I did not pay her, but her husband went to Doctors' Commons, and drew my money without my consent; he told me next morning that he had done it, and said,""There is 2 l. for you."" My money was 14 l. odds. I was fourteen days in his house - he gave me no bill, or said what I owed him. He said I must pay for three men as well as myself.

He asked me early in April to take an account of them. I did so; there were between eight and nine hundred. On the 9th of July, he sent for me again - I counted them, and missed two hundred and sixty-three. I saw four or five of them afterwards, in possession of Coombs, and knew them; they were proof impressions. I never saw the prisoner at the house.

He said if I should see Mr. Lee at any time, not to tell him of it, as he might be jealous. I gave them to Mr. Hulm, the broker - the prisoner called ten or twelve days after, and I told him I had given them away, as framing was very expensive. He said he had bought above two hundred, and he would give me some more, and he brought a large roll to leave at my house - I asked him to pay me what he owed me; he said I might take them - I refused. He left them, and a few days after I shewed them to Mr. Pass. The prisoner came, and fetched them away three or four days after that. WILLIAM PASS . I am a carver and gilder.

I said it did not matter, provided it was safely delivered to Mr. Beaumont, the Sheriff's officer. Nicholls had thrown the cheque down, and the prisoner said hecould go in half the time that I could. The money was to discharge a bond of judgment against me. I agreed he should take the draft; we went in a coach to the Sheriff's office, in Wych-street; just before we got there, he said he wanted a draught of beer. We got out of the coach; I said he might have some, but must not sit down to drink; he said he would go and pay the money at the Sheriff's office, which was next door - and I remained in the house, thinking he was gone for that purpose, but he ran away with it.

I won't tell a lie about it;"" the Magistrate said,""Man, don't convict yourself;"" but he replied again, that he had robbed his master. Murrell said he was working in the feather-room, up two pair of stairs shortly before Christmas, and that Banner came to him and said,""I have got some plate here, and his answer was,""Bill, put it aside for the present;"" and that about a week after he found the plate at Green's house; he addressed himself to Banner and said,""Was it not so;"" Banner said,""Tell your story.""

I produce a letter which was delivered to me in the Office, by a stranger, on the prisoner's second or third examination. I sent for Clarke and asked him if it was his hand-writing; he said, No, but the signature was his. RICHARD HILL . I am an attorney, and live in Chancery-lane, and was attorney in this cause, and attended the trial. I have a notice of set off, which was produced in the cause - there is a set off, for a bill of Beckenham's; the document was left at my office by a person whom I did not see; it was acted upon on the trial of the cause - the prisoner was present on the trial, also Mr. Isaacson, his attorney. I have the Judge's order. dated the 10th of May, 1822, for the defendant to deliver to the attorney - for the plaintiff's particulars of the set off, within four days - (read.) In pursuance of this order particulars were delivered to me, and the set off brought in in the usual manner, and the writing is the hand-writing of Isaacson's clerk. (The set off was here read.) The prisoner attended the trial himself. I demanded 16 l. 4 s. 6 d., for the plaintiff, and gave evidence of that demand, and the defendant gave evidence of his demand in the set off, and produced a cheque in Court endorsed, to shew that Beckenham's bill -MR. SERGEANT PELL, (for the prisoner.) Q. Who produced it - A. You did Sir; at the time the counsel was opening his defence on the ground of that cheque - he turned round to Brookes and Isaacson, who sat behind him, and the prisoner delivered the cheque into Mr. Sergeant Pell 's hands.MR. CURWOOD. Q. Was any bill of Seager's given in evidence by the defendant - A. I rather think we produced Seager's bill - it was produced to prove that it was given in discharge of Beckenham's bill of 17 l. 9 s. in discharge of the set off. Brookes produced the cheque to shew that Seager's bill was not given in discharge of Beckenham's bill; but that he had discounted it, and the endorsement at the back of it was to shew the manner in which he had discounted the bill. At that time a cause was pending in the King's Bench, between the same parties. I have the writ, declaration, and issue here. The cause of action stated in the declaration is that it was for a bill drawn by Beckenham, on the 22d of October, 1821, accepted by Thomas Griftiths , at two months, for 17 l. 9 s. 6 d. Mr. Isaacson was attorney in this cause also. This appears to be the bill included in the set off in the Common Pleas. The cause in the Common Pleas had been tried on the 12th of January, and two days after I took out a summons before Mr. Justice Best, for the plaintiff to attend next day at two o'clock, to shew cause why the cheque proved on the trial should not he deposited with the clerk of the nisi prius for the defendant and his witnesses to inspect the same. (Summons read.) Isaacson and I attended the return of the summons. I am not certain whether Brookes was there. The cheque was not produced, and his Lordship made an order that the cheque be delivered to Mr. Isaacson, the plaintift's attorney, and that I should be at liberty to take a copy of it, and that Isaacson should produce it at chambers at twenty-four hours notice, to such persons as I wished to inspect it. Isaacson undertook to produce it on the trial of the cause. In pursuance of that order I received at myhouse a copy of the cheque, with a letter at the bottom, in the hand-writing of Turner, Isaacson's clerk - it is the same hand-writing as the proceedings in the cause. After this I took out two other summonses; one dated the 26th of June, for Isaacson to attend chambers at eleven o'clock on Friday, to shew cause why he should not produce the cheque mentioned in the order of the 15th - nobody attended that order, and I took out further summonses for Isaacson and the plaintiff to attend, for the same purpose on the 29th; this was a peremptory summons. There was no Judge till the 3d of July, when Isaacson attended before Mr. Justice Best, who heard us both, and then ordered that on Friday next the cheque should be produced to me at chambers. On the Friday following, Isaacson, Brookes, myself, my clerk, and my brother attended. I told his Lordship in their presence that I had received the copy of the cheque in pursuance of his Lordship's former order; but had not been able to see the original - that I had given the names of four persons to attend chambers, to inspect it. Brookes was in hearing all the time. The Judge turned round to Isaacson, and said,""Where is the original cheque;"" Isaacson stated that it was before counsel - the Judge immediately said,""Well, then you can fetch it in a few minutes;"" he hesitated, and then stated to the Judge, that he had delivered it back to Brookes - the Judge turned to Brookes with the copy of the cheque in his hand, and said,""Is this a copy of the cheque;"" Brookes replied""It is."" The Judge said,""Where is the original;"" he paused a moment. The Judge repeated his question - he then said he either was or felt himself in a very serious situation - that he had taken very able advice, and had been advised to destroy the cheque, and had destroyed it. The Judge said, no honourable man could have given such advice, and we left the Judge.Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT PELL. Q. You have been an attorney many years - A. Thirty years.Q. Have you ever had any words with Mr. Brookes - A. Never, till on this occasion. I never had anything to do with him till this came into my office.Q. Since that has there not been circumstances under which you thought Mr. Brookes had used words which irritated you; you thinking you did not deserve them - A. Yes. I have expressed a determination to bring him to public trial. I was examined as a witness for Clarke, against Brookes in the Common Pleas.Q. Do not you know that Brookes considered your evidence as not true - A. I do not know. I have been threatened, and stopped in the street, and had mobs raised about me. I have been intimidated in all manner of ways. On the 14th I commenced proceedings to get the cheque, and then he charged me with perjury, conspiracy, fraud, and every thing. He threatened me in the public street, to charge me with perjury.Q. You have stated that Brookes handed over the cheque to his counsel in Court - did you mean to state positively that you saw him deliver it into my hand - A. I am positive, it was handed up to the Judge, and afterwards came into the hands of Clarke's counsel - Clarke saw it; we both saw it. It was afterwards handed to somebody. I never saw the original cheque after I left the Court. No application was made to the Judge to direct it to be impounded.Q. Is not the action brought by Brookes against Clarke, on the bill of Griffiths still pending - A. It is. I should state that he told the Judge he meant to decline that action. The record has been withdrawn.Q. Do you remember immediately after the trial, which was on the 12th of June, which party served the other with a summons - A. I did. The first summons was on the 14th.Q. Look at this summons, which is ours - A. This is dated the 13th. I do not believe it was served. I believe the first summons served on me, was on the 17th, 18th, and 19th. They were in the cause in the King's Bench. I only speak from the papers, and I have but three summonses here - (looking at a paper) - this is my clerk's writing, signed in my name, and by my authority. I believe no summons was served on me before the 17th. The paper which I say is my clerk's writing is dated the 15th of June. I was attending the Judge on the subject of the summons, and this was mentioned.Q. Is not the paper dated the 15th, which came out of your office, entitled""Brookes against Clarke"" - A. Yes. It is the names of the three clerks referred to in my evidence on the cause. He has previously desired this to be done.Q. On your oath, before this paper was delivered by you at the Judge's chambers, had not Brookes asked for the names of these very persons, and had you not declined to give them - A. I had. I think this was about the 14th or 15th, after I had taken out the summons to produce the cheque. The request was made to me immediately after the trial. He sent a letter to me for the names - I did not answer the letter. Some conversation took place before Mr. Justice Best, that he had not got the names; I said,""Here they are.""Q. I ask you whether at the Judge's chambers, you did not decline giving the names - A. I did not. I think it was on the 14th. I did not deny having said Brookes had made admissions before three of my clerks, or anything like it. He asked for my clerks' names, and I gave them to him, and the Judge commended me for it. This was on the 14th or 15th, when I was before the Judge, in consequence of an order in the other cause. I think the summons was taken out on the 14th, and I attended on the 15th, and then this declaration about the clerks took place.Q. Who was called on the trial to prove Clarke's handwriting - A. Turner. (Looking at a letter) I believe this is the copy of the letter sent me, for the names of the three persons. I have the copy of an affidavit made by Brookes - I think it was sent to me on the 14th or 15th. The draft of an affidavit was delivered to me before I gave him the name - one of the names is my clerk and son. I cannot say whether he was present at the trial - I think he was not.Q. Was he not examined to prove some notice - A.(Looks at a brief.) I think he was examined to prove the service of a notice - he was not examined to prove the acknowledgement. When we were before the Judge about the cheque, the Judge said he should order it into the hands of Isaacson, and if he did not produce it from time to time, the Court would know how to deal with him.Q. What may be the amount of your costs in the causesin which Clarke and Brookes have been engaged - A. I should think upwards of 100 l. up to the middle of June; but my bill is not made out. 50 l. was paid in by Bicknell, on the 17th of June, and afterwards 90 l. I should think I have a claim for 100 l. now.MR. CURWOOD. Q. Have you the money in Court ready to deliver up if the Court order it - A. I have. It came to me from my client, and I thought it my duty to have it here.Q. You gave evidence of a conversation you had with the prisoner on the trial - A. I did, this account was produced as coming from his office - it is a debtor and creditor's account between him and Clarke. I produced it on the part of Clarke; (read.) It appears by this account that Brookes makes himself a debtor of 13 l. 5 s. 6 d., and that was the verdict. I stated in my evidence that the conversation I had with Brookes was in the presence of three of my clerks. I was not served with the summons dated the 13th. I was attending the Judge on the 15th, and on that occasion the names of my clerks were verbally requested. WILLIAM DONALD . I am an agent. I sell goods by commission. I was acquainted with Salmon, a Bow-street officer, and recollect his having purchased a horse of me in December, 1821 - he paid me part in money, and a 15 l. bill. I knew Clarke, and applied to him to get it discounted. I accompanied him to the prisoner's office, in Board-court, Bow-street - I stood outside, and gave Clarke the bill to take to him to get discounted. (A bill was here shewn the witness.) This is the bill; it is drawn by me on Salmon, at two months date, dated the 16th of December. He came out to me - the bill was at last discounted. Clarke handed over to me the proceeds of the bill that instant, at his own house. I never left him till he gave me a cheque for 10 l. on Hodsoll's, also three sovereigns, and 15 s. - 25 s. was allowed for discount. During the time I was with him, he had no opportunity of writing anything on the cheque. I cannot say whether, when the cheque was given to me, there were any figures or name at the back of it. He lives in Bow-street, three or four hundred yards from Brookes's house. He had no opportunity while I was with him of making any writing on it. I do not know whether there was any writing on it. The cheque was paid by Messrs. Hodsoll.Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. How long was Clarke in the office with Brookes - A. It might be a quarter of an hour. It was in December. I do not know the date. GEORGE WARD . I am a hatter, and live in Clare-street, Clare-market. The prisoner called on me, and produced a cheque, on the day before I was to appear at Mr. Justice Best's chambers. He put the cheque into my hands, and asked me if the endorsement on the back was Clarke's hand-writing - I was acquainted with Clarke's writing. There were some figures, and William Clarke , written under them. I told him it was nothing like Clarke's handwriting; that was my opinion on it, and said I would call my wife, who had seen Clarke's hand-writing, to take her opinion on it - she came and said in his presence it was nothing like Clarke's hand-writing, from what she had seen of it. I went several times to Mr. Justice Best's chambers, but did not see the cheque there, or at all after he produced it at my house.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. When you took it in your hand you said you thought it was not the handwriting of Clarke - A. The cheque was not; it was drawn by Brookes, on Messrs. Hodsoll's, for 10 l.; the endorsement was very different to Clarke's writing. I said I was satisfied it was not his writing, but would call my wife to hear her opinion.Q. What opportunities have you of seeing Clarke's writing - A. I had several clubs at his house when he lived in Stanhope-street. I always found his writing a loose straggling hand. He seldom wrote his Christian name at full length - he generally wrote it Wm. I have seen him write William in full on bills. His hand was a very bad one. The endorsement I saw was William at full length under the figures.Q. Look at this paper, what is your belief as to that - A. This has a great resemblance to Clarke's writing - it is at full length. I should take it to be Clarke's writing; I think it something like it. (Looking at another paper,) This is quite the contrary - I should not take it to be anything like his writing.Q. I believe Clarke has some defect in his arm - A. He was thrown out of a gig three or four years ago; whether he has recovered I do not know. THOMAS GOLDSMID . I was examined as a witness in the case of Clarke and Brookes, in the Common Pleas. I was afterwards arrested on the 7th of August for debt, and on the 8th of August I saw the prisoner in Cold Bath-fields prison, (the sheriff's officer had taken my word.) After being in conversation about five minutes, Brookes came down to me from the Governor's house, in company with Clarke. I walked to the end of the garden with him, and he said,""My life is at stake,"" or""My life is in danger; will you swear that is Clarke's hand at the back of the cheque?"" I said I had never seen the cheque, and it was impossible for me to say whether it was, I only saw it as it was handed by the counsel to the Judge, at the trial of the cause - he said""Of course Clarke has told you what I have directed him."" I told him I understood from the papers that the cheque had been destroyed, that I had seen Clarke's writing repeatedly, but if I had seen it, and knew it to be his hand writing, I should have said so. About this time Isaacson and one Bates came in, and Mr. Brookes and Isaacson went up to the other side of the Governor's garden, and stopped about five or ten minutes; Brookes then came back to me, and said,""Any communication you will make to Mr. Isaacson will be the same as making it to me, for really my mind is so agitated I do not know what I am talking of;"" (this was between the first and second examination.) I said I wished to do him no injury, and should not have attended if he had not sent for me. I went outside, and soon after Isaacson came. GRIFFITH HENRY TOOD . I am a cashier at Messrs. Hodsoll, Sterling, and Co's. In December last, the prisoner kept an account at our house. Upon looking at our book, I find on the 18th of December we paid a cheque of his, for 10 l. - the entry in the book is made by Jones, from the cheque itself. The first entry was made in the waste book by Mr. Hodsoll himself. JOSEPH BICKNALL . I am a clerk at Stretton's brew-house.Clarke dealt at our house - I have known him four or five years. I accompanied him to Cold Bath-fields one day, where the prisoner was confined. It was in the summer time, after the prisoner's examinations - I saw him in the garden. I neither held out any promise or threat to him - the conversation was not addressed to me. I heard it from beginning to end. Clarke was requested by the prisoner not to attend at Bow-street - Clarke said he would not, provided money was deposited to pay his expences; Brookes agreed to this. I did not hear Brookes say anything particular before this.Q. Begin the conversation; what first passed - A. Clarke said,""This is Mr. Bicknall from Stretton's,"" and that he wished me to come with them for the purpose they had been talking about the last time they met. Brookes said the expences should be paid. Brookes then gave me a 100 l. Bank note, 25 l. more in Bank notes, and a bill for 25 l. at a short date - it was paid into my hands, and an undertaking was given. I paid 50 l. of the money back to Mr. Hills's brother, and the 100 l. I gave Clarke himself - I gave up the undertaking also. This was ten days or a fortnight ago.Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT PELL. Q. One hundred and fifty pounds was paid over - A. Yes. I paid 50 l. of it to Mr. Hill, brother to the attorney. RICHARD HILL . (Looking at a letter,) This is the prisoner's writing.This letter was read: - It was signed J. B., and addressed to Clarke, entreating his assistance on the prisoner's behalf, and to have no communication with Hill.Another letter, the body of which Mr. Hill deposed to be the prisoner's writing, was read: - It was signed by Clarke, and addressed to Sir Robert Birnie, stating that from circumstances which had come to his knowledge, since the examination, he regretted having gone so far, and begged to be allowed to decline proceeding further. THOMAS JONES . I am clerk to Messrs. Hodsoll and Sterling. I have the book in which I find a cheque entered - drawn by Brookes, in the name of Clarke, on the 18th of December, 1821, for 10 l. - the entry is my writing. I find no other entry of another 10 l. cheque.Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT PELL. Q. Is the entry made from the cheque itself, or from any other book - A. From the cheque. GEORGE HILL . On the 16th of October, I left a copy of this notice at Mr. Hanson's office; he is Mr. Brookes's solicitor. On the 17th, I served a copy on the prisoner in Newgate. I was present at the last attendance on the summons. Mr. Justice Best asked for the cheque, the prisoner hesitated a little while, and said he had not got the cheque; but had taken legal advice, and destroyed it.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Isaacson was present, and had the same opportunity of hearing this as you had - A. Yes.The notice was here read, for the production of the original cheque.The copy of the cheque was here put in, and read.The prisoner, in an exceeding long Defence, stated he had discounted various bills for the prosecutor, Clarke, several of which were dishonoured, and among others he discounted Griffith's; and about a fortnight before that became due, Clarke called with Seager's bill, for 15 l. 10 s., and being told by Turner, the clerk, that the prosecutor was engaged, sent the bill up with a note, desiring 3 l., and stating that the rest would do on the 14th. The prisoner sent down four sovereigns, and on the 17th the prosecutor called and stated that Griffith's bill would not be paid, and asked him to take another, for which the prisoner agreed to do if he approved of it, and between four and five o'clock on the same day Clarke called, and in the back office gave him Salmon's bill, for Griffith's, and then asked for the residue of Seager's bill, and the prisoner gave him 15 s.; he charged 15 s. discount, which with the four sovereigns made cash, 5 l. 10 s., and a cheque for 10 l., and in coming into the front office, the prisoner drew the cheque, endorsed the particulars on it, and handed it to Clarke to sign, which he immediately did; and it was done to show which bill was paid for Griffith's. - The prisoner then made several severe comments on the character of Mr. Hill; stating that he had been advised to do anything to get out of his hands, which was the reason he proposed to compromise the matter, and that he would rather forfeit every farthing he had, than stand at the bar of this Court. - He then stated the case he had to prove, which will appear from the following evidence. JOHN SLEE ISAACSON . I have known the prisoner two or three years. I have been intimate with him during that time. I have known him I suppose seven years. I was attorney in the case of Clarke against Brookes, and am also his attorney in the case against Clarke, who is now in the King's Bench, for trial. My offices were at his house in Broad-court. He occasionally discounts bills for persons. I know Clarke. I was present at Brookes's trial. I recollect a cheque produced, drawn by Brookes, on his bankers, with the endorsement in question on it. I think it was Turner, who swore to the hand-writing of the name of Clarke - Turner is a clerk to me, as well as Brookes. Clarke was present at the trial. I do not think any questions were put to any witness tending to prove the name William Clarke was a forgery; it formed part of Brookes's case. If any such questions had been put to any witness, I believe I must have heard it. The cheque was handed publicly about the Court - I think after it was done with, it was handed at the end of the trial by Mr. Hill to Brookes. I believe Hill made no objection to the cheque. (Looks at the summons dated the 13th of June,) This was obtained by Brookes - I did not serve it, or attend any Judge on this summons. I attended the summons on the 15th, at the time Hill produced this paper. Hill attended in consequence of a summons, and produced the paper with the witnesses's names. I understood from him, that he attended in consequence of the summons. I believe Turner had taken the draft of an affidavit to Hill before that. I attended Mr. Justice Best's chambers on one or two occasions, and was there when application was made to Mr. Brookes to produce the cheque. I stood close to the Judge's table, and heard all that passed - Hill applied for the cheque, and it was produced, and the Judge ordered a copy of it to be delivered to Hill, and that he should have an opportunity of inspecting the original. Mr. Hill afterwards took out a summons for it to be produced before three or four persons - we did not attend the first summons for some days, and then Mr. Hill made an appointment, and we attended. Brookes then refused to produce thecheque; he said he was advised not to produce it, and that he did not intend to go on with the action, and should not produce it - if anything more had been said, I must have heard it. I do not recollect that he said anything else. I do not recollect that he said he had destroyed it. Since the prisoner's committal I have had frequent conversations with Clarke on this business. I am acquainted with Brookes's writing. (Looking at the letter written to Sir Robert Birnie .) He is one of my clerks. This letter is not his writing. I always found him a very honest character.MR. CURWOOD. Q. You are an attorney - A. Yes. My office was in Broad-court, in Brookes's house. He has been my clerk since the 10th of October, 1821. I live in Holborn, and have an office there now. I have lived there since October, 1821. My name is now off Brookes's door; it was put on last April or May; I carried on business till then without any name. I took my name off a fortnight ago. There was no motion pending in Court about me and Brookes when the name was put on the door. He and Turner, his brother-in-law, were my clerks at the time. I swear they were my clerks. I did some business for Clarke, the prosecutor, in the case of Sutherland; I never saw Clarke on the business, it was done by Brookes, my managing clerk. I was present at the trial in the Common Pleas; an account was produced, (looking at it,) it is in Turner's writing. I was not present when it was made; it was produced in evidence, on behalf of the plaintiff. One Astley was called as a witness, and one Mann - I do not recollect that they proved admissions on the part of Brookes - I will not swear they did not, but I do not recollect it. (Looking at a letter,) This is Turner's writing. I dare say it was sent from my office; it is done by my authority, in consequence of the Judge's order. (The letter inclosing a copy of the cheque, was here read.) I was a witness on the trial. After the trial was over, the cheque remained in Brookes's possession - he produced it before the Judge; he did not deliver it to me afterwards. Mr. Justice Best directed it to be delivered into my hands, to be produced at the trial of the cause in the King's Bench, and at chambers. I requested Brookes to deliver it to me; he refused. I do not know whether it is really destroyed or not. I do not recollect hearing Mr. Justice Best say he believed no honourable man would advise the destruction of the cheque. I did not hear Brookes say he felt himself in difficulty. I took out a summons on the 12th, for Mr. Hill to give up the names of the three clerks. There is no endorsement of service at the back of the summons.MR. SERGEANT PELL. Q. You are under recognizance to attend here - A. Yes. Brookes was my managing clerk - I did not live in the house, and it was necessary for him to transact business with many clients, whom I did not see. JAMES TURNER . In December, 1821, I was one of Mr. Isaacson's clerks, and Brooks was also his clerk, and had the principal management of the business. I know William Clarke . Sometime in December, in an afternoon, Clarke came to Mr. Isaacson's office, and brought a bill. I do not recollect rightly what bill it was, but I think I should know it if I saw it - (looking at Seager's bill,) I think this is the bill, which was given me by Mr. Clarke, to be discounted by Mr. Brookes. He was up stairs when Clarke brought it - I took it up to him, and a note written by Clarke.Q. How came he to write a note - A. He called and asked if Mr. Brookes was at home; I said he was engaged with company up stairs - he then said,""Ask him if he can let me have 3 l. or 4 l. on this bill,"" and that the remainder would do in the course of a week or two. I then took up a note from Clarke to Mr. Brookes; (looking at one,) this is the paper I took the bill up in.(read.)Sir, I should be much obliged to you if you will have the goodness to let me have 3 l., on account of the inclosed; the other part will do for me on the 14th of this month. I am, &c.,W. CLARKE. JAMES TURNER re-examined. I took up this paper, with the bill inclosed in it, to Mr. Brookes; he sent down four sovereigns, which I gave to Clarke, and he went away. I saw him again at Mr. Brookes's on the 17th of December - Brookes was up stairs when he came. I do not recollect Clarke's bringing anything then. I went up to Mr. Brookes, and he came down; Clarke was then in the front office; they then went into the back office; I did not follow them; they returned into the front office again. I know Arthur; he came down stairs into the front office, while they were in the back office. When they returned into the front office, they found Arthur there - he kept his bonds in the iron-chest, with Mr. Brookes's permission; he is a broker. I do not exactly recollect what passed when they met in the front office, but Mr. Brookes said something about paying the 1 l. 10 s. I cannot exactly recollect the particulars. Brookes came to his desk, took out his cheque book, and wrote a cheque for 10 l. - I saw the cheque. He gave the cheque to Clarke, and said,""Clarke, you had better endorse this cheque;"" (looking at the duplicate of the cheque,) that is the hand-writing of Mr. Brookes. I saw him tear the cheque off to give to Clarke - I saw him also write something in the margin of the cheque at the time. I do not know whether this was before he tore off the cheque, but it was at the time.Q. Are you certain he said,""Clarke, you had better endorse the cheque"" - A. I am; I have not the least doubt of it, and he did endorse it - Arthur was present during the whole transaction, and after it was over, said something to him about brandy. Clarke went away with the cheque. I know that Griffith's bill was dishonoured.Q. Look at this account, do you know whose writing it is - A. Yes; I wrote it. (This was the account produced on the part of the prosecution.) Clarke came to me with one Mann, for a settlement of the account, between him and Brookes, it was in February last, and at Clarke's desire. I wrote this account by his dictation - Brookes said it was not correct when I took it up stairs to him. I returned with it to Clarke, and told him Brookes said it was not correct, but if he would look in in two or three days he would make a settlement with him. I laid the paper on the desk, and Clarke took it away with him. I think it was the day after the trial that I took a letter from Brookes to Mr. Hill - (looks at it,) this is it, (read.) (This letter was dated the 13th of June, requesting the names of the three clerks, as before stated.) Mr. Hill did not give the names up in consequence of this letter; in consequence ofwhich, I took out a summons the same afternoon, and served a copy of the summons myself that evening. I believe it was to attend next day, but I did not attend the summons myself. A copy of an affidavit was served on Hill that day or the day after. He attended the summons. (Looking at the letter addressed to Sir Robert Birnie ,) The body of this letter is certainly not in Brookes's writing. (Looking at two letters,) I have no doubt but these are both Clarke's writing.MR. ALLEY. Q. You have been employed by the prisoner, in what capacity - A. I am clerk to Isaacson. Mr. Brookes managed the business. I never knew that the prisoner was an attorney, nor ever heard that he passed as one. Clarke has employed him repeatedly since I have been in the office; but whether he employed him as an attorney or not, I do not know. I have lived there two years. Isaacson has an office in Holborn now, but had not in December last. The account produced is in my hand-writing; but I wrote it by Clarke's desire.Q. Did you not bring it down stairs, and deliver it yourself as a settled account to Mann - A. I did not. I was examined at Westminster Hall; the original cheque was produced there. I think I swore that I believed it was Clarke's writing.Q. You have swore to day you saw Clarke write the endorsement - A. Yes, I did. I was not asked at Westminster Hall, if I saw him write it. I attended the first and third examinations at Bow-street - I was not summoned to attend the second, and did not go, as there was nobody to attend to the business. If I had been wanted I could have been fetched in a moment. I was in and out most all day.Q. Did you keep out of the way - A. No. The copy of the cheque was produced at the first examination. I said I had no recollection of making the copy; but it was very similar to my hand-writing. I at first said I did not know whose writing it was, and that I did not recollect writing it. The examination was between six and seven o'clock in the evening. I did not know where Brookes was - I wanted to see him particularly. The servant said he was gone with Salmon to Bow-street. I went into the office and found him in custody, and was so completely astonished I scarcely know what I said, for I had not been in the place above ten minutes before I was examined.MR. SERGEANT PELL. Q. You were taken under circumstances of great surprise at Bow-street - A. Yes. I had not the slightest reason to expect I should find him in custody, and it agitated me.COURT. Q. By whom were you paid your wages - A. Sometimes by Brookes, and sometimes by Isaacson. I was paid weekly, and Brookes was paid weekly.HENRY ARTHUR. I am a broker of the City. On the 17th of December, I lived at Mr. Brookes's house, in Broad-court. I had lived there about four years. I had the privelege of all the house, and slept in the top room, and had the use of the iron-chest in the front office. I have seen Clarke. I saw him in Brookes's house, some days before Christmas day, it was about five o'clock in the evening. Mr. Turner was sitting in the front office. I was putting some Spanish bonds in the iron-case, and Brookes came from the back office, followed by Clarke. The desk is divided by a railing - the iron-chest is outside the rail. Turner sat opposite Mr. Brookes, within the rail. Brookes sat down within the rail, on a stool - Clarke stood at the corner of a desk by Brookes, within the rail, and about the length of the desk, which came about a yard from him. Brookes was writing - I could not see what he was writing. While he was writing, I heard him tell Clarke to sign the back of the cheque; Clarke leant over as if he was signing - I did not see a pen in his hand, as his back was turned to me. As he was going away, I told him to let me have a gallon of brandy as good as that he had let Mr. Brookes have - he said he could not warrant what he had, but he expected some from Sir Robert Bennett 's, a wine-merchant, at Vauxhall, and when it came he would send it. He sent some afterwards. I have known Brookes about eight years, and always found him honest.MR. CURWOOD. Q. You saw Clarke and Brookes come out of the front office - A. I did. I saw no cheque-book. I am certain Brookes told Clarke to sign the back of the cheque, not the back of the bill. I attended at Westminster Hall to prove this. MARTIN NOWLAND BATES . (Looking at the letter written to Sir Robert Biruie ,) The body of this letter was written by me. I have been intimate with Brookes for five or six years - he is a respectable man.MR. ALLEY. Q. What way of life are you in - A. An artist; employed by people. Mr. Bish employs me now. I have not done much lately, as my health is bad. I live in Upper John-street, Fitzroy-square. I have occasionally lived at a house kept by the prisoner's mother, in Lower Newman-street. I never received anything from her for any service. The last work I carried home was to Mr. Power, a music-seller, in the Strand.MR. HOWARD. I am an attorney. (Looking at the two signatures, W. Clarke, referred to in Ward's evidence.) I have frequently seen Clarke write, and believe both these to be his writing, certainly. He has been a client of mine.MR. CURWOOD. Q. You believe them both to be his writing - A. I do.Q. Look at the back of this bill - A. I believe that to be his writing. I think I should take that bill as his endorsement. (This was the bill for which the cheque was given.)

I am the brother of James Gough , a timber-merchant, who lives in Shoreditch. Manley, the watchman, brought three live fowls to the house, before six o'clock in the morning of the 4th of August. The prisoner was in custody. They were kept in a hen-house - I had seen them safe the evening before, about dusk, as they were going to roost. There were six of them; they usedto go out into the street - they were all safe then. William-street is parallel with the timber-yard. MICHAEL MANLEY . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, about five minutes before five o'clock, I heard watch called; I went up, and saw the prisoner running with this bag in his hand - I pursued, and overtook him. and asked what he had in it; he said fowls, and I found three live fowls in it. He said a boy gave them to him; he did not know who he was, or where he lived. I took him to the watch-house. RICHARD SPRINGER . I am a bed-post carver, and live in John-street, Curtain-road, nearly opposite Gough's. I was looking out of the window a little before five o'clock in the morning and saw the prisoner and another man driving the fowls from William-street, into Le Blanc-buildings, which is no thoroughfare. The prisoner went down the buildings to lay hold of them, and the other stood at the entrance to prevent them from getting out; the prisoner had a bag; when he went out of the buildings I saw he had got them in the bag. They came by my house, and I charged them with stealing the fowls; they denied it. I called watch, and they ran off. The watchman took the prisoner; the other escaped.

WILLIAM PATERSON . I am a boot and shoe maker, and live in the Broadway, Westminster. On the 4th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in my kitchen, which joins the shop, and hearing a noise, I went to the door, and somebody exclaimed,""They are robbing your shop."" There was a mob at the door. I went round to the window outside - (a pane of glass had been cracked, and mended with putty,) a piece of it had been moved on one side. I missed a pair of lady's boots, which had been near the pane - I had seen them there a little before three o'clock. The prisoner Fry was brought to me in two minutes by Hill; he was accused by Ryan, of putting his hand through my windows, and denied it, and said he had just come up Tothill-street, which is at the corner of my house. JOSEPH HILL . I am a constable. I came up to the prosecutor's shop almost immediately after this happened. Paterson said he had been robbed - Ryan pointed out Fry, who was mixing in the crowd. I took him, but found nothing on him. I did not see Ward there; I took him on the Sunday, in the Almonry. SAMUEL RYAN . I was eleven years old in September last. On the night of the 4th of October, between seven and eight o'clock, I was running by the shop, and heard the noise of the glass breaking. I saw Ward with his hand in the window, and he had the glass in his hand. Fry and Ward were both standing together, and then they went to a post and stopped - Fry then went to the window, put his hand in, and took something out, and put it under his coat; he went over the way. I could not see what it was. I was just by the curb when I heard the glass break. Fry went over to the baker's shop, and gave the things from under his coat to another boy, (not Ward) - he came back, put his hand in the window again, and took something out; I could not tell what, and then went over and gave it to the same boy. I saw the window was quite close, and puttied the day before. There was a candle in the window.I did not know them before. I am sure they are the boys. WILLIAM HATTON . I am eleven years old. I was by Mr. Paterson's shop on this night, going on an errand. I saw Ward put his hand into the window; he then went into the middle of the road, and called another boy to him, who is not here.

LOUISA OWEN . I live in St. Ann's-lane, Westminster. I live servant with my aunt, Margaret Mounsell , who is a widow, and rents the house. On Thursday, the 3d of October, I lost a hair trunk out of the second floor room, containing the articles stated in the indictment. I saw the trunk about five o'clock. I went to bed about nine o'clock, and it was gone. Proud was at the house about four o'clock that day, and Jenkins about three - I did not see them after four o'clock. I have found none of my property. Some little things were found in Jenkins's cellar the same night, about a quarter before ten o'clock; I was present when they were found - it consisted of patchwork, which had been in my trunk; they are here. I produce part of them - here is a piece, which I had a gown of myself. Jenkins was at the watch-house when it was found; I had caused him to be apprehended at the Castle, public-house, Broadway. Jenkins's mother keeps the house the pieces were found in, and he cuts wood in the cellar with Proud; the things were worth 10 l. I I was at home from five till nine o'clock, and heard nobody come in or go out; a rope was found at the top of the house, to which they must have slung the box, and let it down. MARGARET MOUNSELL . I am a widow, and keep the house; it is in the parish of St. John, Westminster, I believe - I pay taxes to St. John's and St. Margaret's. WILLIAM GOUGH . I am patrol. I locked up Jenkins on the night of the 3d of October, and then went to a cellar where he and Proud chopped wood, at No. 37, Orchard-street, and found these bits of patchwork, which I have kept ever since. THOMAS PACE . I belong to Queen's-square. I was with Jenkins at Turpin's, in Dartmouth-street, a little after six o'clock in the morning, in company with Greenhill the watch-house keeper. Jenkins took us there, to shew us where the property was, but we found none of it; he pointed out the person, to whom he said he sold it. I examined the premises; and on the front garret parapet were marks of boy's feet, and marks on the wall where the box had been let down - the prisoner's feet are about the same size. LOUISA OWEN re-examined. I saw the marks on the parapet of my window; I swear to this patchwork.JENKINS'S Defence. Proud was not in my company all the evening.PROUD'S Defence.

t18221023-7,theft,theftFromPlace,transport,none,18221023,"SARAH PERRY was indicted for that she being servant to Edward Byers , did steal on the 17th of October, three gowns, value 30 s.; six caps, value 48 s., and one pelisse, value 20 s., his property, in the dwelling-house of William Odell . EDWARD BYERS . I lodge in Trevess-square, Westminster; the house is William Odell 's. Prisoner was servant of all work to me for about three weeks; she slept in the front kitchen, which is below stairs; there is an area in front, secured by iron pallisades. On Thursday, the 17th of this month, about half past four o'clock in the morning, my family were disturbed by the prisoner (I and my wife slept in the first floor back room); she said there was a thief in the house, who had been up to her beside, on the side adjoining the kitchen door. I went down with my wife and Mr. and Mrs. Odell, and found the door closed as it was the night before; the kitchen window, which opens downwards, was partly open. I found nobody in the house. There was a table near the window, which was white deal - had any one come in with dirty feet, there must have been impressions on it, but there were none, nor any marks on the cill, either inside or outside. On going into the kitchen, the clothes which had been washed the preceding day hung on the horse; and on enquiring of her what was stolen, she said she had ironed three dresses of my wife's, three lace caps, and two or three night caps, and hung them on the horse last night; and that the thief must have taken them. I immediately went to the watchman, who was calling half-past four o'clock; he came in, and stated in her presence, that at four o'clock, on going his rounds, he observed the kitchen shutters open, a candle burning, and the clothes horse covered with clothes. I examined the doors, and finding them all secure, I suspected her, and gave her in charge; she was taken to the watch-house; she was undressed when she came to my room. My wife and myself and Mr. Odell's servant made search, and on examining the prisoner's bed, between the bed and sacking, we found the identical articles stated in the indictment (which she had stated to be stolen), put up in a bundle - the caps were lace. My wife found a pelisse in another part of the bed. When the prisoner was given in charge, she was sitting on the bed, on the spot under which the bundle was found, and expressed great reluctance to quit that place.MRS. BYERS. I am the wife of the last witness. This property is ours. When my husband went to the watch-house with the prisoner, I remained in the kitchen sometime, and then we all went up stairs; we did not put the bundle in the bed. I had missed the pelisse two or three days before from the drawer, and told her; but upon her expressing a doubt of having even seen it, I thought I might have put it in a trunk up stairs. I had worn the other things while she lived with us, but had not seen the pelisse. The property is worth about 30 s. second hand. SOPHIA OAKLEY . I was servant to Mr. Odell at the time. I searched the place with the prosecutor, and saw the things found - I never put them there; they were all rolled up in a bundle, except the pelisse. I used to go into the kitchen now and then. On the night before the robbery, she asked me to sleep with her, and said something came over her that the house would be robbed that night - I declined; but said I would tell the watchman to watch the house - she said,""No, nonsense."" I told her to bar the window up; she said, Oh! no, how was she to get up in the morning.Prisoner. Q. Did I never ask you to sleep with me before - A. Yes. I went to her bed one night, because my own was hard, and I could not sleep. I had nothing to do with the wash. HENRY RANCE . I am a watchman. The house is in my beat. Byers called me at half-past four o'clock - I went into the house. I had been in my proper place all night - my box is near the house. I saw no attack made on the house; I should have heard it if any had been made. I observed before four o'clock, that the window was open, and a light burning and the clothes on the horse, before the fire. When I went into the house, the prisoner said there had been a thief there - she said she saw him, and that she supposed he came in by the window; that he was a stout jolly lad, and that he came close to her bed-side; that she did not see him go away, for she was alarmed, and ran up stairs to call her master. She mentioned what was missing. It was a dirty night, and nobody could have come in without making a dirt there - on the cill and table there was none. I took her to the watch-house.Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you had been to Brompton-row - A. That is in my beat, and is not twenty yards off. I was calling half-past four.(Property produced and sworn to.)GUILTY.

t18221023-8,theft,housebreaking,death,none,18221023,"WILLIAM CROUCHER and CHARLES HENNINGTON were indicted for breaking and entering the dwelling-house of William Smith , about the hour of seven in the forenoon, of the 2d of October, at St. Martin in the fields, (no person being therein,) and stealing therein one coat, value 50 s.; six handkerchiefs, value 30 s.; one pin, value 5 s.; one shawl, value 5 s.; eight spoons, value 30 s.; one crown; three half-crowns; twelve shillings, and seven sixpences , the property of Daniel O'Brien .SUSANNAH O'BRIEN. I am the wife of Daniel O'Brien; we live in Blue-cross-street, in the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields; we rent the kitchen; William Smith is the landlord, and lives in the house. On Wednesday, the 2d of October, I went out about a quarter after seven o'clock in the morning; I left my daughter Mary Ann Isaacs in the house; I returned about half-past eight; Isaacs was not there - she returned in quarter of an hour; I then got in, as she had the key. I found my husband's large chest broken open, and a large drab great coat and the rest of the property stated in the indictment gone. There were three half-crowns and one crown among the silver. I have found nothing since. I found a milk kettle left on the table in the kitchen, which was not there before. When I went out that morning, I saw the two prisoners standing in the street against a post opposite, at the corner, four or five doors from each other. Hennington stood at the post, with the same sort of kettle in his hand as that I found in the kitchen. I had seen them waiting about there three mornings before, on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday; they were dressed like milkmen; Croucher had a blue apron, the other had a dark blue coat, and a smart orange-coloured handkerchief on; I took particular notice of him being so smart. My daughter called my attention to them on the Monday morning, and as I was going round with my milk on Wednesday, about a quarter of an hour after I left home (about half-past seven o'clock) I saw Hennington running down Hemming's-row, with a light great coat on, like the one missed. I did not see Croucher then.Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Croucher had a blue apron on, that is all that made him look like a milkman - A. Yes; we called them the dandy milkmen. Hennington was dressed genteelly, and stood about twelve yards off, with a kettle in his hand, of the same size as that I found in the room; there are many kettles of that size. I afterwards saw him running with the coat on, and am sure of his person, for I particularly noticed him; it was a large drab old-fashioned coat, and too big for him; I saw his face, and also saw that he had the same orange-coloured handkerchief on, and knew him again. The kitchen has a door leading into the passage, communicating with the rest of the house; Mrs. Smith and her two children were in the house at the time.COURT. Q. What is the value of the coat? A. My husband gave three guineas and a half for it; it is worth 2 l. - he had worn it very little. The other things are worth 65 s. MARY ANN ISAACS . I am the daughter-in-law of Mrs. O'Brien. I went out on Wednesday morning, about a quarter past seven o'clock, about two minutes after my mother; I locked the back door twice, and left the key inside; the front door was latched - I left it fast; I returned about half-past seven o'clock; I looked down the cellar, to see if there was any customer - I saw two men open the street door of the house and come out; I looked very hard at them - the prisoners are the men. Croucher had a black waistcoat, black silk handkerchief, and dark blue coat and blue trowsers; Hennington had a darkish brown old fashioned great coat on. They said nothing to me. I watched them up the street, and went down into the kitchen directly, and found the back door wide open, and a strange milk can on the table. My father-in-law's chest was broken open. I immediately missed his coat, also my own shawl out of my box. I went and met my mother and told her. I did not suspect the men then. The great coat one had on was like my father-in-law's. I have seen the prisoners several times before - I saw Croucher on the Monday morning before the robbery with a milk kettle in his hand - Isaw him several times in the course of Monday, and many times on the Tuesday. I saw Hennington also on the Tuesday; he had a coloured silk handkerchief on. I saw them together several times on the Monday and Tuesday - I did not know where they lived, or their names.Cross-examined. Q. It was an old great coat - A. No, an old fashioned one - he never wore it since I have been with him, which is two years. I saw Croucher on Monday, going along with the milk can in his hand, and Hennington following him - I do not say they were together then. The back door leads to the kitchen stairs. GEORGE AVIS . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 3d of October. in consequence of information, I apprehended both the prisoners about three o'clock in the afternoon, in Vine-street, Chandos-street, in the street; they were in company with a third person; both had black silk handkerchiefs. I searched them, and on Hennington I found an orange-coloured silk handkerchief. I got the milk can from the premises. I was fetched directly, and saw it found. SUSANNAH O'BRIEN . That is the colour of the handkerchief Hennington had on. FRANCES SMITH . My husband rents the house in Blue-cross-street. On the morning before the robbery (Tuesday) I saw two men come up the back way from the kitchen; I looked at them - they were respectably dressed, and not knowing but they belonged to the people in the kitchen, I took no further notice; they appeared to be exactly like the prisoners. Next morning I went to the shop door to look after my son, who was gone on an errand, and saw the same two men going down the front way into the kitchen down the cellar stairs, and about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I heard of the robbery. I cannot swear positively to the prisoners - they were very much like them; neither had a great coat on; I did not notice their dresses particularly, only they appeared well dressed.Cross-examined. Q. You thought them well dressed - A. Yes. The prisoners appear very much like them. RICHARD DAWKINS . I am a milkman, and live at Plumtree-street, Bloomsbury. On the 2d of October, about twenty minutes after seven o'clock in the morning I was in Hemming's-row, St. Martin's-lane; it is near Bluecross-street; I saw two men, one had a blue coat and trowsers, and the other a large drab great coat on. I heard a great rattling in their pockets as they passed me, which appeared like silver or money of some sort. I will not swear it was the prisoners. THOMAS EVANS . I am a milkman. The milk kettle produced is mine. I have known Croucher five years. I cannot say he had the kettle, but I lodged at his father's house at one time, and sometimes I lent him a can like this. I cannot say whether he always returned it. I have lost ten or twenty cans in the course of the year.Cross-examined. Q. He was apprenticed to his uncle - A. I understand so. I left his father's house three years ago; I was a milkman then, and am so now. I sold some of my old cans to a Mrs. Lizard, but not this, as none that I sold her had my name on.CROUCHER'S Defence. I was in a different place at the time.HENNINGTON'S Defence. I was not in that part of the town. GEORGE CROUCHER . I am the prisoner's father. He was apprenticed to his uncle, who is a glazier to the Corporation of London. He was with him nearly seven years - they separated four or five months ago, having some altercation; he has chiefly lived me since. On Wednesday morning, the 2d of October, he came home about half-past six o'clock - he had not slept at home. I sat in his company from that time till twenty minutes before seven o'clock. I live in Castle-court, Strand. He then went out, and returned about ten minutes before eight o'clock. He was dressed in a blue coat and round hat. I have seen Hennington before, but never knew my son to be acquainted with him. My son sometimes worked with me, and at times had jobs of his own. I am a mangler and porter. He was with me on Tuesday, till twelve or one o'clock, all the morning. He did not get up till eight, and was at home on Monday till twelve o'clock. He slept at home on Sunday and Monday nights. JAMES PRESCOD . I am a butcher, and live in Croucher's house. I remember something about the day this robbery took place. I believe it was on a Wednesday. I saw Croucher in the passage with his father, about a quarter before seven o'clock. He bore an honest industrious character. I did not see him after a quarter to seven o'clock; we walked together from the house at that time, to near where I work; I got there about ten minutes to seven o'clock. I work at Collinson's, Holborn, near the Turnstile. I then left him, and cannot say which way he went.Another witness gave Croucher a good character. FRANCES SMITH re-examined. It was between seven and eight o'clock on Tuesday morning that I saw two men come out of the kitchen. I live a very little way from Castle-court, Strand.CROUCHER - GUILTY - DEATH .

t18221023-9,theft,burglary,death,none,18221023,"WILLIAM HOLLAND and JOHN BARNETT were indicted for burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Charles Clayton , about the hour of seven in the night of the 20th of September, at St. Marylebone, with intent to steal .MR. ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution. CHARLES CLAYTON . I keep the Old George, public-house, in Oxford-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone. On Friday, the 20th of September, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, (I am certain about the time,) I was standing at my bar with the servant at my side, in the usual course of my business - two persons came in; my lamps were alight in all part of the house, and the street lamps also.Q. Suppose you had gone out and seen your wife or son twenty yards off, should you have known them - A. No, not by the daylight. Two persons came into my house to the front bar - the front door is in Oxford-street; I have also a side entrance in Old George-yard, the entrance to Mr. Bushnell's coach-yard. Customers come in at the front door, but some come in at the side, as well as the lodgers,I never recollect seeing either of the two men before. Barnett was one of them. My servant was in the room last before the alarm. My bedroom is the first floor back room; I have a contrivance by which if any one enters that room a bell rings violently in my bar. Nobody but my family have a right to go into the room - the key hangs in the bar. While the two men were drinking in the bar the bell rang, and in consequence of what my servant said I ran immediately up stairs to my bed-room, and met Holland four or five yards from the door, on the third step of the stairs. I did not know him before; I could not see his face; I demanded to know who he was; I believe he said,""Who are you?"" or""What is it to you?"" Upon which I said,""Somebody has entered my room, and you are the first man I met, and I will secure you."" On my seizing him, he caught hold of my collar and a struggle ensued; we came a few steps down, and I called for a light; my servant immediately left the bar, and brought me a candle, and while I was struggling, the other two men, whom I had left at the bar, passed my servant, and I was collared by some person behind, who pulled me and Holland down the stairs together; we fell down together, and the third man knocked the candle out of the servant's hand just before we fell. Holland immediately got on his feet, and made out at the side door; I started the very moment after him. I was on my feet as soon as him, and was never above half a yard from him; he turned out into Oxford-street, then to the left hand, ran against a person, and I caught him, and he was secured. I took him back into my parlour, and said I suspected I had been robbed. Upon going up into my bed-room with a candle, I found the door open - nothing was gone. I returned down stairs, and fastened my side door, and left two persons to guard it. I then went to the bar with a large stick, and was bolting the front door in Oxford-street. I heard a scuffle behind me in the bar, and saw Barnett struggling with two or three men - he had a stick in his hand - he was secured. I did not see him searched.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you sure you never lost sight of Holland - A. Never. I have six or seven lodgers; the side-door is for their use, and persons coming to them. A bookbinder lodged with me - he died six weeks before; his name was taken off the door two days before the transaction. Holland said he had been up stairs after the bookbinder, but did not know his name: his room was on the same floor as my bed-room. I have but one staircase.Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. How long were Barnett and the other man at the bar before the bell rang - A. Three or four minutes; my servant had given them a glass of rum and water - the other man asked me to drink. I cannot say who the persons were who came behind when I was struggling with Holland.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How far is the bookbinder's door from yours - A. Nearly opposite; his widow remained there, and was at home at the time; she has moved now. Some implements of housebreaking were brought to me from the parlour afterwards.COURT. Q. Suppose the door had been left open half an inch, if any person gave it a shove, would the bell ring - A. Yes, my Lord. I do not think it could have been left ajar; I had not been up there after eleven o'clock. The bell does not ring when the door shuts; there were no marks of violence on the door, but by some means the bolt was put back. MARY HERSLOPE . I am in Mr. Clayton's service as barmaid. On the 20th of September I was in my master's bed-room, at six o'clock in the evening; I put the bell spring on the door when I came out, locked the door after me, and took the key down, and hung it up in the bar - I am sure I locked it. I was in the bar when the bell rang; I had been out of the bar for a few minutes before that, but when the bell rang, the key was still where I had hung it. I did not see the two persons come in to drink. When the bell rang, my master went up stairs - he called for a light - I went towards the stairs with a candle. At that time Barnett and another man stood at the bar - they both passed me in the passage, and the other man, who has escaped, knocked the light out of my hand; and before that, Barnett ran on the stairs, and took my master by the collar, and pulled him down, and then the candle was knocked out. I saw no more - I went to the bar. Barnett came and paid me for the rum and water - I took the money. I saw Holland brought back; Barnett stood at the bar then, and did not offer to run away.COURT. Q. The front door was open all that time - A. It was not fastened. Barnett remained at the bar four or five minutes before Holland was brought back. My master went to the door to fasten it; Barnett went and held up a stick to strike him, but was prevented by somebody who was by - he was taken into the parlour.Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. He paid for his rum and water and was going away, and your master stopped him - A. Yes; he held his stick up; he did not attempt to do any thing before my master endeavoured to stop him. I told the Magistrate about Barnett's collaring my master on the stairs; they did not say they had come to help him. I should think the stairs are about a yard wide. I stood at the foot of the stairs (not on them) when the man passed me, and knocked the light out - it was not done by accident. I know it was dark at the time; for I had been at the front door just before, and it was quite pitch dark.Q. Then inside the house, with the candle put out, how could you see - A. There was a light from the bar. I left the room about six o'clock - the alarm was above an hour after.COURT. Q. Did not you say, when you were examined before, that you had not been out of the bar from the time you locked the door, till it happened - A. Not that I know of. My master's back was towards Barnett when he raised the stick to strike him; also when he went up stairs to pull him down. JOSEPH DOWNES ALLEN . I am a Clerk in the Bank of England. On the 20th of September, a little past seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Oxford-street, coming from the city; I went into Clayton's house; it was dark in the street - I should think it was a quarter or twenty minutes past seven o'clock; there was not sufficient light for one man to know the countenance of another in the street; it had been dusk for forty minutes before I went in. My attention was attracted by a crowd round the prosecutor's house; and on going in, there was a great confusion inside. I saw Holland in the parlour, sitting near the window, withhis right hand towards the window; and while he sat there he took a letter out of his pocket, which he was going to tear up; some persons prevented him, and in the mean time I heard something drop from him. I said to the persons about me,""Take care of your pockets;"" and a short time after that, Barnett was in the room, and I saw him take something off the table, as I thought. I tapped the landlord on the shoulder, and in consequence of what I said to him he (the landlord) immediately went out of the bar towards the front door - Barnett went out rather behind him - he went and bolted the front door. Barnett lifted up a stick which he had in his hand, and was going to level it at the landlord's head - I prevented him - he immediately turned round, and swore he would knock me down, if I prevented his going out, saying he had particular business, and would go. The landlord had bolted the door. Barnett walked to the bar - I observed him put something into the left side of his coat; I saw him afterwards throw a dark lantern down in the parlour; I picked it up, and accused him of throwing it down - he denied it - I gave it to the landlord. A phosphorus bottle and picklock key were found in the grate immediately behind Barnett. Nobody was so near the grate as him - nobody but him had an opportunity of putting them there - he sat with his back to the fire-place. We attempted to secure him; he struck me with his stick several times.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. He said he would strike you or any person who prevented his going out, as he had particular business - A. Yes. There might be ten persons in the parlour where the grate was. I did not see the phosphorus bottle found. It is a good-sized room.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had you passed any church, to know the time - A. St. Giles's clock struck seven as I was in Broad-street, a little beyond Drury-lane, but not so far as Middle-row. Clayton's is nearly opposite Dean-street, which is ten minutes walk. I had called at a snuff-shop for about ten minutes, in the way. I got to Clayton's a quarter or twenty minutes after seven o'clock, and saw a crowd round the house before I arrived. It was dark when I heard the clock strike; I could not then discern a man's countenance. The alarm had taken place before I got to Clayton's.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the persons in the parlour come in before or after you - A. Some before and some after.COURT. Q. Did you pick up more than one picklock key - A. I did not pick it up; I saw but one found - that was in the grate or on the hearth.Q. Have you always said it was near to where Barnett was sitting - A. To the best of my knowledge.Q. Have you not said it was picked up off the ground where Holland sat - A. They both sat in the same situation. CHARLES PARRINGTON . I was at the prosecutor's on this night, before the alarm. I was in the parlour when I heard the first noise; eight or ten people were then in the parlour - I went out of the house on being called away. I was standing at the bar, and saw Barnett attempt to strike Clayton as he was fastening the door - he went away then to the other, and said if he could not get out at one door he would at the other. I held the door, and said he should not. A scuffle ensued between us, and I took the stick from him, and gave it to Clayton. WILLIAM WOOL . I am a coachmaker, and live next door to Clayton. I saw Holland being pursued towards St. Giles's. I think he came out of Clayton's front door. It was quite dark then. JOHN GUINT . I was in Perry's-place, opposite Clayton's house on the 21st of September, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, and found four skeleton keys, about ten yards from the door, in Oxford-street, behind a stone in Perry's-yard - they appeared to have been laid there. CHARLES CLAYTON re-examined. The prisoners were taken out of my house by the constable, at the front door, near this spot - they would not have to pass the place where the keys were found. My parlour is particularly light; it is all a glass front. I should suppose that Holland was taken not above three minutes after the two persons came in - it could not have exceeded five. A phosphorus box, a picklock key, and a dark lantern were given me by the witness, and somebody brought me some matches. None of them are mine. ROBERT MOSS . I am a constable. Clayton gave the prisoners in charge, with the dark lantern and other things. JAMES SEYMOUR . I saw Holland running outside Clayton's house - he was secured, and taken in; I went in, and in the parlour where he was, I picked up a few matches; some of them were under where he sat, and some by the seat by the fire. Barnett was not sitting by the matches at that time.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many other persons were in the room - A. A number of others; but none so near the matches as Holland. I gave them to some man in the room. JAMES TOWERS . I am a constable. I took Barnett into custody, and found a large knife on him at the watch-house. As I was taking him along, he made several faint attempts to escape, by endeavouring to snatch his hand from under my arm, and to trip me up two or three times.HOLLAND'S Defence. I came out of the country, and was in town about twelve days. I wanted to get some books bound, and was recommended to a binder at Clayton's - I went there about seven o'clock, knocked at the door on the right hand side up stairs, several times; nobody answered - I turned to the other door to knock, and it instantly flew open. I heard the prosecutor cry out that he was robbed, and came down to get out, thinking he might suspect me to be implicated.BARNETT'S Defence. I went in to have some rum and water - there was a piece of work on the stairs. I went there with other people. Clayton was coming down with two or three people - I was rather in liquor, and he nearly pushed me down. I went back to the bar, and finished my glass.Three witnesses gave Barnett a good character.HOLLAND - GUILTY - DEATH . Aged 24.BARNETT - GUILTY - DEATH .

JANE BERWICK . I am the wife of James Berwick , who is a hatter - we live in Bishopsgate-street. The watch was on our mantle-piece in the parlour, at the end of the shop - it was silver gilt, and had a gold seal, and two keys to it; one metal and the other gold; they are worth 5 l. together. On the 29th of July, I saw it safe at half-past twelve o'clock, and about one the prisoner came in to enquire about a first floor we had to let; he had been twice before, on the same business. I am quite sure of his person. I shewed him the apartments, of which he approved; he was sometime talking in the parlour. He said he took them for two friends of his in the Bank, and requested me to fetch him pen, ink, and paper, as he had no card in his pocket. I went into the counting-house, (which joins the parlour) for it; I left him alone - I was absent about a minute, and as I returned, he met me, and took the pen and ink from me, saying he would not give me the trouble to come into the parlour, and wrote on the card on the end of the counter,""Dupree, Nelson-square, Blackfriars-road,"" and went away. I missed the watch immediately he was gone - nobody but him could have taken it. I am quite sure it was in the parlour when I went for the pen and ink. He was taken into custody on the Monday following.Prisoner. Q. Did you leave me in the parlour while you went to see if the rooms were ready for my seeing them - A. That was the first time he came.Q. Did you ask any clerk in the Bank to get you any lodgers - A. Mr. Berwick most likely did. I told him Mr. Berwick would require a respectable reference, and that he knew a Mr. Smith in the Bank. RICHARD MYERS . I am shopman to Mr. Berwick. I recollect the prisoner coming after the lodging. I did not know where the watch was. I was informed it was stolen. I went out to look for the man, but could not find him. On the Sunday after, I saw the prisoner in Long-lane, and charged him with stealing the watch - he said I was mistaken in the person; that he had never been in Bishopsgate-street about any apartments. I am certain he is the man. He said he was going to meet a friend in St. John-street, and would satisfy me he was not the person. I walked up that way with him - he then said he would take me to his lodging. He ran away from me, but I took him without losing sight of him. The metal watch key was taken from his person at Giltspur-street, by Taylor. I saw him come to the house the day the watch was stolen, and on one day before.Prisoner. Q. You saw me the first day I called - A. Yes. I saw you pass through the shop. I was examined before Mr. Alderman Waithman, and did not say I was not at home on the day it was stolen. I was asked why I took such particular notice of him, and said I noticed his shabby hat and boots. When I saw him in Long-lane, he turned into a hair dresser's shop, and disguised himself as I understand. I stopped, and met him coming out. I cannot say whether he saw me, and when we got nearly to the corner of Long-lane, he turned back and ran away on seeing Taylor. I followed, and caught him by Carthusian-street. WILLIAM TAYLOR . I am a constable. On Sunday, the 4th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I was meeting the prisoner - two men were following him; Myers told me to take him into custody; I asked for what; he said he was a thief. I looked behind, and he was running off as hard as he could. I ran to Charterhouse-lane to meet him, and found him in the hands of Myers, and found the watch key on him at the Compter.(Key produced and sworn to.)Prisoner's Defence. I was apprehended early in the last vacation, and my time was postponed last Session, for the prosecutrix's convenience, which has deprived me of the important evidence of Dupree and Lawrence, who employed me to take the lodgings. They are now returned to their native country. They would have convinced the Court, I did not introduce myself into Berwick's house to accomplish a premeditated theft; but was employed by them to take the lodging. JANE BERWICK . After the watch was stolen, neither Dupree or any one else called. RICHARD MYERS . I went to Nelson-square, and found no such person as Dupree lived there.GUILTY.

JOHN INGRAM . I belong to the Prince Regent fishing vessel, which lay off Billingsgate. On the 3d of this month, I left the vessel about ten o'clock in the morning, and returned about twelve. I left my property in the vessel; there were three sovereigns and a half in my jacket pocket, which was in my box, not locked up; the prisoner was a stranger. When I returned, I missed my watch immediately, which hung in the bed cabin; I afterwards missed the other things. I took the prisoner next day at the head of Billingsgate market with the jacket on. I have found nothing else. I told him he was the man I was looking for - he made no answer, but pretended to be in liquor, and I think he was. I gave him in charge. THOMAS INGRAM . I belong to the vessel, and left it about the same time as my brother. My clothes were safe. I had a pair of trowsers, a hat, a shirt, and two Chelmsford one-pound notes in my pocket-book, in my box - the trowsers were on the bed. I returned about one o'clock, and missed them. I saw the prisoner when he was taken; he had my brother's jacket, and my trowsers, shirt, and hat on him. I found the prisoner's old clothes in the cabin. JOHN RYDER . I work at Billingsgate market.

I left the shop at four o'clock in the afternoon, and shut up the workshop. I only latched it, not locked it - it was all safe then; I did not go there again till three o'clock in the afternoon of Sunday. I found the door which is in my garden open, and the property gone. I traced footsteps of a full grown man over some loose mould and sand, from the place over the wall, where I supposed the person had escaped. I could not judge whether they were the steps of more than one person. I went to the prisoner's mother's house last Monday, which was a fortnight after the robbery. I found there a copper box, which I had lost, and which contained the gold; a tea cannister was also there. I found a pair of gold ear-rings at the prisoner's lodging; he was a stranger to me. I was at home from four o'clock on Saturday, till three on Sunday. I am certain I had latched the door. MARY ANN BANNISTER . I am the wife of the prosecutor. I saw the property safe at ten o'clock on Saturday morning, and at ten o'clock on Sunday morning I saw the shop door open - I thought my husband was in there, and did not say anything. Between three and four o'clock the robbery was discovered. I think the person had entered by the gate. I had heard footsteps on Saturday night, about half-past eleven o'clock, coming up the yard, which leads to the shop; I supposed it to be the doctor coming to the house, as there was a person ill. There was no appearance of marks on the door, it had only been latched. MARY SMITH . I live at Twickenham. Last Monday fortnight in the afternoon, the prisoner gave me the earrings; he lived at my mother's house three or four months. I put them in my ears - he did not say where he got them. Bannister claimed them; and I gave them to him. THOMAS WEBB . I am a constable. I went to the prisoner's mother's house, which is next door to Smith's; he boards at his mother's, and sleeps at Smith's.

On the night the prosecutor says he was robbed, I will take my oath he was in bed and fast asleep at the time - it was a fortnight ago last Saturday - he was not out all day; he was very ill indeed, and went to bed at ten o'clock. I got up between six and seven o'clock and left him in bed, and staid at home with him till ten or eleven o'clock, and then went to the water-side; I returned in half an hour, and was at home all the afternoon - we went to bed together between ten and eleven o'clock. I got up at six o'clock. I came home to breakfast, and never asked whether he was in bed or not. He had a violent pain in his inside. He went to the doctor for medicine on Saturday morning. I recollect it because it was the only day I was at home. I could not sleep sound, for he was so ill. MARY SMITH re-examined. The prisoner was at home all day on Saturday, very ill, and slept at home that night - he could not have gone out without passing my mother's door.Q. He might have crept down - A. My mother is of a very weak constitution, and sleeps very little at night. I saw the box in my mother's cupboard two or three days before Webb came. He gave me the ear-rings on Monday; I put them in my ears on Thursday; he saw them there, and did not object to it. Bannister lives about quarter of a mile off.Prisoner. I had a dog to sell, and sold it to William Tubs . I went to him on Monday, and picked these things up - I wore the ring on my finger three or four days, and offered it for sale.

I was going to Brentford with the prisoner; and in going through Isleworth, he went into Humphreys', and said he was going in there to pawn a pair of stockings, to get a pot of beer, and asked me to wait for him, which I did, about twenty yards from the door. I did not see him come out, but after he came out I saw him with a pair of white stockings in his hands; I cannot say whether he had any thing under them; he walked on about twenty yards, then told me to walk on and he would overtake me, which I did, and he overtook me in Zion-fields, where I met a friend, and there we separated. I overtook him again at Brentford Bridge. I saw no money with him. MARY WESTON . I live at Isleworth. I was going to Brentford market with a woman; the prisoner passed me; the woman said, that was one of the Twickenham swells; he turned round and spoke to her, and said he was going to a badger baiting.

I went into the public-house and found my husband was not there. As I came out, they still stood there, and just as I turned back, one of them ran after me - I looked back, and saw he had a blue coat on - he knocked me down - that was not the prisoner. When I was down, the prisoner ran up and took my shawl. I caught hold of him by the tail of his coat, and he handed the shawl to another man.

She said,""Well, I don't care, so as I get the value of my shawl - that is all I want, and shall not appear."" I took these prisoners to the Thames Police, and when she got there, she said she could not swear to either of them. The Magistrate committed them as vagrants, and as she came out, the mother of one of them said,""You d - d ***, see what a sovereign will do."" White then came to me and said,""I fear I have done wrong - I have taken a sovereign of Mrs. Agnue."" I said she had done very wrong. SARAH TRUEMAN . I heard Mrs. White say at the Thames Police that she did not wish to hurt any one, if her shawl was made good; Mr. Agnue, the father of one of the prisoners, said he would pay her; she valued it at 1 l., and I had it from her own lips afterwards, that she had received 1 l. from Mr. Agnue. She was very drunk that night, and on coming home said, if Mrs. Winston would pay her for her shawl, she would not swear to her son. I said she had already sworn to him - she said she was not obliged to appear. MARY ANN WHITE . It is quite wrong; no such thing happened. I never told Mr. Agnue I would not appear if I got the value of my shawl. I left Mrs. Agnue in the office. I never received a sovereign from Mr. or Mrs. Agnue, nor ever spoke to either of the witnesses. I saw Trueman at the office, and said, I did not wish to hurt any one, if my shawl was made good; Agnue's father said he would pay what I valued it at - he said to me,""Mrs. White, here is 1 l. for yourself,"" and threw it on the taproom table - I did not take it up.

He moved a little from the window, and I noticed the pane of glass broken, and some blood on the glass. I instantly collared him, and said,""You villain, you are breaking into this house.""

No; he said he was waiting for his sister, not for assistance. NICHOLAS MANNING . I am a watchman.

On hearing the cry, I went to Wild-street, and found the prisoner in custody of Howard, who was struggling with him. The shutter was down, and the bar broken, and a quantity of glass out. He was trying to get from Howard. He threw away two or three eggs - all of them broke except one, which I took to Marlborough-street, and it broke in my pocket.

WILLIAM MAYBARY . I am agent to Stephen Maberly of Paul's Wharf. The prisoner was a porter in the warehouse. We take stock every three months. On the 29th of September last we missed several pieces of linen and other things, amounting in value to 100 l. We took stock more minutely on the 5th of October, and found the goods still missing. On the 12th of October, I had some officers at the wharf, and determined to examine all the servants - the prisoner was the first that was called. Brand asked if he knew of any linen which had been taken - he said he did not, that he lodged at the corner of Knight Rider-court, on the first floor. We went to his lodging; he remained at the wharf - his wife was not at home, and we returned without searching. When we got back to the wharf, his wife came down almost directly, and we accompanied her back to the lodging, and on opening one of the drawers, Brand found forty or fifty duplicates, one of which led us to Mr. Chaffers's, of Queen-street; there were several remnants there of Mr. Maberly's sheeting, and one of diaper, which was a table cloth made up. There was only one article I could compare with what he had by us, that was a diaper table cloth. We had four pieces of that diaper in the warehouse, one of which had been cut on the 16th of May, 1820, six yards and a half, and sold to John Nelson . A piece measures forty yards. On taking stock we missed eight yards from one piece, and thirteen and a half from another; it was a very particular pattern and width. Mr. Maberly had manufactured it at Aberdeen, and only four pieces of it had been made. I found a remnant of dark sheeting in his drawers, of which we have the counterpart in the warehouse.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you went to the lodgings did you leave word who you were, and from where you came - A. I believe not. Brand spoke, we returned, and his wife came within five minutes to speak to him, saying she I understood some gentleman had been to the house. I think she opened the drawer where the duplicates were. I do not know whether it was locked. We have five people in our warehouse. I believe his wife said the duplicates belonged to a friend, who was out of town. It is thirty-four inches wide, which is a particular width. He has lived above thirteen years with us. DAVID NICHOLLS . I am warehouseman to Mr. Maberly. Brand brought a piece of linen sheeting to the warehouse. I compared it with a piece there, and it corresponded. We occasionally cut a piece for a friend. The piece was matched with what Brand had - it had never been cut by us. I did not know that it was cut before this; it had been in the warehouse more than a year. It was not cut strait, and the piece matched exactly. The whole piece should be eight yards and a half; Brand produced about four. The qualityis the same - the edge corresponds. He brought it after the prisoner was committed.Cross-examined. Q. You did not see it for a week after he was apprehended - A. Less than that; I think it might be five days. I have brought the piece it was cut from. This piece was one hundred and twenty-six yards when it came from the manufactory. It makes eight and a half. I had not seen the remnant within a year before. WILLIAM BRAND . I am a marshalsman. I went to the prisoner's lodging, and found his wife there. The second time I went I found the piece of sheeting in one of the drawers. I took it to the warehouse some days after, and produced it in the same state as when I found it. I found a duplicate, which led me to Mr. Chaffers's; I got a piece of diaper from there. I saw the sheeting compared with a piece in the warehouse - it formed part of the same in my judgment. I have both here.Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner was left in the counting-house while you went to his lodging - A. Yes. I only asked if anybody was at home. I was dressed in my common clothes. I found the duplicate and sheeting in the same drawer. It was not locked. JAMES YOUNG . I am servant to Mr. Chaffers. The diaper table cloth was pawned with us on the 16th of February last, by a woman, in the name of Ann Watson . The duplicate produced is the one I gave her.Cross-examined. Q. Have you not seen many table cloths of the same pattern and fabric - A. Many. There is nothing particular in this. I could not swear to it if it was stolen from me.Prisoner's Defence.

They used improper language: I was neither drunk nor sober, but capable of knowing what passed. ROBERT ROSS . I am a linen draper, and live in High-Holborn. I was coming through Great Turnstile, and saw the prosecutor and the two prisoners on the opposite side of Holborn, and from the conduct of the prisoners, I was induced to follow them. I saw Mr. Jay leave them near Brownlow-street - they followed him very closely - I saw him call a coach. He was then on the pavement; the coach drew up to the pavement - he was off the curb stone. As he got in, the prisoners went one on each side of him. Johnston took something from under his coat - she then said to Brown,""Come along."" I saw her put whatever it was under her pelisse. I went up and laid hold of her. She put her fingers up to her mouth, and said,""Hush."" I called the watch - she threw the pocket book from her, and was taken. Brown ran off, but was stopped by the watchman.Cross-examined. Q. Was not Brown some distance off - A. No, she was at Mr. Jay's side. SIRAS JAY . I am not related to the prosecutor. I saw Johnson throw the pocket book down in the middle of the street - I picked it up and gave it to the watchman.(Property produced and sworn to.)JOHNSTON'S Defence. I met this young woman - we went into the public-house for a glass of porter; the prosecutor sat in a box; there were five or six girls and men; he said he thought there was something superior in my appearance and behaviour, and he would give me whatever I liked to drink. I had brandy and water, and two glasses of gin, which he paid for, and we went away together, and by his desire I left him by Chancery-lane. We were going the same way as him; my attention was called by seeing several people round a coach - I went up and saw the pocket book; I picked it up; the gentleman came, and I said, if it belonged to him, to take it.BROWN'S Defence.

t18221023-36,violentTheft,highwayRobbery,death,none,18221023,"WILLIAM TOWNSEND alias POCOCK was indicted for feloniously assaulting Aaron Crossley Seymour , on the King's highway, on the 13th of September, at St. Marylebone, and putting him in fear, and taking from his person, and against his will, two sovereigns and one ten-pound bank-note his property.MR. WALFORD conducted the prosecution.MR. AARON CROSSLEY SEYMOUR. I live at Dublin, and am not in any business. In September last, I was in England, and lodged in Upper Bryanston-street; I am married. Mrs. Seymour was in England with me; on the evening of the 6th of September, we had drank tea with a friend in Lower Bryanston-street, which lies between Portman-square and Oxford-road, and is, I should think, not fifty yards from Oxford-road; I set out from there to go to see a friend next door to the Middlesex Hospital; I meant to take a coach. I met the prisoner at the corner of Bryanston-street, in Portman-street.Q. Did you meet, or did he overtake you - A. We came to the corner together - he asked what o'clock it was - it was quite dark, and was between eight and nine o'clock; I told him the time as near as I could, without taking out my watch; he remarked that it was a fine night, and walked by me; no further conversation passed; he continued to walk by my side, and when I got into Oxford-street, I stood on the pavement searching for my eye glass, to see if there was a coachman on a coach-box, and while searching for my glass he asked if I wanted a coach - I said I did - he then said he believed I was a stranger in London, and he would get one for me.Q. Were you a stranger in town - A. Yes; I had only been here two days - I was here some years ago.Q. A good many years ago - A. Yes; he asked what direction I was going in - I said towards Middlesex Hospital; he said he was going in the same direction, and begged I would allow him to take part of the coach, and he would pay his share; I said I would pay for the coach, and if any accommodation to him, he was at liberty to go as far as convenient - I thought it would be ungenerous to refuse just at that moment. He pointed out a coach on the stand, which happened to be the first - we walked towards it, and before we said any thing, the door was opened; I cannot tell who by, but it was not the waterman usually on the stand; I stepped in first - the prisoner delayed in coming in, and said something to the man who opened the door, which I did not hear, and immediately stepped into the coach, which was shut up in a moment - the door was shut so very quick, I had not a moment to direct where to drive, and the man did not apply, as they usually do, for money. The prisoner placed himself between me and the door, and immediately gave the direction towards Marylebone Church; not knowing immediately where Marylebone Church was, I said,""Is that in my direction?"" - he said it was; the coach drove up Portman-street, which I had come down, into Portman-square; if it had turned to the right in the square, it would take me to Middlesex hospital - I knew that from the map - but I saw it go up to the west side of the square, and immediately objected, and said it was taking me out of my way; he said it was not - at this time the coach was going on rapidly; he said he only wanted to go to the street a little above the square, and then the coach would go on with me; I said I was in a hurry to go to Berner's-street, and he must either leave the coach, or I would, and get another; he said there was no necessity for my leaving the coach, as he meant to drive to Marylebone New Church, and then to the watch-house; I asked what business he could have at the watch-house; he said he meant to commit me for malepractices; I immediately put my head out of the window and called to the coachman to stop - and then saw a man on the box with the coachman; the prisoner begged I would not make a noise, as we could get out quietly at Marylebone Church; I was alarmed at what he had said, and having seen two men on the coach box, I said I would not stay another moment - I again called the coachman; he did not hear me, I suppose; the prisoner put his head out on the other side, and said something, what I could not hear - he spoke to one of the men on the box - the coach was at this time just passing the garden of Montague House, I opened the door and jumped out, being much alarmed, and ran down the west side of the square, and saw no more of him that night; I turned to the south side of the square, and along Edward-street, to Middlesex hospital. And on the 12th or 13th, (I don't know the day of the week), I saw him again about four o'clock, in the afternoon, at my own door in Upper Bryanston-street, just as I was knocking; he said he had now found out where I lived - expressed himself dissatisfied at my having treated him so shabbily about the coach; I told him my leaving the coach was unavoidable, as I expected either to be robbed or murdered - that he had imposed on me as I was a stranger; the door was at that moment opened by my servant - I said I would be in, in a few minutes; I was unwilling to bring him into the house, and we walked up to the top of Bryanston-street. He told me he was a hard-working man, and that I was a gentleman - and said,""Now, you shall pay me well, or I will expose you to the world;"" I asked him how - he said he knew himself, and that he was an ironmonger living in Adam-street, (there is Adam-street close by Edgware-road) - that his name was William Townsend , and he was well known in the neighbourhood; I remonstrated with him on the impropriety of his accusation and demand.Q. What demand had he made - A. He had said he would be paid well or he would expose me - he said he must have 50 l., or he would expose me to the world. I reasoned with him - and told him he could neither have principle, honour, nor humanity, to extort money from me, and he must be conscious that he was extorting it; he said he did not want to talk about things of that sort, he must have the money - he became very loud in his demands, and threatened to expose me to the first person he met in the street.Q. Did he ever say what he would expose you about - A. Nothing more than malepractices; he was loud in his demands - I became very much alarmed and thrown offmy guard - I said I had not such a sum of money, and could not afford to give it him; he said he would take 20 l.; I said I could not give him that neither; he said he must have it; I replied I could not give it - he then asked what I could give him; I said I had 10 l. in my pocket; he swore with an oath, he would not take that; I do not recollect what the oath was; he said immediately after that he would take that, if I would give him something more, but he would not take 10 l. alone as he had sworn it; I said I could get him a couple of sovereigns perhaps, and begged him to wait in the street. I returned home, went up stairs, dinner was on the table - I told Mrs. Seymour I should be back in a minute; I got two sovereigns out of my desk, went down and gave them to him - (I had given him the 10 l. note.) He went away, swearing in a very solemn manner, that I should never hear of him, or see him any more.Q. About how long were you in the coach with him on the 6th of September - A. I think not five minutes, we did not go more than four hundred yards; I certainly did not take any indecent liberties with him - nor was I guilty of any malepractices towards him. I parted with my money from very great alarm and apprehension of his exposing both my person to danger, and my character to injury.Cross-examined by ADOLPHUS. Q. You were in town only two or three days before this happened - A. I came to town on Wednesday, and this happened on Friday - it is nearly four years since I was in town before.Q. Had you not been in London at all during that interval of four years - A. For two days I had - that was about a month before this transaction - I then came from Cheltenham. I only came to see my brother who was in a bad state of health; I lived in Dublin.Q. Have you lived much in England, during the four years, though not in London - A. I have, at Brighton, Bath, Cheltenham, and Tunbridge - I lived at those places for the first two years of the four - but for the last two years I have been out of England, except the times I have mentioned.Q. How long were you living in London four years ago - A. I was about eight months in the neighbourhood of Bedford-square - I lived in China Mews, Tottenham Court-road. I was never in any business; I knew very well how to call a coach for myself - but was not at all acquainted with the streets in the neighbourhood of Marylebone; I was once in Regent's-park, four years ago. The person I wanted to call on by the Middlesex Hospital, was Mrs. Ward, No. 39, Berner's-street. I had no acquaintance with the prisoner till he spoke to me. Oxford-road was not my nearest way - but I went there for the purpose of getting a coach. I did not take the number - and did not see a creature passing to call to for assistance; there might be people passing, but I did not see them. I mentioned this circumstance to nobody between the 6th and 12th. Montague House is at the North West corner of Portman-square - I had never been by there before, but have walked there since.Q. On the 12th or 13th, did he say any thing more than that he would expose you - A. For malepractices, he said nothing more. There was not a man-servant in the house. I did not attempt to secure him, or desire help.MR. WALFORD. Q. Was the coach stand the nearest to Lower Bryanston-street - A. Yes.COURT. Q. Did you ever go to Adam-street to look for an ironmonger named Townsend - A. Never.Q. What was your reason for not calling for assistance on the 13th in the street, it being day-light - A. I felt very much alarmed, and saw a man pass by in Bryanston-street, while I was talking to the prisoner, and the prisoner nodded very familiarly to him, and laughed - and he passed twice again while we were talking. When we were in Bryanston-street, he said his mother had left him an estate in Ireland, which he expected to get when he was of age - that it amounted to 3,000 l., and he wished to go over to get payment of it, and had not the means, and threw himself on me to enable him so to do - and after that he threatened if I did not give him the money he would expose me. I have been married nearly five years.Q. How soon after the 12th or 13th, did you communicate to any one about what passed - A. I cannot exactly say - my wife spoke to me about it about the 2d of October.JURY. Q. How was the prisoner dressed, when you took him into the coach - A. Entirely in black, but being night I could not distinguish whether it was good black - he appeared to me well dressed. I am sure it was on Friday, and not on Sunday night. MARY KENDALL . I keep the house, No. 28, Upper Bryanston-street. On the 5th of September last, Mr. and Mrs. Seymour came to lodge with me. The prisoner came to the house several times - the first time was the 2d of October, about eight o'clock in the morning; I let him in; nobody was with him; he requested to see Mr. Seymour; I said he was not at home - he said he had better not deny himself, for he had been twice denied before, and if Mr. Seymour would not see him, he would fetch an officer; he went away for about five minutes, and brought a young fellow with him, and said that was an officer, and that he was one himself; the young man said nothing; I requested them to come in and speak to Mrs. Seymour - (Mr. Seymour was out); he was very turbulent, and I requested Mrs. Seymour to come down to see him. He said he wanted 28 l. from Mr. Seymour, that he had received 12 l. at one time, and 10 l. at another. Mrs. Seymour came down - I was present, and shewed her into the front parlour; I stood in the passage; the prisoner took out a short stick, and said he was an officer - (the other man did not come in at all.) I could hear what passed, as the door was open; he said his business was secret; he could not tell Mrs. Seymour what it was on any account, and said he would be there at 12 o'clock next day; this was on Thursday, the 2d of October; I believe it was 11 o'clock before he left. Mrs. Seymour saw him twice after that in my presence. He was taken up in the passage of my house, on the Tuesday after; he had called several times in the course of that time. He told me on the Monday before he was taken, that he was a watchmaker, named Townsend, living in Adam-street, that he was a very respectable young man, and very well known; he came several times. On the Saturday I saw him, and spoke to him - he said he understood Mr. Seymour was a man of fortune, and bore a very good character, and married a rich heiress, and he was surprised he could not pay him the money he had promised him; he said he would inform Mrs. Seymour if he did not pay him - and desired to speak to her; I called her down - she came to the door, and desired to know what he wanted; he said he could not inform her, itwould make her miserable for life, and blast Mr. Seymour's character - he said nothing more, but went away. On the Monday after, I met him in Oxford-street, between eight and nine o'clock at night - he spoke to me; I said I could not stop to speak to him in the street; he said he wished me to inform Mr. Seymour he should call on him in the morning; I desired him not to call to annoy Mrs. Seymour any more, for it was very unpleasant to me and her; he said he was in great want of his money; he was going to Ireland; that his grandmother was dead, and he could not go without the money - that Mr. Seymour was guilty of crimes not worthy of a man; I asked how he became acquainted him - if it occurred in Ireland or since he came to England; he said in England; I asked how he knew it; he said he called a coach in Oxford-street; I asked if Mr. Seymour had insulted the coachman; he said No; he called a coach, and took a person in it with him.Q. He said a person, not himself - A. No, a person; nothing more passed till next morning at eight o'clock, when he knocked at the door; I saw him in a minute, and showed him into the front parlour, requesting he would not see Mrs. Seymour any more, as it would be very serious and he would be taken up.Cross-examined. Q. They came to you on the 5th - A. Yes; from the Park-hotel, where they had been only one night; they came from Cheltenham; they went to drink tea every evening at a relation's in Lower Bryanston-street; I think the lady's name is Rogers.Q. He said his business was money, and it was a secret affair - A. Yes; he did not object to my being present. Mrs. Seymour requested me to go in.Q. You told him he would be taken up if he came, and yet he did come - A. Yes.MRS. ANN SEYMOUR . I am the prosecutor's wife. On Wednesday, the 2d of October, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, (I think), Mrs. Kendall called me down. I saw the prisoner; he said my husband owed him 50 l., I said it must be a mistake, he said it was not; I asked what it was for, he said it was a great secret; I said I knew nothing about it, but if it was the case, if he would call next day at twelve o'clock, if the money was owing, Mr. Seymour would settle it; he went away. I requested information might be given at the police-office; and about four o'clock that day, the officers came, but the prisoner did not come. I did not see him again till about seven o'clock on Saturday evening; I was in the parlour, and went out to him and asked his business, he said he wanted 28 l. of Mr. Seymour, and if he did not get it he would injure Mr. Seymour's character for ever; I replied, that his character did not depend on him; and he said he would ruin my happiness for ever by the disclosure, and that he would write me a letter by the next morning, stating the whole particulars; I received no letter. I did not see him again till the Tuesday morning following, which was the 8th of October; when he came, I went into the parlour and called Mrs. Kendall in and my own servant; the prisoner said,""Now Ma'am I will tell you all. Mr. Seymour is guilty of crimes unworthy of man; I have two coachmen to prove it; they say they will prosecute me, as I know where he lives, if I don't prosecute him, and I have given them 20 l. each, and I am a ruined man if I don't get 28 l."" I offered him 10 l. if he would sign a paper never to molest Mr. Seymour more, (Mr. Seymour came into the parlour while I was making the offer, I think,) he said he would not sign the paper as he should get himself into a scrape, and said he would not take the money except he had a witness of his own; Mr. Seymour offered him 10 l.; he said, at last, he would take the money of Mrs. Kendall at the hall-door. We had two officers ready looking out for him. Mrs. Kendall had the money ready to give him at the hall-door, when Clement's, the officer, came and took him. THOMAS CLEMENTS . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I apprehended the prisoner in the passage of No. 28, Bryanston-street, on Tuesday, the 8th of October. I had attended on Wednesday, the 2d of October, Thursday, the 3d, and Monday the 7th, for the purpose of taking him, by the prosecutor's desire. As I took him to the office, he began to speak to me of his own accord; he said,""Oh, he is a bad one."" I asked in what respect; he then said,""About five weeks ago, I was walking in Seymour-street, about half drunk; and the prosecutor came up to me, took hold of my arm, and asked if I would go and have something to drink; I refused, saying I had been drinking before"" - that they walked together until they came to a coach-stand in Oxford-street, when the prosecutor called a coach, and they got in and drove up Portman-street, across Portman-square, and when they got into Gloster-street, the gentleman put one hand across his neck, and the other into his breeches - that he directly called to the coachman to stop, with intent to take the man who was on the box with the coachman, inside, and then drive to Marylebone watch-house; but before the coachman could stop, he jumped out and ran away; that he never saw him after for a fortnight, and then he was drinking at Buckland's public-house, Bryanston-street, and saw the prosecutor go up to the next door; that he ran up to him, and collared him, and said,""Now I have found you, I'll go and fetch my father, and you shall be exposed for what you did to me in the coach the other night, and left me to pay for the coach"" - that the prosecutor begged of him to be quiet, and he would give him anything to be quiet, and say no more about it; that he then went in, and brought out a 10 l. note and two sovereigns, and gave him - that he at first refused to take it, and threw it down on the stones, but afterwards took it and went away.Cross-examined. Q. Did he repeat the same before the Justice - A. Part of it. I believe it was not written down. One Kelly was sent for, who made a demand on the prisoner. I believe it was not taken down. I was present all the time.COURT. Q. You searched the prisoner's apartments - A. Yes. He told me he lived in Cutler-street, Oxford-road - I went and searched his lodgings there, and found a pocket book in a chest of drawers, containing a quantity of pawnbroker's duplicates. Some things which I found were afterwards delivered up to him.MR. WALFORD. Q. How much did Kelly demand of the prisoner - A. I cannot say whether it was 3 l. 10 s. or 4 l. The prisoner said,""I do not owe you a halfpenny,"" and repeated it several times - Kelly persisted in it, and it drew tears from the prisoner, and at last the prisoner said,""You want to extort money from me, the same as I have from this gentleman,"" pointing to the prosecutor.Cross-examined. Q. He directed you to his lodgings; how long he lived there you do not say - A. Only from what I heard. I am sure he did not say, you want to extort money, the same as I am charged. I rather think he told me he had lived in Adam-street, but am not certain. He did not say what he was.Prisoner's Defence. I have to say that when I accosted Mr. Seymour in the street, he pushed his hands away from him, and said,""For God's sake don't expose me. I will give you any sum you want."" He walked across into Paddington-fields, where it is private. I told him I did not want money, for if my father knew it he would sacrifice me and him too. He insisted on my having money, and said that money was more object to me than my character - I took it up, and went away with it. Besides that, he says it was on Friday night when he first met me - it was half-past ten o'clock on Sunday evening. He accosted me, and asked me what it was o'clock - (I had a watch which Clements has.) He walked with me to the corner of Adam-street. I did not know he was going to state it was Friday, or I could have brought a man who saw him speak to me on Sunday night, at half-past ten o'clock. THOMAS CLEMENTS . I have a watch of his.MR. SEYMOUR. Q. You walked to the top of the street with him, were you in any field with him - A. Certainly not. I was not out of Bryanston-street - he had not threatened me with anything about his father. GUILTY - DEATH . Aged 19.Second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice Park.",guilty,none

I saw the prisoner in the crowd; he struck a boy named Blake, on the left breast, with his right hand; I saw nothing in his hand when he hit Blake; it was a front blow. I heard a cry that he had stabbed him; the prisoner ran off; I overtook him about one hundred yards off, and took hold of his right hand, in which I found a pen-knife, I put it into my pocket without noticing whether it was bloody. I said,""You rascal what has become of the knife?"" he opened his hand and gave it to me. I told him he had stabbed a boy; he made no answer. I took him back to the place, and found he had stabbed two boys. A surgeon was sent for, who said Blake's wound was dangerous; the prisoner was detained; he said he would never carry a knife again, and then he could not use it; that the boys had beset him, and he had said he would strike them with it if they did not leave him alone; that they had been following him, and beating him.

In consequence of what she said, I went in pursuit, and about a quarter before twelve o'clock, Pate and I were together, and the prisoner was coming down Winfield-street; I stopped him and asked what he had done with the shawl he took from the woman, (she had not described him - I took him from seeing him go by about the time;) he said""What woman?"" I said the woman who was knocked down and had the shawl taken from her in George's-street; he strongly denied it. I took him with the assistance of my partner, to her house; he still denied it. Pate took off his hat and the shawl was in it. I saw nobody else in the street when he went down. WILLIAM PATE . I have heard the last witnesses's account, it is true; I found the shawl in the prisoner's hat; he had denied it. THOMAS HART . The prisoner was brought to the watch-house with the shawl about twelve o'clock at night.(Property produced and sworn to.)Prisoner's Defence. I was going towards home, and at the corner of the street I picked up this shawl; I asked several people if it belonged to them; nobody owned it. I put it in my hat, and had it for half an hour.

ALLEY and ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution.MR. HALL LYNN. I am a partner in the firm of George Hale and Co., brewers; there are three partners - George Hale is the first. Lacey and Walters were in our service, and in consequence of information, I got the officers to watch them; they are our draymen; they have their orders every morning from the storehouse clerk, and all the casks are put into the dray, and they have to bring back the empty ones from the customers, whatever they return. We have lost casks within the last year to the amount of 1200 l.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many servants have you - A. A great many. We have bought upwards of 300 new casks within the last year. I have ten draymen.Q. Is it not the practice, when they are overloaded, to leave casks at any place, and call for them in the morning - A. I never knew ale casks deposited in that way; I have known small casks pitched. If the dray is full, they should leave them in the publican's cellar.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever know men go out of their way to leave casks - A. Never. A dray will carry twenty-four full barrels, and perhaps thirty empty. I never knew casks pitched in the City. JOHN CLINTON . I am an officer. I was employed to watch the prisoners. On Saturday, the 28th of September, about seven or eight o'clock in the morning, the firstthing I observed was the dray coming from the brow-house in Redcross-street - Lacey and Walters attended it. They first stopped at the Bull's Head, public-house, Jewin-crescent, and delivered two casks, and received two empty ones in return, and put them in the dray. They then went and delivered two casks at the Nagg's Head, Aldersgate-street, and received one empty one. They then went to the corner of Butcherhall-lane, and delivered four full casks, and received five empty; then to Bowman's, in St. Paul's church-yard, left two casks, and received four empty ones; then to the Weaver's Arms, London Wall, and left five full, and received five empty ones; then to the Flying Horse in Grub-street, and livered one, and received one. This house is about two hundred yards from the brew-house; and if they wanted to dispose of the empty casks, they could go and deliver them; but they turned back, and went down to the bottom of Fore-street, towards Moorfields - and there Walters left his companion, and went across Moorfields, and Lacey went towards London Wall, into Bishopsgate-street, and stood opposite Bishopsgate Church. In about five minutes Walters returned, and came up to the dray, and they went with the dray to the London workhouse - they stopped there and took out four large empty casks, and rolled them on the heads, (each having two), into the yard of the London workhouse. Turner was the porter at the gate - he received the casks from them, and put them up by the side of the wall, inside the gates - and as he received them one at the time, he took hold of some hamper leads and baskets, and covered them over one at a time, so as to conceal them; and the moment the fourth was delivered, Lacey turned his horses' heads round, and drove off at a very fair pace. Walters and Turner stopped a minute or two, and tossed up a halfpenny, and as soon as he picked up his halfpenny, both came out of the workhouse gate. I went in, and went to the casks, lifted up the covering, and saw""Hale, Redcross-street,"" very deeply burnt on the cask; and instead of finding four casks, I found five; only four were delivered at that time. They were all five marked the same. I then took the opportunity of taking a knife out, and marking them. I continued to watch them day and night, till Monday night, to see how they were disposed of. I left on Wednesday - they were on the premises then; I went again on Friday, in the afternoon, and missed them; but before that, between the Saturday and Friday, I had seen the prisoners there in conversation with Turner twice; they both went together both times. I apprehended Turner at the workhouse gate, on the Friday; the casks were then gone. Turner came in at the gate about two o'clock. I asked him what had become of the casks left by Hale's draymen, the other day; he said,""Go and ask those who took them away."" I said I was an officer, and would not be trifled with - I repeated my question, to which he returned the same answer. He was very resolute; I handcuffed him, and brought him to the Compter. I had taken the other prisoners at the brewhouse before. They laughed at it.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. It was done in open day light - A. Yes; the dray left as soon as they were delivered. I made a memorandum of the circumstance - they received eighteen empty casks in all, and delivered sixteen full ones.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Would the dray have held more casks - A. Yes, it was a large four-wheeled dray, with three horses. WILLIAM SHEPPARD . I am an officer - and accompanied Clinton. Every word of his evidence is true. I was not with him when the prisoners were apprehended. I saw the casks in the workhouse yard, covered with hampers; Turner covered them over. I watched them from Saturday till Monday.Cross-examined. Q. How many days did you see the casks in the yard - A. From Saturday till Monday. The names could not be seen, without the hamper covers being taken off.MR. LYNN. Our brewery has nothing to do with the London workhouse. The casks cost us 23 s. each.Cross-examined. Q. Is your storehouse clerk here - A. No, he only orders what beer to take out.WALTERS' Defence. A great deal he has sworn is false.TURNER'S Defence. These men have frequently come and said they were heavily loaded, and left casks, and fetched them sometimes the same day, and sometimes in a day or two. They left five on Saturday; I moved some baskets for them to go against the wall, and then threw them up, to make way for the trucks to come in. The master of the workhouse once gave them leave to put casks there. HENRY GARDNER . I have been master of the workhouse nineteen months - Turner was porter there. One day, about twelve months ago, the prisoners came to me when I was in the yard, and asked permission to leave some casks - I gave them leave. I have observed none there since.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had not been there long, when the request was made - A. No, they did not ask my leave, till they saw me coming. The workhouse cellars are hired by a wine merchant - and casks are being brought there all day. There are baskets and hampers about.LACEY - GUILTY . WALTERS - GUILTY .See sixth day.TURNER - GUILTY .

ATTORNEY GENERAL and MESSRS. BOLLAND and WALFORD conducted the prosecution. JOHN JONES . I am a silversmith, and live at No. 338, in the Strand. I have lived there nine years. The prisoner is a working silversmith - I have known him as one for six or seven years. He worked for his father before he went into business for himself, and was well acquainted with the trade. In the beginning of the year 1821, I gave him a general order for goods, which he brought in at four different times. I produce the bill of parcels of the goods delivered by him; it is in his hand-writing.This bill was here read - it contained various items, among which were the four gravy spoons stated in the indictment. There was a charge of 4 l. 15 s. 1 d., for duty on the whole weight of the goods.He found the silver himself. His charge on the bill is merely the fashion, the weight of the silver is at the bottom, and the price not charged.Q. Do you understand from this he meant to state he had paid for duty 4 l. 15 s. 1 d. - A. Exactly so. I paid him that sum including the duty. He delivered the gravy spoons on the 2d of March - I produce them. When I ordered them of him I had no other gravy spoons in my stock, nor have I had any since. I am sure they are the same he delivered me on the 2d of March. I afterwards delivered them to Mr. Miles, the inspector of stamps. This was a fortnight or three week ago. I marked them first.Q. Have you any other article now in your possession included in the bill of parcels, besides the gravy spoons - A. Yes; here is a soup ladle. I bought two. Sometime after I received them, he came to me, and wanted to borrow one for an order he had in a hurry, and I lent him one - about a week afterwards he returned it; I cannot say it is the same I lent, but both came from him. The weight was cast up, and I paid him part in cash and part in a bill at two months - the total sum of the whole order, which was in four deliveries, was 41 l. 8 s. 1 d., the amount of fashion, and duty is 8 l. 10 s. of the first bill. The amount of the whole silver was 73 l. 18 s. 7 d. I had a transaction with him in February, and have a bill of parcels of it. It contains six French dessert spoons - I paid him for duty on the whole delivery 3 l. - it was included in the total amount. I produce the six dessert spoons; the other things are sold. At the time I had these dessert spoons from him, I had no others of that description in my stock, nor have I had since.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have been speaking of transactions eighteen months ago - A. Yes, my business is not very large - I only employ one working silversmith, besides him. I dealt with his father, their business is not very large, I believe. I believe the prisoner delivered me the goods himself - part of them I can speak positively to. I never entered the goods I bought of him in any book, because I always paid him money when he brought them in. I am perfectly certain that these goods came from his hand. He has a brother or two, and his father used to come sometimes. I might have received some goods from his apprentice; workmen and apprentices have brought goods in some cases. These goods have been in my possession ever since; I am sure he brought them himself. I have one young man who has the care of my stock, he has been with me three years - he and my wife are the only persons having access to my stock; the shop is locked up at night. We weigh them, and put a private mark on them, but no mark to distinguish from whom they come; I trust to the maker's initials, which are punched on the stamp. Until within the last three weeks, I had no reason to direct my attention tothem. I have no other goods of the kind in my possession. I never lend plate out. I have not dismissed any servant since March, 1821. I believe the bill of parcels is in the prisoner's hand-writing - the back of it is, but I cannot speak to the body of it, because I did not see him write it.COURT. Q. Judging of his hand-writing, do you believe it to be his; suppose you saw a Bill of exchange drawn in that hand, as by him, should you have accepted it - A. Yes, I should.MR. BOLLAND. Q. Is the back of the bill, which is the particulars of the whole transaction, his writing - A. It is, I saw him write it, and gave him the money; my private mark is on the spoons to denote the weight - I put that on perhaps a day or two after; they are the identical spoons.COURT. Q. You said you had one other person employed to manufacture for you, what are his initials - A. I have some from Wintle, I don't know his Christian name.Q. You said you never entered the prisoner's work, because you paid him money, now one of the bills of parcels amounts to 8 l. 10 s. 1 d. which relates to various articles, and on the back of it is different duty and amounts, you did not pay that till the 2d of March - A. I added the bills altogether, knowing he would bring them in, in a few days. DAVID JONES . I am a silversmith - and live in Broad-street, St. Giles's. I have had dealings with the prisoner; about the latter end of November, or beginning of December, 1820, I ordered some tea-spoons of him, which he supplied me with. I produce his bill of parcels - (read, dated, the 16th of December, 1820, amount 1 l. 12 s. 7 d.) - The spoons were delivered on the 9th of December. I produce them - 12 s. 6 d. is charged in the bill, as the duty on 80 z. 7 dwts. - I paid him the account on the 16th of December - when he brought me the bill, dated the 16th, which was for other articles, among which is one tea-spoon to match some others - 9 d. was charged for duty on that spoon; I paid that - but I have not got the spoon now. I paid him for the whole of the two jobs on that day, (the 16th of December, 1820.) I paid him cash, 1 l. 12 s. 7 d. for manufacture and duty; I gave him silver for the weight. I produce the 12 spoons which I received on the 9th, and am sure they are the same.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This occurrence was two years ago - A. About that time. I cannot say whether he delivered them, or whether it was his father, or brother; his brother was a workman, but the father had given the business up to the prisoner - but resided with him, and assisted him a little. The apprentice might have delivered them; but I received them from the prisoner's house. I have an apprentice. I think I received the goods myself, because I gave back work - but am not certain. I had two apprentices at that time; they are both with me still. I may have lent plate to accommodate a friend - but never lent tea-spoons on any occasion in my life. The bills and pattern of the spoons, enables me to speak to the circumstance - but I have a recollection of the circumstance. I am obliged to keep the pattern, but it is not often enquired for. I dare say every shop has that pattern. I have not turned any apprentice away. I have one whom I have a suspicion about - but that does not relate to duty, it is quite unconnected with it.MR. WALFORD. Q. Are those the spoons described in that bill - A. They are; I am certain of it; they have my private mark on them, which corresponds with the weight in the invoice - which enables me to say they are the same described in the bill. The prisoner himself received the money, the duty being part of it. He put his initials to the bill at the time I paid him.JURY. Q. Of course the duty charged in the bill, refers to the goods in those bills - A. It does; the duty charged never relates to goods not charged in the particular invoice. JOHN WHITE DENNINC . I am journeyman to Mr. William Kirkham , a pawnbroker, who lives in Blackfriar's-road. I produce from our house, two silver skewers, which I had delivered to Mr. Miles; they formed a part of Mr. Kirkham's sale stock. WILLIAM KIRKHAM . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Blackfriar's-road. I sometimes buy goods. I succeeded Joseph Phillips , of Burdett-place, Kent-road; at this house, I bought the whole of his stock of him - among which were three skewers; one we sold, and the other two were taken away on Saturday, by Mr. Miles; the last witness delivered them to him.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS, JUNIOR. Q. From whom did you receive them - A. I found them in the house. I took the stock in February last. JOSEPH PHILLIPS . I carried on business as pawnbroker, in Blackfriar's-road. Mr. Kirkham succeeded me, and took all the stock; the prisoner worked for me as silversmith, from about May, 1819, until September, 1821. He made three skewers for me, which I parted with to Mr. Kirkham - (looking at two) - my firm belief is they are the same that the prisoner made for me; but I cannot positively say, they have been so long out of my possession. I have no private mark on them; I believe them to be the same, from the make and shape; he never made me any before; his initials are on the stamp; I noticed that, when he brought them to my house.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long ago is it, that he made them - A.(Looking at a memorandum), January the 18th, 1821; they were in my possession till the 11th of February, 1822; I have not seen them since; my full belief is, that they are the same.Q. Look at that skewer, there is no initial on that - A. I remember once remarking to the prisoner, that the initial was not quite legible - and he said it was owing to the stamping.Q. Have you had plate manufactured, or that came through the hands of Wintle - A. Not for many years - I think I had none within the last two years. I have had some from Weston, but not from him, for the last three years. I think there might be some of Wintle's make in my stock, when Mr. Kirkham took it. I do not know what has become of him or Weston.MR. BOLLAND. Q. Had you any skewers from Wintle or Weston - A. None from any body but the prisoner. When I asked him about the faint mark - he said it was owing to the stamping; he did not say they were not his mark. JAMES GEORGE STEVENS . I am a silversmith and pawnbroker, and live in Shoreditch. I dealt with the prisoner. Early in December, 1820, I ordered some butter ladles of him; he brought them home on the 8th or 9th, with a bill of parcels, which I produce - (read, charging the butterladles and several other articles, weight in all 12 oz. 2 dwts., duty 18 s. 2 d.) - the duty is charged 18 s. 2 d., which I paid him in the general account. I have two of the butter ladles - and produce them; the other pair is sold. I am sure they are the same; I never had any other of this description.COURT. Q. Suppose I put these into your hands, not knowing whom it came from, should you say the initials were H. D. - A. To the best of my knowledge I should.MR. WALFORD. Q. At the time the butter ladles were brought, was any fish slice brought - A. Yes; the prisoner brought them himself. I have the fish slice also. I bought it of him - and produce it - it is charged at the back of the bill; the charge includes the duty.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there a running account between you - A. Yes; the duty on different articles is specified in the bills. A variety of persons come to my shop; I have an apprentice and a young man; I am absent occasionally. I have a young boy in my service; I cannot say whether the shop was ever left to him; he is sixteen or seventeen years of age. I never pledged any of my stock; the goods were never out of my shop since I received them.Q. Did you ever state that you received four salt spoons from the prisoner, and afterwards found you were mistaken - A. No; I swear that positively.Q. Did you ever, on any occasion, within these two years back, make an offer to the prisoner that he should have back any goods he had left in your shop, if he had a doubt as to their correctness - A. No. GEORGE MILES . I am an inspector of silver plate stamps, and have been so about thirteen years. The prisoner has been for some years a working silversmith. The plate is brought to Goldsmith's Hall, with the initials of the maker impressed on it; it is then assayed to try the quality of silver, and if correct, the Goldsmith's mark is impressed on it; also the mark denoting that the duty is paid. The Goldsmith's marks are to certify it is correct in quality, that is the lion and the leopard's head; and the King's mark is the King's head. I have the punch here; there is a letter impressed, which varies on the 29th of May every year; wrought plate is never delivered from the hall until the initials of the manufacturer's are stamped - (looking at the skewers) - I should not have stamped plate marked as these are. On the 26th of September, I was present when the prisoner's premises were searched; I found a steel punch on his premises, with his initials, which I have here - it is the regular punch which he should have as a working silversmith. The initials are H. D. (Looking at two gravy spoons the subject of this indictment,) we should not have suffered these to pass with the initials in the state these are now in. I have seen them before. The stamp of the King's head is forged on each spoon - the lion and leopards' heads are also forged. I have compared the prisoner's punch with the marks on the spoons; the initials on them correspond with the punch; the letter D. corresponds. The punch could have punched that letter. It appears by the gravy spoons that the punch has been first applied one way, and then in the reverse direction, and is completely confused. I have made some impressions with his punch, which I produce. (Looking at twelve tea spoons sold to David Jones ,) These marks are forged on all of them, and there is the same imperfections in most of the initials. We should not have stamped them with such initials. (Looking at six dessert spoons sold to J. Jones,) They are forged in all respects, also the stamp on the soup ladle. The initials on this are struck double, and on the skewers; we should not have passed them. (Looking at the butter ladle and fish knife,) The stamps are forged on both, and the initials on both are struck double - this makes it more difficult to discover the real initials. The variable letter on all but the butter ladle is E, which letter came into use on the 28th of May, 1820, and ceased on the 27th of May, 1821. The letter on the butter ladle is D, which was in use the year before. We should not have struck that letter in 1820.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you any thing to do with stamping the plate - A. At times I do, but very seldom; I have not ceased to be a stamper. There are ten persons in the office, only four of them are stampers. I never heard of a stamper being dismissed for misconduct; nobody in the office has been discharged, or complained of for irregularities; mistakes have happened at times.Q. Genuine stamps have been mistaken for forged - A. Never in any instance that I ever heard of in my life.Q. Did you ever hear of an instance as it regarded Mr. Carteledge - A. Yes; that was no mistake, it is said to have taken place, but did not. After plate is stamped, it has to undergo a polishing; it is always sent in as forward a state as possible, that they should pay the less duty. The finishing does not make the stamp the less perfect than when it is done at the hall, if it is done with skill. I have seen marks as perfect as when it came out of the hall, and have seen some less perfect, but never so as to render it at all difficult to say whether the stamp is genuine or not.Q. Has there been presented to you pieces of plate, which at first, with common observation, you have hesitated about - A. I have hesitated certainly; if it is much obliterated I pause of course before I give my opinion. I know of no instance of a genuine mark being mistaken at our office for forged. I only know two manufacturers whose initials are H. D. We take an impression from the manufacturer's punch, and send it back to him; so that we see whether the punch mark corresponds with the impression we have; it comes to us with the manufacturer's mark punched on it; we do not enter in any book, who brings it; it is accompanied by two tickets, to denote from whom it comes; we take a receipt from the master or servant to whom it is delivered back.Q. A manufacturer may be imposed on by the bearer of the plate, by substituting other plate - A. Yes. Our office is confined to the London district; but if plate came from any part of the kingdom, we take it. How many there are in the kingdom whose initials are H. D. I cannot say.MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. Do you receive any plate from any person who has not a punch mark registered at your office - A. No; it is sent to the hall in as forward a state as possible, because the duty is according to weight, and polishing lessens the weight.Q. Have you ever seen any plate immediately after polishing, in which you could have any difficulty in knowing the mark - A. No, after it has been worn and got into use, it may become more obliterated; the letters on the other persons punch, whose initials are H. D. are a different size; this plate corresponds with the prisoner's punch mark, and not with the other. None of the plate produced, has been stamped at Goldsmith's Hall.COURT. Q. The plate comes to you unstamped - A. Yes, we send it out stamped.MR. JOHN SMITH . I am engraver to the Goldsmith's Company, and the Stamp Office. I engrave the punch mark - (looking at the four gravy spoons) - the King's head on these is forged - (looking at the whole of the articles produced) - the marks on all these are forged.Prisoner's Defence. I wish merely to state, most solemnly before my God, that I am innocent of the charge laid against me; if forgery is committed in any way, it is without my knowledge. CHARLES DAY . I am the prisoner's brother. I have worked with him about three years and a half.Q. Do you recollect, about the latter part of 1820, and some time after that, what state of health he was in - A. I recollect he was ill, and confined during that month.Q. What month - A. During the latter part of February.Q. What year are you speaking of - A.1820. I mean when it -Q. Attend - give a correct account; your brother was ill when - A. In December, 1821; he was exceedingly ill before that, and his life despaired of for four months before. I do not mean that he was ill for four months, but four months before, he was labouring under a stricture, and in December and January following he had a relapse. He was not able at times to go out. I transacted his business for him. He was ill about three weeks after that, and went to Herefordshire for his health, and staid there seven or eight days. His business was then done for him by other persons.- CARTELEDGE. I am a silver spoon maker. I had a transaction with the Goldsmith's Company when a mistake occurred - it was last August twelvemonth. Mr. Miles and two marshalsmen came to arrest me, and take me to the Mansion House, on the ground of stamped plate being forged; and when I got there, the mistake was found out. They had seized the plate as forged - it was given up - I have witnesses to prove it. It was not returned to me - it belonged to a box of Mr. Garfield's - it was not my property. I cannot say whether it was sent to its proper owner; I was not brought into trouble about it, but did all I could to bring the parties to justice.MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. Was the plate returned by the Company - A. I have never had it returned - it was detained because it was among others that were forged - it was not mine. I do not know whether my employer ever had it back.Q. The evidence against you was not sufficient, and you were discharged - A. Yes. I can swear, and prove that the mark was not forged. Garfield was not taken up with me - the plate was not in a box belonging to him - I know nothing about him. He was not in my business, nor was he at the Mansion House.MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was the plate marked with a genuine stamp - A. It was. WILLIAM MILES re-examined. I have an impression of the original stamp - the original is destroyed. There was no mistake in Carteledge's business. The plate was detained at the King's warehouse, as seized by his Majesty.Q. Was the King's head on it forged - A. It was.JURY. Q. Does the plate come to you sealed up - A. It does not - the initial punch is kept by the manufacturer, and he only can use it.Fifteen witnesses gave the prisoner a good character. GUILTY - DEATH .

WILLIAM JARRIN . I am a confectioner, and live in New Bond-street, in the parish of St. George's, Hanover-square. On Friday, the 27th of September, I saw the prisoner in my shop - he bought same cakes for two children he had with him. I knew him before, and went out, leaving him in the shop. I missed a gold watch, gold watch chain, and four rings, a small fish and key. I had seen them the night before on the table, in my bed-room, which is the second floor back room - the front room on that floor is where I make my confectionary ornaments. I did not miss the property till I heard the prisoner was in custody, which was the day after he came. He was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards, but was never in the bed-room. I allowed him a guinea a week on his father's account, as he was not on good terms with his father. The property is worth 8 l. I rent the house myself, and have no lodgers. He was in the habit of going to the workshop. JOHN FRANCIS . I am apprentice to Mr. Jarrin. The prisoner came to the shop on Friday; he remained there, and about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw him going up stairs; he did not say what he was going up for. He remained up stairs about half an hour. I said nothing to him, as he had been accustomed to go up to the workshop. There are other men up there. When he came down, he desired me to get him a hackney-coach, which I did, and he went away. JAMES HOWELL . I am shopman to Mr. Bartrum, of Prince's-street, Leicester-square.

I have seen some of them since at Marlborough-street.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. There was an excellent cream ewer lost with them - A. Yes, and a crest on it; it was beaten up when I found it. SAMUEL SUTTON . I saw Sir William Gordon 's plate safe in the servants' cupboard on Monday morning, the 15th of July. I am his footman. The articles stated in the indictment were among it; they were missed the next morning about ten o'clock.Cross-examined. Q. You never saw the prisoner in the house - A. Never. THOMAS CLEMENTS . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. In consequence of information, on Tuesday, the 23d of July, I went to the house of Guest, between one and two o'clock, and found him at home - it is a private house. I told him what I wanted; he unlocked a small trunk in the first floor back room, and produced a cream jug. He made no objection to my searching, but assisted me. The trunk was not concealed at all. In consequence of what he said, I called at Joseph's with a search warrant - I did not see him; he was afterwards summoned to attend the office, and came on the 24th, and was confronted with Guest. Guest was committed on the 24th, and discharged on the 27th, when the case was gone through and the prisoner was committed, I produced the cream jug - it was doubled up rather more than it is now.Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Did you produce your warrant - A. Yes. He knew I was an officer; I should have opened the box if he had not. He lives in Crown-court, Soho. The box was on the first floor; there was a bed there, but it was not under it. I searched the prisoner's house, and found nothing suspicious. He was a witness against Guest at first, and denied having sold them to him; he was afterwards bailed, and has surrendered to-day. JOSEPH GUEST . At the time of the robbery I lived in Crown-court, Little Pulteney-street. I have known the prisoner about a year and a half, he was a salesman and dealer in wearing apparel and plate, and lived in Chandos-street, Oxford-street; and keeps a shop. The officer searched my house; I gave him the cream jug; I bought it with the other property of the prisoner. He came to me on Monday, the 15th of July, between seven and a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening; I live up stairs; the street door is always open, but there is a centre door. My wife and daughter were present when he came. John Bouser worked for me at the time, he has absconded now; I have done all I could to find him out, but cannot. I was called down from my workshop, by my wife or daughter, to the prisoner, in the room on the first floor; he had a bundle with him, and said he had some second-hand plate that would suit me - he produced it - it consisted of a teapot, cream ewer, seventeen tea spoons, two egg spoons, a dessert spoon, two dessert forks, and one pair of sugar tongs, weighing together 44 oz. all but 2 dwts.; I considered I had no occasion to ask how he came by it. I agreed to give him 5 s. 6 d. per ounce, which amounted to 12 l. 1 s.; I gave him twelve sovereigns and one shilling; my wife was present when I paid him, but I am not positive whether my daughter was. I only had the milk pot when the officer came, having sold the rest; I had not sold the ewer because there was a crack in the handle, which I did not perceive previous to erasing the crest, and it was unfashionable; I could not mend it without, and being unsaleable I put it there to be melted.COURT. Q. Did you erase the crest - A. Yes; I beat it up in that shape. I erased it, to polish it up, to sell the better - and afterwards perceived the crack.Cross-examined by ALLEY. Q. He came to you, on the 15th of July, was that the day your house was searched - A. No.Q. Were not some of the spoons gilt, when you got them - A. No; it was towards the evening when I bought them - and I polished them that night. I saw no gilt on them. I did it between light and dark, and polishing might rub it off. I filed the crests off of course, as I do thousands in the year.Q. Was not your reason for breaking up the ewer, because the crest was so deep that in filing it out, you broke a hole in it - A. No; but beating it up to make it small for the pot, might make a hole.Q. If you did not intend it for sale, why file out the crest - A. I always file out crests and cyphers.Q. On your oath, did you say who you sold the spoons and other things to, till after the teapot was found - A. I had no occasion - I think the teapot was found on the Tuesday following. I gave 5 s. 6 d. an ounce for it - it was bruised, and all over dirt. I sold it all at 7 s. an ounce. I was in custody two days and a half. Bouser coloured the teapot up next morning; he has absconded. I was at Bow-street two years and a half ago, about some linen.MR. ANDREWS. Q. What was that - A. I was deceived by a young man, who was a shopman in New-street, Covent-garden. I was charged with buying linen of him; I was discharged.COURT. Q. The prisoner came to your house with them, between seven and eight o'clock - A. At half past seven - Bouser was up in the workshop with me; he saw Josephs on the first floor, as he came down stairs to leave work.Q. When you found the milk pot not worth selling, could you not as well have left it in the state it was - A. Iknocked it up to make it small for the melting pot. I did not knock it up for a week after.Q. When you shewed that milk pot to Clements, on your oath did you mention to him the teapot, spoons, or other things - A. Yes; and told him where I had sold them. ANN GUEST . I am the wife of Joseph Guest . On the 15th of July, my husband lived at No. 4, Crown-court. Mr. Joseph came that evening into the front room, on the first floor, which is the sitting room - he brought some plate. I called to one of my sons to tell my husband to come from the shop, which is at the top of the house. The prisoner was not many minutes in the room, till he came down - he opened the plate which he had in his bundle. I heard all that passed. He said he had brought forty-four ounces of plate, and my husband bought it for 5 s. 6 d. an ounce; it came to 12 l. 2 s.; 4 s. was taken off for the dirt on it - he gave Joseph twelve sovereigns and 1 s.; nobody else was in the room. My little girl was in the passage with the children - he went away, as soon as he got the money. Bouser, the workman, came down to leave work, while he was in the room, and saw him. I do not know what has become of him. The plate was taken up stairs into the shop the same night and finished off. I think my husband went to work again after the prisoner was gone. I heard him say he had sold the teapot to Jupp.Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. When did you first appear at Marlborough-street - A. On the Saturday. My husband had then been in custody four days. I called to my son Joseph to call his father down - he is not here. Bouser left work about seven o'clock. I do not know that I saw the things after Joseph brought them. JOSEPH GUEST re-examined. I cannot be positive whether there was a crest or cypher on the cream jug. I have so many crests to take out, I cannot say. SARAH GUEST . I am daughter of Joseph Guest . I remember the prisoner coming to my father's house in July, in a coach - he knocked at the passage door; I opened it; he asked if my father was at home, and went up to the first floor. He had a bundle tied in a blue silk handkerchief. I called my father down.Q. You called him with your own voice - A. Yes, and told him he was wanted. I went into the next room, and did not hear what passed. He told me to go and tell the coachman to stop, and he would be down in a few minutes, which I did. I saw him go out - he was quarter of an hour or twenty minutes in the house. Bouser left work soon after he came in - I cannot say whether he saw him.MR. ALLEY. Q. You, and not your brother called your father - A. No. My younger brother went up stairs. My brother did not call my father, it was me. JOHN FARQUHAR . The cream jug had a crest and two words written round it.MR. LAW. Q. It was in very good condition - A. Certainly. It was equally as good as the sugar bason, which I produce - it corresponded in pattern with it. Ten of the spoons were gilt inside, and seven plain - they had a motto strongly marked on them.COURT to GUEST. Q. Look at this sugar bason, and say on your oath had not the ewer and spoons the same crest and letters on them - A. It is possible they might, but I am so in the habit of erasing crests, I cannot say. I did not read the motto. I believe part of the spoons were gilt, but very much worn.MR. RICHARD THOMAS . I am a silversmith, and live in the Strand.

WILLIAM ROBSON . I live on St. Dunstan's-hill. Alfred Brooks is my partner; we rent the house between us. On Saturday night, the 11th of October, I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock; the house was properly secured; I was not disturbed in the night; I got up about eight o'clock in the morning; I went to a place of worship in the morning, and on returning Mrs. Robson said the house had been entered in the night. I examined the counting-house, the door of which opens into the private passage leading into Tower-street - I found the door leading from the warehouse into the counting-house open - it was closed overnight. I went to the iron safe which was in the warehouse, and where we kept our stamps; the the cash box used to be kept there about a month ago, when the prisoner lived with us as errand boy. I found the iron safe door open, but nothing gone. I went into the dining room, where the keys of the premises were kept, and the brass chain they were kept on was broken, and the keys of the iron safe and warehouse taken from it and returned again; there were no marks of violence about the warehouse. I suspect the entrance was made through the area which leads to the coal cellar, as the grating had been left unfastened. A person getting in there would get into the cellar, and then by lifting up a trap door could get into the passage. Two fowls and a quartern loaf were stolen. On the Monday, I was in a shop enquiring the prisoner's residence, and he came in; the moment he saw me, he made off, but was secured. I asked where he had been on the Saturday night; he said he went home at seven o'clock, and went to bed about eight. He lived about four months with me. WILLIAM MONS . I am apprentice to Mr. Robson. I did not sleep in the house. On Monday morning I was asked if I had left the iron safe open. I had locked it on the Saturday night, also the counting-house door. WILLIAM JOSEPH NEWMAN . I am apprentice to Mr. Robson. About half-past six o'clock on the Monday morning the servant came down and informed me she had found the street door open; I got up, went down stairs, and found the door leading from the counting-house to the warehouse open, as also the door leading from the passage to the counting-house. The iron safe was open. I went up stairs and found the keys lying in the parlour window, and one of the links of the chain broken, and the iron safe key lying loose on the chain. JOSEPH DOUGLAS . I saw the prisoner by the prosecutor's premises about eight o'clock on Saturday night,standing against the door. I did not know where he lived. I knew he was discharged from their service. JOSEPH MARTIN . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Monday, the 12th of October, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, in Lombard-street. I took him to the prosecutors' house, and told him the house had been entered on the Saturday night, and that he was suspected, and he had to clear his character, and say where he was that night; he said he lodged with his mother in Red-lion-court, Minories; that he was at home on Saturday night, in bed at eight o'clock; that he was taken ill about three o'clock in the morning, and did not get up till twelve o'clock on Sunday. I examined the premises; I believe the person must have entered by getting down the area grating where the coals are let down. I found a staple about three feet down there, so that any person going down must have torn their clothes with it. On searching the room the prisoner lodged in, I found a coat which appeared very dirty all round, as if the person had slid down the place; some of it appeared to be coal dust, but I cannot be certain of it. I asked him how his coat became torn (it had a slit in the back); he said he was not aware that it was torn, that it was a coat he did his dirty work in, and had it on on Saturday. I told him he had been seen in the street at the time; he said if any person had seen him it must have been at the Royalty, for he recollected he had been there, and was not in bed as he said at first; that he went in at the stage door of the theatre, and from there to what they call the fly. HENRY SLOWRAN . I am patrol of Tower Ward. As I was on my morning duty, about twenty minutes past six o'clock, I found the prosecutors' door open. I knocked three times, and rung the bell two or three times; at last the servant came down. I found no marks of violence there. NOT GUILTY .London Jury, before Mr. Recorder.",notGuilty,none

ARTHUR WIGGAN. I live on Dowgate-hill. On the 5th of October, between twelve and one o'clock, I was looking in at a print shop, in Sweeting's-alley - I stood there scarcely a moment, and did not perceive any thing; I used my handkerchief while I stood there - a gentleman came up and asked if I had lost it; I felt and missed it. I had seen the prisoners standing close to me at the shop - they were about three yards from me when the gentleman gave me the information - I laid hold of Franks and charged him with it - he denied it - I left him, as there were people to take care of him, and laid hold of Brown - he denied it; my handkerchief was picked up immediately after, close to the spot - the person who found it was about two yards from me.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was in a public part of the street - A. It is a very crowded place; several people were looking at the shop.MR. B. W. PIKE. I am a dry salter, and live in Miles's-lane. I was in Sweeting's-alley, and saw the prisoners acting in such a manner as to draw my attention, and in about a quarter of an hour I saw them immediately behind Mr. Wiggan, who was looking at the prints - one stood against each pocket. Brown had both his hands engaged, twisting a piece of paper round his thumb - Franks had his hands before him, close to Mr. Wiggan's pocket. Immediately on their quitting Mr. Wiggan, I went and asked him to feel in his pocket, and he missed his handkerchief. The prisoners were accosted about three yards from the spot, and at the end of the alley Franks ran away; I pursued him to the end of Bartholomew-lane - I had lost sight of him for a moment - I ran back, and at the end of Sweeting's-alley I saw him walking; I immediately touched him and said,""This is the man,"" and in a moment an officer came up and took him. The handkerchief was picked up five or six yards from the shop - it was utterly impossible for any persons to have done it but the prisoners. I placed myself behind the corner of the windows, and had a perfect view of their proceedings.Prisoner FRANKS. Q. Did you see me run, when in Sweeting's Alley - A. Yes; within three or four yards of the end of the alley.Q. You cannot swear positively who took the handkerchief - A. No, because they covered each other's operations. I did not see it taken or dropped. Three or four persons were round the shop, I will not swear there was not six, there was not seven; they were respectable persons. Brown did not take it. JOHN BRADEY . I am street-keeper. I was on duty at the North Gate; heard a cry of stop him - turned towards Sweeting's Alley, and saw Brown running; he was stopped in Threadneedle-street, before I could get up to him. Franks was brought to me, and one Samuel delivered me the handkerchief. The prisoners were much agitated, and begged hard to be let go. Brown was stopped between the corner of Bartholomew-lane, and the Cock, tavern.MR. PHILLIPS to MR. WIGGAN. Q. Did you not say you seized Brown a short distance from the window - A. Yes, the witness is mistaken, it was Franks that run, not Brown. I took Franks, but left him, and took Brown; then went again after Franks; he might have run, while I was away. JOHN BRADEY . I am sure Brown was running, when I turned round.MR. PIKE. I saw Franks running, but did not see Brown run; I had my eye on him for five minutes. I did not see him get from the persons round him, for I was engaged running after Franks; he might have run during that time.BROWN'S Defence. I walked away about six yards from the shop. Mr. Pike came up and said,""You are one of them."" I said,""What do you mean?"" Mr. Wiggan said I had got the handkerchief; he laid hold of me, and I was taken down to Bartholomew-lane - and about the middle of the lane, Bradey came up. I never run, for I was not let go.

We supposed that he came from the carrier; this was about four o'clock - and about six o'clock the boy came, and we found the trick out. THOMAS SAPWELL . I am a constable. On Sunday, afternoon, the 6th of October, about half-past two o'clock, in consequence of information, I went to a chandler's shop, No. 6, Petticoat-lane, and found the prisoner in the passage, with two large bundles by the side of her, containing the articles stated in the indictment; which Mrs. Cowie afterwards claimed. I asked how she came by them; she said she had a bundle from a gentleman at Temple-bar, to sell for 15 s. for him - and the other was linen she had to wash; but all the things had Mrs. Cowie's initials on them. I understood her to say, she brought it from Mrs. Hall, of Camomile-street. I took her into custody. I turned her handkerchief aside, and saw she had a clean shift on, marked J. C. or C. C. She endeavoured to make her escape - and while I left her in charge of Morris, she bit the mark out of the shift.MRS. CATHERINE COWIE . I am the wife of James Cowie .

Sapwell left the prisoner in my charge. I took her into a public house, and while I was attending to the mob, I looked round, and she was biting the linen at her breast; I caught hold of her - she kept pulling at the shift with her teeth, and bit part of it out. I asked why she did that? she said it was nothing to me.Prisoner's Defence. I had to take linen to Camomile-street, and Whitechapel. A person gave me a bundle of linen to wash, and said he would send for or fetch it. He left me in Petticoat-lane, for three-quarters of an hour - then brought the small bundle, and said he wanted 15 s. for it; a Jewess stood at the door, and asked if I had any thing to sell - I shewed it her.

In the Summer of 1819, I lodged in Blewitt's-buildings; the prisoner lodged in the same house. I was in search of employment - I had frequent conversation with him on the subject. He stated, that he had an uncle, Colonel Miller, who resided at Bethnal-green, but with whom he was then at variance - but it was his own fault, for he would not stoop to ask his uncle's pardon, or he would have forgiveness; he represented that Colonel Miller had been a late Director and proprietor in the India House - and that he could make great interest to obtain a situation in that house, and asked if I should object to one. I said I should be very glad of one. Soon after that, one morning (in May, or the beginning of June, I think,) he asked if I was particularly engaged that day, and if I had any writing paper - and if I would put some in my pocket, we could take a walk together in the afternoon. I did so, and we took a walk up Church-street, towards Bethnal-green - went into a public-house, which he said a friend of his kept. We went into the parlour, where we were alone; he asked for my paper, and wrote out four or five memorials; before that he had said that he could get me a situation, as messenger - and asked if I should object to wear livery. I said not. He then drew out some memorials, and wished me to make a fair copy of them; he had said, as we walked along, that he had had some conversation with his uncle, who thought from my hand-writing, and the situation I had held, (I had been in the Custom House), that the place would be too low for me, and he would use his influence to get me a situation as clerk. He drafted out four memorials, (looking at them), these are the drafts of them.These memorials were here read; they were addressed to four Directors, soliciting their interest on behalf of the prosecutor.Q. Were these memorials copied - A. I copied them, and gave to him to take to his uncle, who was to sign them, and distribute them to the different gentlemen. I saw him almost every evening; he represented to me, that his uncle had sent them to the Directors, and the business was going on in the regular channel. On the 29th of July, 1819. I met him by appointment, (with Holcroft, a friend of mine,) at the Crown and Thistle, public-house, Billiter-street, about four o'clock, and asked him my business was going on at the East-India House; he said every thing was done that was needful, and nothing wanting but the payment of the fees. I said if he would let me know the amount, I dare say I should be able to pay them; he said he did not know what they were, but if I and Holcroft waited there he would go to the India House and make enquiry. He left us and returned in about half an hour, and brought a slip of paper with the amount of fees - (looking at it) - this is it - (read, memorials written, 2 l. 8 s. 6 d.; fresh memorial for deputy chairmain, 10 s. 6 d.; five new ones, 1 l. 1 s. 3 d.; copy for records, 19 s.: - 4 l. 19 s. 3 d.) - I said it might as well be paid first as last, and I would go to my lodgings and fetch the money; he said""Well, if you do fetch it, don't fetch it in ones, but fetch a five-pound note, as it will look more respectable."" I went to my lodgings, and got five 1 l. notes, changed them for a 5 l. note, and brought it tohim - he said a complimentary letter ought to be written to Mr. Hudson, the clerk at the India House; he drafted one out. I went up to a private room, and copied it, came down, and shewed it him. He said it would do very well. I gave him the 5 l. note to convince him it was one - he returned it me; I folded it up in the letter, in the presence of him and Holcroft, sealed, and directed it to""H. Hudson, Esq., East India House,"" by his direction, and he had told me to fold the note in it. He said he did not wish to be seen further in it, but as my friend Holcroft was with me, he had better take the letter to the India House, and that would be proof that it did go, and he would go as far as the India House with him - they went out together for that purpose, and returned in about ten minutes; he said he was going to meet a party at his uncle's, and left. On the 4th of October, when I got to my lodgings, Mrs. Dowling, the landlady, gave me this letter, (looking at it, No. 1;) it is in a diguised hand; but I believe it to be the prisoner's writing - I told him I had received it. One evening Mrs. Dowling gave me another letter, this is it, (looking at it, No. 2,) I believe it to be his writing, but the hand is disguised. In consequence of this letter I went into the country to see my friends, but before I went he told me that on a clerk being appointed it was customary on the appointment being delivered to give a dinner to the other clerks - I said I had not the least objection to it if it was customary. He mentioned the dinner once or twice. I went to Lewes to see my friends, and while there I received this letter - (looking at it, No. 3) - it is his writing, and a day or two afterward I received another (No. 4), in consequence of which I went to the Bank at Lewes, paid in 14 l., and got this bill - (looking at it) - which I inclosed in a letter to the prisoner; the receipt at the back of it is in his handwriting. After this he came into the country on a visit to my friends. I saw him there frequently; he said every thing was finally arranged and settled, and that the dinner was at the Ship Tavern. Leadenhall-street. (A cheque upon Sir John Esdaile and Co, drawn by the Lewes Old Bank for 14 l., the receipt signed by the prisoner, was here read) - While I was in the country, I received another letter - it is in a disguised hand, but is the prisoner's writing - (looking at the letter, No. 6) - this is his writing. I afterwards discovered that it was entirely false, and that I had no appointment whatever.Q. How came you not to enquire at the India House sooner - A. I trusted entirely to him; and he always wanted me to avoid making enquiry, he said every thing was perfectly right. From the time he left Lewes till the 27th of September last, I never saw him; I took every pains to find him.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What age are you - A. Thirty-seven. I have had a situation in the Customs nine years, I did not get it by purchase; I first became acquainted with him at Blewitt's-buildings; our business was mostly conducted at public-houses. I might not be quite sober sometimes when I was with him. I have a perfect recollection of all our meetings.Q. As you have lost two sums of money, be so good as to tell us what false pretence obtained the 5 l. - A. To pay fees for the situation he said he had obtained for me. None of the letters came till after that. I believed Mr. Miller to be a Director, and that he was a Colonel, and expected it was by his interest only I was to obtain it.Q. When did he first tell you not to go to the India-House to make enquiries - A. In June, 1819; he told me so repeatedly, it never occurred to me that the letters were fabricated; but after the deception was discovered I compared one with the other, and find they are his writing. I took out a warrant to apprehend him, on the 27th of September, 1819, but could never find him. The letter dated the 21st of August obtained the 14 l. from me. I found the prisoner in Robinhood-court, Shoe-lane, on the 20th of September, 1822; I took an officer with me and he was apprehended. I am not to pay the expense of the prosecution.MR. WALFORD. Q. You presented a memorial to the India Company, and they took up the business - A. Yes.COURT. Q. Did he lodge in Blewitt's-buildings at the time he came to visit your friends in the country - A. Yes. I could not find him there after I discovered the deception.The letters referred to in the evidence were as follows: - No. 1, signed H. Hudson, dated, East-India-House, 4th of August, 1819; informing the prosecutor he was appointed an extra clerk, the appointment to commence on the 25th of September, and desiring him to appear before the Directors on the 22d to receive his instructions; and till then his appearance would be dispensed with, and desiring the payment of the fees of office.No. 2, dated the 11th August, signed H. Hudson, informing the prosecutor that every thing was settled; that he would be entitled to his seniority from this date, and acknowledging the payment of fees.No. 3, dated the 18th of August, from the prisoner to the prosecutor at Lewes, stating that the dinner was to take place next day, and desiring an answer by return of post, saying in what manner the bill was to be discharged, and proposing that a bill should be drawn for it.No. 4, dated the 20th of August; from the prisoner to Curtis, informing him that the dinner had taken place last night; and out of sixteen invited, thirteen sat down to dinner; some of whom were the most respectable in the house. That it was understood to be Colonel Miller's entertainment; that the bill was 12 l. 16 s. 4 d., and with 1 l. to be given to the waiters made 13 l. 16 s. 4 d.; and desiring the prosecutor to go to the Bank, pay 14 l. in, and forward an order for the cash.No. 5, addressed to prosecutor, dated East-India-House, 7th of September, signed H. Hudson; informing him that as a special ballot was appointed for twenty-two, the Court of Directors had postponed his attendance from the 22d to the 29th; when he must not fail to attend.No. 6, dated Bethnal-green, 14th August, addressed to J.D. Stone, Esq. Comptroller of Customs, signed Miller Douglas, of Stone and Webberly-park, congratulating him upon the appointment of the prosecutor. JAMES HOLCROFT . I live in Alfred-terrace, Stepney. I have known Mr. Curtis since 1814; I and he met the prisoner at the Crown and Thistle, public-house, Billeter-lane, several times, and recollect meeting there when he asked the prisoner how his business went on at the India House. I had met him before, when the subject was respecting the appointment of a clerk's situation in the India House; the prisoner said every thing was settled, except the fees of office being paid. Curtis asked him the amount of them; he went out to ascertainand returned in fifteen or twenty minutes with a slip of paper, with the fees on it, amounting to nearly 5 l. Curtis went home to fetch them; Douglas wished him to bring one note instead of small ones. Curtis fetched a five-pound note, and asked how he was to convey it to Mr. Hudson, whose name had been mentioned before in the conversation; the prisoner said,""You had better send Mr. Hudson a complimentary note;"" a form for which he drafted out. Curtis retired and copied it, enclosed the five-pound note, and sealed the letter, addressed it to H. Hudson, Esq. East-India House. The prisoner said I had better take it, and he would walk with me, which he did to the corner of Lime-street; and as we went along I said I was a stranger in the India House, and did not know where to deliver it; he said I was to deliver it to the messenger in the lobby, at the left hand entrance - which I did - and joined him at the corner of Lime-street. We returned to Curtis, and in about twenty minutes lie apologized for leaving us, saying, he was going to a party at his uncle's, Colonel Miller's, at Bethnal-green, and left. Curtis went into the country about the middle of August, and while he was there, I saw the prisoner at the Crown and Thistle, public-house; he said the gentleman at the India House had had the dinner the day before, (he had told me nothing about the dinner before,) he said they were the principal clerks in the house; he said the dinner was at the Ship, public-house, in Leadenhall-street; that the bill amounted to 14 l. altogether, and he was anxious that it should be paid. I said, I made no doubt, if he wrote to Mr. Curtis he would send the money by return of post. He wrote in my presence, and said he had left room for me to write what I chose; I said I had nothing to say - but wrote this postscript (looks at the letter).Cross-examined. Q. Were you present when the prisoner told him not to go to the India House - A. Yes; several times. I do not know what reason he assigned, as I paid very little attention to him. I have seen Curtis in liquor two or three times, but not often. He was not particularly addicted to liquor.Q. Did you hear Curtis swear at the Mansion House, that he wrote the paper with the amount of fees - A. I believe he did, but he wrote it from a copy, which Douglas shewed him. It does not appear to me to be his writing. The prisoner did not ask for the 5 l.; Curtis said it might as well be paid at once. He was not drunk when this business was transacted. HENRY DYMOND . I am a messenger at the India House. In the summer of 1819, the prisoner was a good deal about the India House, he came frequently after one of the messengers - I have seen him in the passage of one of the lobbies. I recollect Baird asking me to take a letter for him, and in the course of that day the prisoner asked me to deliver a letter to Curtis, at his lodgings. It was directed to Mr. J. Curtis, Blewitt's-buildings, Holborn - I gave it to the landlady. The prisoner had access to the passages and lobbies. Letters brought for the clerks were left in the left hand lobby, but since this matter has been discovered, an alteration has been made. I never saw the prisoner in that lobby - but any of the messenger's friends could go there without suspicion. EDWARD DENCH . I am a messenger in the Company's service, and was so in the summer of 1819. The prisoner was intimate with Baird a messenger. He had no appointment under the Company - he asked me to take a letter to Curtis, his fellow lodger, at Blewitt's-buildings, to meet him in the City. I gave it to Mrs. Dowling; (looking at it,) this is it. If a letter was brought for a clerk three years ago, it would be received by a messenger, and laid in the lobby window, or put into an open box. Anybody who knew the messengers, or a stranger at the lobby might take them. MARY DOWLING . I keep the house in Blewitt's-buildings. The prisoner and prosecutor lodged with me. In September, 1819, two East India Company's messengers brought two letters at different times, which I delivered to Curtis. The prisoner left my lodgings to go into the country - I expected him to return, but he did not - he had not settled with me exactly. I believe Curtis to be a sober man. JOHN COOKE . I am a messenger in the East India Company's service. In the summer of 1819, the prisoner was in the habit of coming to the house. I remember his coming one evening in the summer, about five o'clock, when I was at the front door; it was after office hours - he enquired for Mr. Baird; I said I believed he was gone; he said I should go with him to the George, public-house, St. Mary-axe, and have some drink - I refused, but he said I should, and I went. He asked what I chose to drink, I chose porter - he paid the reckoning, which was 15 d. or 18 d.; he gave the landlord a 5 l. note in payment, and received the change. I do not know whether it was a Bank note. HENRY THOMAS ADAMS . I keep the Ship, public-house, opposite the India House. In September, 1819, there was no dinner of the India House clerks at my house, nor in August - nor any dinner at which the prisoner and Mr. Hudson were present. I do not know the prisoner. No bill of 13 l. odd was paid me for a dinner. JOHN CONNYERS HUDSON . I am clerk to the Committee of College, at the East India House. (Looking at the three letters,) Neither of these are my writing. I knew nothing of the subject till this charge was made. I never received a 5 l. note as payment of fees, for any appointment. There are two other clerks of my name in the house. CHARLES HUDSON . I am clerk of the Treasury in the East India House. Neither of the letters are my writing. I know nothing of it. I knew nothing of the affair till this investigation took place. I never received a letter with a 5 l. note from Curtis, to pay fees of admission. ROBERT HUDSON . I am clerk in the Home Audit Office, in the India House. The letters are not written by me. I knew nothing of the matter till the investigation took place, and have received no 5 l. note to pay fees.MR. WILLIAM MILLER . I live at Bethnal-green - the defendant is my nephew by half blood. He never made any interest with me to get Curtis a situation. I have no interest at all in the house, and do not know the four Directors alluded to, except by name. He did not live with me. I knew nothing of this negotiation, and never saw Curtis. THOMAS LOWES . I am clerk to Sir James Esdaile . This bill was paid in 1819, by me. The person receiving it wrote his name on it - I suppose as I paid it then.MR. ANDREWS, addressed the Jury on behalf of the prisoner. GUILTY . Aged 27.

NICODEMUS DUNN , CHARLES DUNN , JOSEPH DUNN , MICHAEL LEARY , and GEORGE MOSS , were indicted for stealing, on the 29th of September, four live tame geese, price 12 s. , the property of Alexander Fletcher . JOHN ROGERS . I am servant to Mr. Alexander Fletcher , of Homerton. On the morning of Michaelmas day, about ten o'clock, I went to open a gate, about four miles from my master's house, and saw all the prisoners except Leary, playing at pitch in the hole - they were in my master's field; I ordered them out - they refused to go because my master would not give them a job. I left them, and in about an hour heard a great noise among the geese, which were let out in the field - I went and missed four; I had seen them all safe about nine o'clock. I and my master went and found three of them lying dead - one had its head cut off, and the others were cut in the head - they were in the field. One of them was thrown over the hedge. We took them home, and went to look for the other, and at the end of the path we saw the five prisoners sitting on a gate - they walked round the field; we went on, and the constable took them. JAMES MORTON . I am a basket maker, and live at Homerton. On Michaelmas day, I was going along the field, and saw two bricklayers before me, and a young man behind me. The path is a thoroughfare, two geese were lying on the right side of the path, and one on the left - I jumped over the fence, and threw them into the footpath. We took them to Mr. Fletcher's house. I saw Rogers in the field; we went to look for the other one - and saw the five prisoners sitting on a white gate, about a quarter of a mile from where the geese were. They walked away; we went back - but the officers called us, and we went after them; I saw them sitting by the side of the river Lea; they walked over the locked gate - we pursued them, and they walked through a branch of the river; it was about up to their knees. JOHN GARVA . I am a constable. I went after the prisoners, and saw them cross the river. I went through after them. Moss was secured, and brought to us. I knew him before, and am sure he is one of them. There was blood on his coat, and I found a knife on him - he said the blood was with liver, which he went to get for his mother, and put it under his coat. NICODEMUS DUNN . Q. Did not Moss tell you, Charles Dunn cut off the goose's head - A. No.COURT. Q. Look at this deposition, is your signature to it - A. Yes.Q. It says here,""Moss confessed it, and said that Charles Dunn cut off the heads"" - A. Yes, but I understood the prisoner to ask me if I did not tell Moss to say so - he did say Charles Dunn cut the head off. JOSHUA POTTER . I am a constable. I apprehended all the prisoners but Moss, about a quarter past six o'clock, on the 29th of September. Nicodemus Dunn had a fowl; I found a bloody knife on him, and a box of dominos. ROBERT PRESCOTT . I was in company with Garva - as we went along, Moss said that Charles Dunn cut the head off one of the geese, and he was frightened, and ran off; that Nicodemus Dunn took the other geese over into the next field. NICODEMUS DUNN 's Defence. I ran away, because I thought the officers were after me for pitching in the hole, on Sunday.CHARLES DUNN's Defence.

t18221023-55,theft,grandLarceny,imprison,publicWhipping,18221023,"WILLIAM DODGE , was indicted for stealing, on the 19th of October, four hundred and forty pounds of hay, value 10 s. the goods of John Amer . JOHN AMER . I am a farmer, and live at Perry Dale. On the 19th of October I lost eight trusses of hay out of a cart-house of a farm, two miles from my house. It is worth about 18 s. or 20 s. I was out in the evening, and found the prisoner had been taken and liberated.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did you first see him - A. On Sunday morning, when I took him. He said he had bought the hay, and could prove it. WILLIAM WILKINSON . I am servant to Mr. Amer. On Friday afternoon, I tied up two dozen trusses in the cart-house; I left it safe about six o'clock in the evening, and about six is the morning, I went and missed eight trusses, which was too much for one man to carry; the cart-house is close against the road; the prisoner was a stranger to me. I told my master, and on Sunday I went with him and found the prisoner in his own house at Isleworth, three or four miles off, close to the Brentford-road. We found the hay on his premises; some of it was shaken about - there were five trusses and a quantity loose lying there. I put my hand into the truss, and found a shell which I had put in the middle of them. I am sure it is the hay I bound. RICHARD KIRBY . I am bailiff to Mr. Johnson, whose farm is about a mile and a half from Amer's. On Saturday morning, the 19th of October, about half-past five o'clock, I was in Mr. Johnson's field, and heard a cart stop opposite a cabbage field; I listened and heard the cabbages crack, and thought somebody was stealing. I went over, and found the prisoner with four cabbages in his hand, and the horse and cart stood there with about eight trusses of hay in it. I secured him for taking the cabbages. He was discharged, being fined 10 s. He said he wanted to go to Kingston market, and so I sent a man with him, to deliver up his cart of hay, and then bring him back to me. MOSES RYDER . I am a constable. The prisoner was given into my charge on Sunday morning, for stealing the hay; he did not account for how he got it. JOHN GOODWIN . I am a labourer, and work for Mr. Johnson. Last Saturday week, as I was going to work about a quarter past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner standing by his horse in the road, by the cabbage field. When I got up to the cart, Kirby asked if I knew him - I said I had seen him before. Some trusses of hay were in the cart - I did not count them. He expressed his sorrow for taking the cabbages. I knew nothing of the hay then; he was then about a mile from his own house, and about two miles from where the hay was taken. WILLIAM DENNISON . I am a constable. I was ordered by the High Constable to take the prisoner in charge on the Sunday morning. He said he bought the hay and paid for it, and could bring proof; he did not say where he bought it. I kept one of the hay bands. WILLIAM WILKINSON . That is part of the hay band - it is coarse stuff which had grown by the water side.Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday morning early, I was hired by Sarah Peet to go to the Feathers, public-house, at Ealing, for some goods which were coming by the Birmingham waggon; they did not come. I turned away from the public-house, and at a short distance a man came up with a one-horse load of hay, and a straw cart behind; he asked if I wanted to buy any hay; I said No, I had not got money enough to buy a load; he said he would sell a small quantity, and asked 2 s. 3 d. a truss. I said I could buy it at 2 s. at home, and agreed for six trusses; and while he was putting them from his cart into mine, a man whom I had been acquainted with for a number of years came up. I said,""Robert, can you lend me 6 s.?"" He said, No, for he was going to pay some money; but he lent me half a crown, which I bought two more trusses with. WILLIAM DENNISON . He said he bought it by the Feathers. RICHARD KIRBY . The Feathers is nearly a mile from the cabbage field. SARAH PEET . I live at Smallborn-green. I know the prisoner. Last Saturday week I employed him to fetch a bed and a few other things, that came from my mother's at Birmingham; he came to me between the Old Hat and Feathers, public-house, at ten minutes after five o'clock. I accompanied him to the Feathers to meet the waggon; it did not come; I walked by the side of the cart. A man came up with some hay in a one-horse cart, near the Feathers trough; he had a straw cart and another hay cart also. The man said,""Do you want to buy a truss or two of hay?"" he said""Perhaps you sell it too dear for me, I can buy it cheap at home."" He bought six trusses, and was to give 2 s. a truss, and then bought two more, as a man came up who knew him and lent him 2 s. 6 d.; the man unloaded it, and he put it up in his cart. I went down to the other public-house to look if my goods had been left there. I left the prisoner; (he wanted to go home in a hurry), to go to Kingston market, and was to come for my things if they arrived.COURT. Q. What public-houses did you go to enquire at - A. To the Two Hats and Green Man; they are about one hundred yards from the Feathers. I was to go to the Blackhorse, public-house, Shepherd's-bush, if they were not there, and so I did not require him to wait, as he was in a hurry to go to Kingston market. I called at his house as I went along, between one and two o'clock in the morning; I went to meet the waggon, as my sister was coming with the goods; she is not come yet, as my mother is ill and cannot spare her. Robert Young lent him the 2 s. 6 d.; he called him Bob. I have since heard him say his name is Robert Young ; the prisoner's son fetched him, and told him of it at the prisoner's house on Sunday.Q. How came you there - A. I went there - I told the Magistrate this story.Q. Did you not think it odd he should buy hay on the road when he could get it as cheap at home - A. No. I had applied to him overnight for his horse and cart; he said he would come. I called again in the morning, as I wanted him to go with me; his wife answered me out of the window. ROBERT YOUNG . I am a labourer, and live at Twickenham - and have known the prisoner ten years - he works with a horse and cart. Last Saturday week, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I saw him stand with his cart, and a load of hay on another cart. I was going to Covent-garden market, after apples.Q.What brought you to the Feathers - A. I had business that way. I lent him 2 s. 6 d. - I cannot say what for, but believe it was to buy hay. I came away directly. The Feathers is six miles from Twickenham. I had to call on one Rook, at Ealing, whom I buy apples for; his house is about two hundred yards beyond the Feathers. The hay cart might have a load of hay on it. I did not see the trusses taken out. I was close to the prisoner's cart - there was no hay in that, when I lent him the 2 s. 6 d. I think there was a woman there, but am not certain. I went away as soon as I gave him the half-crown; he did not say what he wanted it for, that I recollect. GUILTY . Aged 56.

t18221023-56,theft,burglary,death,none,18221023,"EDWARD M'WILLIAMS was indicted for burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Samuel Skelton , about the hour of one in the night of the 10th of September, at St. George's, Bloomsbury, with intent to steal, and burglariously stealing therein, one teapot, value 10 l.; sixty brooches, value 20 l.; thirty-five watch-keys, value 15 l.; fifty-five seals, value 60 l.; one hundred and fifty-two rings, value 47 l.; seventy-three pair of ear-rings, value 73 l.; thirty-six gold pins, value 11 l.; thirty-three silver pencil-cases; value 9 l.; one silver snuff-box, value 30 s.; four silver boxes, value 3 l.; seventeen silver spoons, value 6 l.; three pair of silver sugar tougs, value 30 s.; three watches, value 10 l., and twelve black lead pencils, value 2 s. his property.MR. ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution. SAMUEL SKELTON . I am a jeweller, and rent a house in Upper King-street, in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. On the night of Tuesday, the 10th of September, I was the last person in the shop, but not the last person up; I barred and bolted the shop, and locked the back parlour door, and took the key up stairs with me. All the windowsand doors were safe. I went to bed about a quarter before eleven o'clock, and did not get up till seven o'clock in the morning. I went to the parlour door (nobody had been there before me that morning); I found the door bolted inside, and could not get in. I went out at the private door, and found the shop door ajar - it opens into the street. I had secured it with a bar across the middle, and two bolts; it had been opened from inside; the entrance had been made by the parlour door - how they got there I cannot say - they must have entered by a false key. I found the inside window sash drawn aside, and missed the articles stated in the indictment; there were not above forty seals, worth 45 l.; the black lead pencils were in the pencil cases; the total value of the property was about 200 l. I found a punch ladle handle on the floor - the silver bowl had been broken off and taken away. I should know some of the ear-rings again - some of them were quite a new pattern, which I had only bought five days before. I always write my private mark on the pencils, with the price, on a place which I cut for the purpose. Some pencils have been found, which have the marks all cut off from the place I usually cut them; it is not usual to cut them, to put a mark on. I went directly to Bow-street; and in consequence of information, I went with the officers on the 11th of October, to a place we were directed to, and as we were at the back of Pancras New Church, we met the prisoner with a woman; the officer said,""Ned, I want you, and Charlotte, I want you."" They asked what he wanted them for; he said, to go to their lodging; one of them said,""We don't lodge here, we lodge at Marylebone."" The prisoner began to be restive, and he was obliged to be handcuffed. We took them to Draper's-place, Burton-crescent; the officer then said to the woman,""Which house is it?"" She looked round, and said,""I don't know this place, I never was here in my life,"" (the prisoner was close to her, and said nothing); the officer told me to knock at No. 27, which I did, and said to the landlady,""Do you know this lady and gentleman?"" She said,""Yes, they lodge here;"" they did not contradict her - the officers went up stairs and searched. The prisoner went into the first floor with them, and the woman into the second. A pair of ear drops were produced, which I knew, the tops of these drops were found in the woman's ears, and taken out before the Magistrate and compared. I knew them to be the same which I bought on the 5th of September. I saw the officer take twenty-two pencils from the prisoner's pocket - they were cut as I cut them to put into pencil cases; I knew them in a moment, and have not the least doubt in the world of their being part of the property stolen that night. I found a handkerchief in a chair by the shop window, and a dark lantern on a table in my parlour, and a piece of silk on it. I was present when the officers found some skeleton keys, crow Bars, and phosphorous boxes.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you never seen pencils put ready into cases - A. They are always so, I always cut a flat place to put the mark on. There is one pencil among them, which I can swear I had one exactly like; it is black with rubbing up and down; I had had it a long time by me; it went very stiff in the case. The ear-rings are brought to me by persons who get them from the wholesale shops. I was with the prisoner till Bond had done searching the room. I did not see him take the pencils from any where, and put them into his pocket, it was a month after the robbery. When I saw the bottoms of the ear-rings, I doubted about them - but when I saw the bottoms and tops together, I had no doubt, I had sold none of that pattern. WILLIAM BOND . I am a Bow-street officer. I went with the prosecutor on the 10th of October, in search of this property - Davis accompanied us. Just at the back of the New Pancras Church, I met the prisoner with a female on his arm; Davis said""Here they come."" I took one, and he the other. I did not know the prisoner by name. I did not hear Davis address him; I took the prisoner, and he the woman. I asked him where he lived; he said in Marylebone. I said I was not satisfied about that. Davis said,""I know where you live."" I don't recollect whether he made any answer. He resisted, and we handcuffed him, and took him to the house; I was not the first who got there. Davis or Skelton knocked. A woman came to the door; Davis asked if they did not lodge there; she said Yes. I took the prisoner up one pair of stairs; the prosecutor was with us. I did not know then but that was the room he lived in. I searched him, and found a box key, which he said belonged to his chest or box. I found two more, one a latch, and the other a fall key; I asked how he came by them - he said""What of that?"" On searching his coat pockets, I found a small bundle of pencils, and a small screw-driver - he had a pair of pincers in his hand, when we took him. At the top of the cupboard I found two latch keys, a file, a broken key, five skeleton keys, and a large drop key, they were wrapped up in a piece of green moreen, and then in brown paper. Mr. Skelton found some duplicates, which do not relate to the charge. I asked if the keys belonged to him - he said No, and that he knew nothing about them. During this time, Davis was up stairs with the woman; he brought a bag of keys down, which we took to the office. I went to a place at the back of Newcastle-street, Oxford-street, with the key which he said belonged to his chest; Mr. Skelton directed me then, and in a box there, I found a bunch of large keys, and a bunch of small ones - three of which I take to be skeleton keys. The woman stood at the bar, before the Magistrate, with him. I then took from her ears, a pair of ear-rings, without drops. Davis produced a pair of drops, which were matched with the tops; the prosecutor was then quite positive that they were his. I think what the woman said was taken in writing.Cross-examined. Q. When Davis and you met them, were you near each other - A. As near as we could be - but the prisoner made so much noise. I could not hear what Davis said; I had a bad cold in my head, and could not hear well. I understood they lodged on the second floor. I found the keys on the first.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who took you into that room - A. The door was open. He claimed nothing in that room.MR. SKELTON. I sent Bond to Castle-street, in consequence of information. JOHN DAVIS . I accompanied the prosecutor and Bond; and near the end of Draper's place, by Pancras Church, I saw the prisoner and his wife - she lives with him. I knew them before; I said"" Ned I want you, and Charlotte I want you."" The prisoner said""What do you wantof me, where is your warrant?"" I said""We don't want a warrant."" He was very obstreperous - Bond handcuffed him. I said we must go to their lodging; he said they did not lodge there, they lodged in Marylebone; I said I knew better, and desired him to come to Draper's place. I went first with the women, and Bond followed close with the prisoner. I desired the woman to go to her lodging; she said she did not lodge there - the prisoner was close to her, and must have heard her. I then knocked at No. 27 - the landlady opened the door. I asked her if they lodged there; she said""Oh yes, they do."" They made no answer. We went up stairs to the front room, first floor. I first tried the back room door, and could not open it for some time; then we went into the front room. Bond searched, and found what he has produced. The landlady saw us go into the first floor - neither she nor the prisoner said it was not their room. I took the woman up to the second floor, and began searching the front room there - and in a cupboard, (which was open), by the side of the fire-place, I found a quantity of duplicates, and among them, one relating to a ring, which led me to Baxter's, in Norfolk-street, Middlesex Hospital. I have kept the duplicate ever since; it is dated the 21st of September, 1822. I saw a little box in the room, but could not find the key; after looking in both rooms, the woman found the key at the foot of the bed, in the back room. I found nothing in the box, and proceeded to search further about the closets, and on the top of the closet by the fireside, I found a small crow bar; it has been used, and is broken. I went into the back room, (the bed-room), the woman gave me the keys - and in a box in the room, the key of which was on a ring with others she gave me, I found a pair of gold drops of ear-rings, wrapped in cotton. I heard her say something about them, before the Magistrate, but it was not taken down in writing I am quite certain; the prisoner stood by her at the time; the clerk was not writing. She said her brother had brought them fifteen or eighteen months ago. The prisoner said nothing to it. I continued the search and found twenty-four skeleton keys, in a bag, in a closet, at the top of two pair of stairs - and in the same bag were four Bramah's keys, and one key which would open a French lock; five of the keys which were in the bag, were in a small bag by themselves, within the large one - they appeared to be more used than the others. And in a closet in the bed-room, I found three phosphorus boxes, and some matches with them. The prisoner was committed, and the woman discharged as his wife.Cross-examined. Q. Do you know O'Hare - A. I have known a man of that name. I do not know whether he ever lodged there. The prisoner's lodging is on the second floor.MR. SKELTON. I believe the ear-rings to be part of the property stolen - A. I had some precisely of that pattern. The pencils are all cut in the place where I cut them, to mark them, except one - here is one which I observed with black marks, from moving up and down in the case; it is a particularly small size, which I could not sell; it is cut where I cut mine - here is one cut through to the lead to cut the mark off.Cross-examined. Q. All you know is that they have cuts at the bottom - A. No; There were two or three which were left on sale or return, and them I did not cut or mark - the cases of them are a new pattern. One of those pencils are here. I found no cases. Customers generally move the pencils in and out when they look at them. Here is one not marked at all - that is cut, but not by me. I have no mark on the ear-rings. Here are twenty-one pencils in all; one has been cut for the purpose of writing. JOSEPH SADDINGTON . I am foreman to a working jeweller. (Looking at the ear drops,) I think these are my manufacture. I have the punch I made them from - I have no doubt that the drops and tops have been manufactured by this punch. It was invented by myself six months ago.Cross-examined. Q. Had you sold any - A. Some dozens to different tradespeople.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You sold none eighteen months ago - A. No; the pattern was not in existence then. JOHN CORDY CROUCH . I am shopman to Mr. Baxter, a pawnbroker, of Norfolk-street, Middlesex Hospital. The duplicate produced belongs to our shop. I have the article corresponding with it - it was pawned by a woman whom I do not know. I have not seen her at Bow-street. It is for a chased ring, pawned on the 21st of September, in the name of Wilson. SAMUEL SKELTON . I cannot swear to it.Prisoner. I have nothing to say. WILLIAM BAILEY . I am a bedstead maker, and live in Marylebone-passage, Well-street, Oxford-street. The prisoner worked for me at making press bedsteads. On the night of the 10th of September, I was at the White Horse, public-house, Castle-street, Oxford-market, where there is a club held, and was in the prisoner's company there from ten o'clock till half-past ten. He was very much intoxicated at half-past ten, in such a state that he could hardly walk out of the parlour. I observed at the time that Teddy had got his whack.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know his wife - A. Only by her coming backward and forward to the shop. I don't belong to the club. I don't know where he lives, as he had moved once or twice. He earned 23 s. or 24 s. a week.COURT. Q. Did he work at home, or at your warehouse - A. Yes; I have frequented this house for four years.Q. What makes you remember the 10th of September, from any other night - A. He had had some beer at my shop in the morning, and through that he got drunk, and in the evening he went to the White Horse; he was formerly clerk to the club, and was so drunk he could not manage the books. It was on Tuesday night; the club is held every Tuesday night.Q. What makes you remember the 10th of September, from any other Tuesday night - A. He had a bedstead to make for himself, and was at work at it; the turner was to bring the feet of it home on Saturday, and did not till Monday. He was taken up a month or three weeks after. I know it was on the night of the robbery.Q. How do you know that - A. Why, the turner mentioned in our shop, that he had passed the house at the time the robbery was committed. I saw in the newspaper, a week after, that the robbery was in King-street - and that it was committed on the 12th. I have known him drunk before; he was not given to drink.Q. What makes you certain of the date - A. I referredto the club-books a fortnight ago, and reckoned that was the night he was drunk, because another man signed the book instead of him, as he was drunk; the book of that night is not his writing. JOSEPH ATTWOOD . I have known the prisoner two years, and am master of the club; he acted as secretary on club nights, which are Tuesdays. I produce the club-book which he keeps, and find that on the third Tuesday in the month he did not act, as the book is not in his writing; he has only signed the book on one Tuesday in the month, that is, the 24th. On the 3d and 10th Mr. Cantlin signed it, because the prisoner was drunk; he was not there on the 17th; he was rather drunk on the 3d, to the best of my recollection; the names of those present are not entered. Bailey was in the room on the night of the 10th, as a visitor. I remember Coleman (one of the members) asking if the prisoner was not liable to a fine, as he was not able to sign the book. The club broke up about ten or half-past ten o'clock; the prisoner was very drunk, and just able to walk out of the room.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What club is this - A. A shoe-club. Here is his writing on the 24th, it is only the words""in hand;""""J. Hopkins"" is not his writing. I will swear they are not both written by the same hand; the landlord always signs the book; he paid his fees that night - a member only pays once.Q. Then he was never at the club till then - A. Yes; but had not paid; he was there on the first and second Tuesday in the month. WILLIAM CANTLIN . I know the prisoner. I don't belong to the club, but was at it on the night of the 10th, when he was there very tipsy; I was at another table with a person; the prisoner was very tipsy, and the clerk asked the favour of me to settle the book for him, being secretary to a tailor's club, which meets at that house, and I did; I settled the book once before - (looking at it) - here is my writing in it on the 10th.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long before had you settled it - A. On the 3d; he was absent that night. I cannot say what hour he went away, it might be ten or half-past ten o'clock.COURT. Q. Are you sure he was not there on the 3d - A. Yes; positive. It was his place to settle the book every night, if he was there.Q. Was he drunk on the 3d - A. I cannot say whether he was there or not.Q. You have said he was not - A. I may be mistaken; but recollect very well his being there on the 10th, and Bailey remarking,""Teddy has got his whack tonight."" CHARLOTTE LESLIE . I live with the prisoner, but am not his wife. On the 10th of September I fetched him home from the White-Horse, Castle-street; he was very tipsy indeed. We lived at that time in Little Barlow-street, High-street, Marylebone; he slept with me that night, and did not not go out till between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, when he went to work.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time in the evening did you go to the club for him - A. The watchman went half-past ten o'clock as I went into Cavendish-square. I went into the passage and sent the servant into the club-room for him; I saw Mr. Beech there, and Mr. Bailey came out of the door at the same time and spoke to me; while I was waiting there he said something; as he passed I said,""How do you do Mr. Bailey?"" he nodded to me and went in again; he said nothing about the prisoner's situation. I waited there about a quarter of an hour. We did not live in Draper's-buildings then, but have since.Q. How long before the 10th of October, had you lived there - A. Four days; we moved every thing from our last lodging, which was in Little Brownlow-street, where we went to live on the 1st of August. We had the second floor in Draper's-buildings, and had slept there the night before the officers stopped us in the street; the prisoner was going to work then; he had stopped at home to hang a window. I have lived with him between nine and ten years, some people call me by his name; I told the Magistrate I was not his wife. He was taken up three years ago, but discharged by Mr. Birnie immediately; that only happened once to my knowledge. I was taken up the same night, and was brought here as a witness then against a relation of mine.Q. What particular reason have you for remembering this was on the 10th of September - A. Because Bartholomew Fair ended on the Friday before.COURT. Q. When the officer took you, you lodged in Draper's Buildings - A. Yes; I said I did not live there, as I did not wish then to create a piece of work in the neighbourhood - Q. How long have you had the skeleton keys - A. Ten months, I had them of a brother of mine; they were in a bag, and he told me where they were, and he said he did not like them to be there, and I fetched them.Q. Where from - A. From a place where he had hid them.Q. Where was that - A. In a field, if you must know, at Paddington - they were hid under a hedge, with the crow. I hung them in a bag in the cupboard, at the top of the stairs; there was no bolt or any thing on the door. He told me to fetch them from the field - I have had them ever since. I lodged at that time in Margaret-court, and moved from there to Suffolk Mews.Q. Did you carry the picklock keys and crow-bar with you - A. Yes; I put them in a dust pail - I did not like to leave them behind, as I knew they were not right things - they were not kept for use. I did not like them to be exposed, or I should have sold them.Q. Did you not think, if they were found in your possession, you would get into trouble - A. I thought if any honest person had them there was no harm. I did not clean them - some of them were wrapped up - I never opened them. I advised my brother to let them be where they were, but he said they might be found, and some mischief come of them. I have had them at four different lodgings. Two of the phosphorus boxes belonged to my brother and were in the bag; they were of no service - I could never get a light with them. - (Upon being tried in Court, the phosphorus produced a light instantly.) - I do not know who lodged on the first floor. The White Horse is a mile and a half or two miles from Barlow-street. He did not come home to tea that afternoon, which made me think he might be drunk - he was very drunk;he held by my arm. I am certain I spoke to Bailey there; he came out into the passage; I went and stood talking to some women at the door, and saw the prisoner come out. I did not see Bailey return to the room.GUILTY - DEATH .Of stealing in the dwelling-house, but not of breaking and entering .First Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Recorder.",guilty,lesserOffence

Bank post bills , their property.MR. ALLEY conducted the prosecution. HARSKY GISBORNE . I live at Manchester. On Saturnoon afternoon, the 13th of July, I paid Samuel Stanway , on account of the prosecutors, one 100 l., two of 50 l., and three of 30 l. Bank post bills. SAMUEL STANWAY . I am in the employ of the prosecutors, at Manchester. I received from Mr. Gisborne, at the warehouse, one 100 l., two 50 l., and three 30 l. Bank post bills. I took particular notice of the 100 l. bill, as I had never seen such a large one before. I am fifteen years old. Cole and Co. was written on the back of it; and Cunliffe and Co. was on the back of the two 50 l. notes. The prisoner was a porter at the warehouse, and was at the counting-house door at the time the money was paid. Mr. Hall did not come to the warehouse that night, and so I did not pay him the money. When I received it, the prisoner advised me to put it into my own drawer in the counting-house, which I did, and locked it; and as Mr. Hall did not come, I put the money in the waste-book, and put that into the iron chest, and locked it up. He did not see me put it there. The key of the chest was on the bunch of keys which it was his duty to take to Mr. Hall every night after he locked up the warehouse; he lodged at Mr. Hall's house; the warehouse was shut up at eight o'clock, and before that the prisoner asked where I had put the money; I said into a safe place. On the Monday morning, I saw him at the warehouse door - it was his duty to open it at half past eight o'clock. I went there at that time, and waited till nine; when I saw him, he said Mr. Hall would not trust him with the keys, because he thought he had had them in his coat pocket on the Sunday; but that he had left them in his other coat pocket, at the house; and that Mr. Hall desired I should come for them. I went for them, and the servant gave them to me. I returned to the warehouse, and gave them to him. He opened the front door, and took the books out of the iron safe as usual, and put them on the desk; he remained in the warehouse a few minutes. He usually goes to the Post Office for the letters - I asked if he wanted any money to pay for the letters; he said he had some. He went out as if to go to the Post Office, and never returned. GEORGE HALL . I conduct the business for Messrs. William Leighton , John Paley , William Petty , and Lawrence Harrison . I live in Bedford-street, about a mile from the warehouse. It was the prisoner's duty to bring me home the keys nightly, if I was not there, and take them in the morning. I do not know whether he brought them on Saturday, the 13th of July. I did not miss them till the Monday morning about half-past eight o'clock, as he did not come into my room for them; I found he had been out, and on looking for the keys, I found they were not there. Almost immediately after, he came into the room; he had not slept at home that night; he came into my bedroom with the keys; I asked him where they had been; he said he left them in his old coat pocket on Saturday night; I blamed him for it, and said I would not trust him with them again, and told him to put them down and send the boy for them. Shortly after Stanway came for the keys, and about an hour afterwards I heard the prisoner had absconded - he had lived about eight months with us. I heard of him again in the middle of September, and came to town; I found him in custody; he denied the charge. JOHN HART . I am a salesman, and live in Holywell-street, Strand. The prisoner came to my house to buy some clothes the day before I changed that 100 l. Bank post bill. He asked for a travelling cloak, saying he was going to Paris - he bought articles to the amount of 10 l. and tendered me a 50 l. Bank post bill. I went out to see if it was good, and found it was. I returned to him, and found that during my absence, my boy had sold him goods to the whole amount of the bill - he made another purchase to the amount of 45 l., besides the 50 l.; it was a gold watch, seals, pencil, and clothes, and tendered a 100 l. Bank post bill for that. I found it was good, and agreed to take it. I gave him thirty-five sovereigns; rode with him to the Black Horse, inn, with part of the goods, to see if he lodged there; he told the waiter I would not give him his change; I gave him 10 l. more, as the waiter said he knew him - the waiter went home with me, and I gave him the rest. He bought a box with the goods, and had a brass plate put on it, with the name I. H. Holmes on it. Next morning he called in a coach, for the rest of the goods, and asked me if it was all right. I said Yes. He had told me he had a pension in the army of 200 l. per annum, and that he got this money at the death of his mother. He called again on his return from Paris about three weeks after, and wanted to sell me part of the things I had sold him, but I refused. I received the 100 l. Bank bill at the Bank myself. I have since seen it.JURY. Q. You seemed to want change, why not offer him the 50 l. bill back - A. He said he was going to Paris, and wanted change. SOLOMON GOODMAN . I am shopman to Mr. Hart. His account is correct. I saw the prisoner give him both the bills. SAMUEL FARQUHAR . I am a clerk in the Bank. I produce the 50 l. and the 100 l. Bank post bills. JOHN HART . These are what he paid me; his name is on them. SAMUEL STANWAY . These are two of the bills I received.MR. CUNLIFFE. This 50 l. bill is endorsed by one of our partners. GUILTY , Aged 23.

I am a partner in the firm of George Hale and Co., there are other partners. We are brewers, carrying on business in Redcross-street; the prisoner is one of our draymen. Within the last twelve months we have lost casks in value amounting to 1200 l., each cask being worth 23 s. JOHN CLINTON . I am an officer. I was employed by the prosecutors to watch the prisoners, on the 3d of October, from the brew-house in Redcross-street, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning. The prisoners attended the dray. It at first had about eight casks of beer on it. They went over Blackfriar's-bridge, turned up Beer-lane, Southwark, and left two full barrels at a workhouse there, and received three empty ones; and at a public-house, in Churlotte-street, they left two full ones, and received one empty one. They then went round into Westminster-road, Walters left the other. The next delivery was at the White-hart, public-house, Walworth-road; one cask was left there, and none returned; they next went to the Duke's Head, public-house, Borough, where they left one and received two empty ones; then they went to a court in Gracechurch-street, to a public-house, and received four empty casks, but delivered none. They then went on different cads to York-street, Bethnal-green, and stopped under a gateway, at the end of a brewery, with Richard Clark and Co. written in front. Walters had joined the other, and was with him at this time. They both left the dray, and went into Clark's brewery. I saw them in conversation with Clark; they then both came out of the brewery, round the corner of the dray - took four of the barrels out of the dray, pitched three on the ground, and put the fourth on the top of them. They left them at the corner of the brewery, and returned into the brewery. I immediately went and looked at all four casks, they had""Hale, Red Cross-street,"" burnt very deeply on the head of all of them. The prisoners came out of the brew-house - each took one into Clark's brew-house, returned and fetched the other two - and as they brought them into the yard, Clark took them from them, and put them into the back part of the premises. They all three smiled together, Clark took his jacket, and all three came out together. Next day I went to Clark's brewery with Knight, and watched for Clark - he did not come until eight o'clock in the evening - and at that time was driving a horse with a little dray, with six or seven empty casks on (the dray the prisoners drove it would not hold a great many casks;) four of Mr. Hale's casks were on Clark's dray. As he was backing his dray into the yard, I went up to him, and asked if his name was Clark - he said No, it was Wright. I laid hold of him - he struggled most powerfully. I believe I broke his wrist, and my partner cut his head; his little boy who was with him, called out,""Mother, mother,"" which the people mistook for a cry of murder - a mob collected; a dog was let loose on us, and Clark escaped. We found nineteen casks on the premises with the names taken out.LACEY - GUILTY . Aged 38.WALTERS - GUILTY . Aged 27.See Page 584.

JAMES FISHER . On Tuesday the 24th of September, between two and three o'clock, I took a trunk and band box to the Spread Eagle inn, Piccadilly, and gave them to Fearns the porter; the bandbox was tied with a strong cord and handkerchief; it contained a bonnet and some caps and a handkerchief. I saw the prisoner about there. I saw Fearns put the trunk into the front boot, and the bandbox into the coach; the prisoner was sitting in the coach at the time. I went towards home to meet my wife, and returned with her to the coach; and on the door being opened for her to get in, I saw the string of the bandbox off, and the handkerchief partly untied. I said to the prisoner,""You are the only person in the coach, and was here when the box was put in; I must know who took the string off?"" he said, he knew nothing about it. My wife opened the box and missed the caps. He attempted to get out at the other door, but the porter prevented him, and in the scuffle his hat fell off, and I picked it up; it contained four caps and a handkerchief, which were taken out of the band box. My wife claimed them. I asked him for the string of the box, and he pulled it out of his pocket - he was dressed in livery. There was no time to secure him, as the coach would not wait. I went as far as the Elephant and Castle, inn. I saw the prisoner again on the 9th of October, and am certain of him - he was not in livery then. GEORGE FEARN . I am a porter at the Spread Eagle. I received the band box, and put it inside the coach, on the front seat - the prisoner was the only person in the coach; I am certain of him. After he was charged with taking the caps, he tried to get out at the other door, but I prevented him. Mr. Fisher agreed to go on in the coach, and he went on to Brighton, to his master, Mr. Barber Beaumont. I am certain he is the man.Prisoner's Defence.

I then had a sovereign and 16 s. 6 d., in silver - I gave the man 1 s. for beer, and while he was gone for it I fell sick, and laid down by the side of their bed. I awoke in a quarter of an hour, and they were fighting - I put my hand in my left hand pocket, and found I had only 8 1/2 d. left. I said they had behaved very ill to me in robbing me, and they had better give up my money. The man searched his wife, and found 2 s. 6 d. on her, and offered it to me to go away. I took the woman to the watch-house; he followed me there. I gave him in charge. He denied having any money - 17 s. was found on him. I lost a sovereign and 12 s. 6 d.Prisoner JOHN DAVIS . Q. When you got home your wife asked you for your money, and you gave her three sovereigns and 16 s. - A. Yes - she returned it to me again. I went home with a boy to King-street, Portman-square, and then returned to the prisoners'; but went to no public-houses after I left Chelsea. I was rather ill in my stomach. I had only drank two pots of beer, and very little gin. NOT GUILTY .Second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Common Sergeant.",notGuilty,none

Nothing was said about the knife till the patrol said Smith had offered him all the money he had. He then said he had threatened the woman with a knife; Smith did not deny offering the money.MURPHY'S Defence.

I said it was hard for me to pay it, but sooner than she should stop in trouble I would; I sent a person out to pawn something, and paid him; he said if he did not have 7 s. it would not do; he went to the top of the street, returned, and took the 5 s.; I told Summers who took it from him, and returned to me.

On the 18th of September (the day of Egham races), about half-past one o'clock, Fearby and Whitton came in a horse and gig, and dined at my house - they had often been there before, and had slept there once; they asked what time the races began, I told them half-past two o'clock - they went away about half-past three, and returned in the same gig, about half-past eight; it was dark then. The other three prisoners came in directly after, and there was a sixth man in their company (who gave the name of White at Kensington); there were ten in company altogether - they all appeared in company, one with the other, and went into the same room, and all appeared acquainted; they sat in the same room. Leicester came in a gig with White. When Fearby returned in the evening, I stood at the door - he told me to move his horse in the same position as a gentleman's, who was going away at the time, that it might not be exposed to the draft. The horses were kept outside in the gigs all the time they were there. The whole tenwere in the parlour on the ground floor - it is quite separate from the bar and tap room; nobody could see what passed in the parlour - the parlour door was open most all the time, for one of them observed that it was warm, and desired me to leave it ajar. There is a passage four or five feet wide, between the bar and parlour. I was in the parlour twice to wait on them, and was in and out of the bar and tap-room. They sat at the tables - there are two or three tables in the room, but no one large enough for them all to sit at. I could not see what they were about. Some of them had tea, some grog, and some pipes. I, my wife, and servant all went into the room occasionally, to wait on them. Some of them went out at times; Fearby was out once when I went into the room. The staircase comes into the passage, which the parlour door opens into; it fronts the street door, and that passage leads into the garden. One of the men who came in the fourth gig, and who is not here, while he stood in street asked me to shew him the way to the water-closet, which I did - it is in the garden; I unlocked the door for him. They talked as if they were all in one general company, and sang two songs. They staid about an hour - the horses and gigs staid outside all the time, close to each other; away from the principal entrance, towards the tap. I missed nothing before they left.Q. In what manner did they leave - A. After singing two songs, they all joined in the last chorus together. I stood in the tap-room, hearing it; I cannot say whether they were all in the tap-room at that time, for I was not in the room for a quarter of an hour before; but as soon as the song was sung, they were all off as quick as a shot out of a gun - they were out in a moment, and all into their gigs in a moment. Fearby and Whitton were the last who got into their gig. I advised them to stop a little, as there was danger from a waggon which was in the way. Whitton dropped 3 d. into my hand for the hostler, as he got into the gig, without waiting to have his horse reined up, as he usually did; he and Fearby got into the same gig - they came first and went last. Several of them went out of the room, while they were there. Fearby in particular walked up and down the passage, with his great coat and whip in his hand. In the course of ten minutes after they were gone, my wife alarmed me; I went up and found the bed-room door open - the lock had been picked - it was locked before. I found five or six boxes and the bureau all broken open, and marks of violence on them. I found a small bit of a polished steel instrument, which had been broken in the room. My papers were all on the bed, where one of my children was asleep. I missed the articles stated in the indictment. The handle of the punch ladle was broken off, and only the silver part taken. The value of the goods stolen was nearly 100 l., besides which three 5 l. Bank-notes, one 5 l. Abingdon note, sixteen sovereigns, a half-guinea and a 7 s. piece were taken. I sent my wife for an officer, who came. I and my hostler set off in my gig; the officer and his son and another went in his cart. We told the patrols on the road of the robbery, and when I came to Kensington, I found the five prisoners in custody, three of them in one house together, at the Marquis of Granby, that was Leicester, Fearby, Whitton, and White the two others were near the gateway of the palace, about thirty yards off, in a gig. There were four gigs in all came to my house, three persons were in one gig, and one on horseback - all four gigs set off towards London - I only came up with three gigs. At the time they were at my house, no persons were taking refreshment on the side of the house where they were, and where the stair-case is. I have found the three 5 l. Bank-notes at the Bank. White has escaped.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long was White in custody - A. I do not know; I left him in custody. I was there an hour; they went away in a great hurry. My house is on this side of the racecourse; it is nine miles from town; there are cross roads between me and town. The bar is between the passage and tap-room.Q. Cannot persons come into your passage out of the taproom - A. Certainly; the passage communicates with the staircase; but they must go through two kitchens to get to the passage from the taproom; but from the parlour they can get to the staircase. The passage runs right through the house, and there is another passage which leads into the bar and into the tap-room; but the general passage is where the staircase is; but it cannot be got to from the taproom, without going through the kitchens. No guests sit in the kitchens. The passage dividing the taproom from the bar, does not lead to the passage communicating with the staircase, except by going through the kitchens. There were plenty of people travelling up and down the road. The prisoners were in the room; we put the best company in; they sat at three tables, and kept us all in full employ. They called frequently for the attendants; and left a pint of ale unpaid, which was served to them when they first went in; they were off so quick I had no opportunity of mentioning it; neither of the prisoners called for the ale. When the parlour door is open I can see into it from the bar, the door was a-jar. There is no other staircase.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You have one common passage to your house - A. I have; one passage leads to the taproom, the principal passage leads to the staircase; at one end of that passage is the door leading to the street, any person standing at the door can see the bottom of the staircase, it is four or five yards from the staircase; any person can come from the street to the stairs, without going through any room. The parties arrived in four gigs; it was dark, I think they could not have got the property without a light. The bed-room is the back room, first floor, and looks into the stable yard; it has only one window, and the window cannot be seen in all parts of the yard; a candle in the room would not throw a light over all the yard, for the window is hid by a wall; the light would fall on the yard, except in one direction. Some of the prisoners came out and paid for what they had; I had only served two of them. White ordered the first glass of rum and water himself; it was not paid for; the man who came on horseback ordered ale - he is not here. Three men were in the last gig.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were much engaged with their orders - A. Yes; I did not go into the passage much myself, I was principally at the door to see if the horses were taken care of; I was in and out at the door, in the bar and tap-room, While I was at the door no person went in, so as to go up stairs. When the parlour door isopen, they could see into the bar; the bar door is right opposite the parlour door. Fearby and Whitton are the only persons I remember seeing before.COURT. Q. Does the passage which divides the taproom from the bar, communicate with the stable yard - A. No; they desired the gigs to be moved from the passage leading to the staircase, on account of the draft. There was three or four candles in the parlour; I did not miss any candle at any time. MARY CURTIS . I am wife of the last witness. On the evening in question, I remember all the prisoners being in the house. I was in the bed-room five minutes before they came into the house, my child was in bed there; I went to the box which contained some of the property, and took another box off it, every thing was then perfectly safe; I locked the door when I came out, tried it, and put the key in my pocket, and kept it till I went up and discovered the robbery; the articles stated in the indictment were in the room; the prisoners came in five minutes after I came down. Fearby came into the house by himself, and asked me for a glass of brandy and water, and a pipe - (He and Whitton had dined there) - I knew them both before; I did not see the others come in. I made the brandy and water, and took it into the parlour; Fearby and Leicester were then in there, and some more were coming in at the door, I did not notice them; I went into the parlour again in about ten minutes, with bread and butter; there were seven or eight there then; I can only swear to Leicester and Fearby, I did not observe Whitton at that time. I went into the room again, in about twenty minutes, some were drinking, some smoking, and others at tea then - it is common for people to call for different things if they are of one party; they gave orders at different times; the parlour door was open most of the time, I was to and fro in the parlour, and crossed the passage to go there. I was generally in the bar while they were there; nobody could come in at the front door and go up stairs, without passing the bar.Q. If any person went from the parlour door to the stairs, must you also see them - A. Yes, I cannot see the stair-case from the bar-door; I could see them come from the parlour-door, but could not see whether they went up stairs, as it is five or six yards from the bar. As I stand in the bar, my face is towards the street door, my right side towards the parlour, and my back towards the staircase. I remained down stairs till they all went away. No guests were in the house except the ten in the parlour. There were people in the tap-room, most of whom were there when we made the discovery; they could not come from the tap-room and pass the bar to the stairs without my seeing them. I saw three men go from the tap-room into the passage, and go up to bed while the prisoners were there; they were waggoners, whose waggons stood at our house - one of them had slept there for fifteen years. While the prisoners were there they kept walking about, and Fearby walked up and down the passage with his whip in his hand, and he brought me his glass to fill with brandy and water; he left the glass with me and went out of doors; my husband was in the bar at that time; my face is turned the same way when I mix liquors as at other times. I sent the servant up with the three men when they went to bed; that was half an hour before the party went away; they sleep on the second floor. I was present when the party went away; one did not pay. Whitton came to the bar to pay; that was the first time I had seen him; and Leicester came to the bar for a pipe. They went away all in a moment. I went to tell the gentleman on horseback that he had not paid his reckoning, and they were gone before I could get to the door - they were all moving off - I just saw the chaises. I went up to the bed-room in about five minutes; nobody had been in the house in the mean time. I found the lock of the bed-room door open, without any appearance of violence - it was half open. I had the key in my pocket. I found a mahogany box which had contained the property on the bed; the lock was broken off, and papers strewed about; another trunk and the bureau were broken open; my husband sent me for a constable, and set out in pursuit.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not state at Bow-street that it was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after they left that you went up - A. I said about ten minutes, but never mentioned a quarter of an hour; I cannot tell the exact time. We have lived a year and a quarter in the house. There is an inner door in the passage, between the bar and street doors - it is two or perhaps three yards from the bar; the stairs are about five yards from the bar; there is no window in the bar opposite the parlour; I can see through the bar door, but if I am mixing liquors I am away from it. I serve at the bar door.Q. Fearby first came into the bar - A. No. I met him in the passage at the inner door - he ordered a glass of liquor, and took it into the parlour to him in about five minutes; only he and Leicester were there then - they had not taken their seats. I met the others coming into the parlour as I came out. I went into the parlour again in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour with bread and butter. There was then seven or eight people there - I saw Curry and Raven drinking brandy and water at the same table as those who had tea. There might be six persons in the tap-room - none of them had come from the races. I was not in the tap-room while the prisoners were there, but was just before; there was then about six persons there, three of whom were the men who went up to bed. The passage leading to the tap is on one side of the bar, and is very narrow, and the passage to the parlour on the other side. A person coming through the taproom must go through two kitchens, to get to the parlour. They could get to the stairs without going through the bar, but not without our seeing them.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How many times did you go into the parlour - A. Three; a quarter of an hour might elapse between the first and second time, and in twenty minutes I went again, and then saw Raven and Curry - they sat drinking together and another person by their side - I do not know whether he was drinking with them. Raven came to the bar to ask for change for his 5 s. piece, just as he was going. We never put two parties into the parlour together, without asking if it would be agreeable. The tables are not used by different parties - we have seldom occasion for them. These races make very little difference to us. We have three or four rooms, and seldom put two parties into one, as they arenever all full at once. Some gentlemen had left the parlour just before they came in. I mixed liquors for nobody else while the party were in the parlour - I might mix a glass for the tap-room. The waggoners knew the house very well - they did not go to bed at the same time.MR. ADOLPHUS. When the property was missed, were the waggoners applied to - A. I went up stairs, they were all in bed - I did not examine their rooms - they staid till morning, and one came back in the evening. I believe two of them went away about three o'clock - I had not been to bed then. The gentlemen who were in the parlour before they came were there when I went up stairs - I went to fetch some Banbury cakes for them; they were not out of my sight afterward till they left. I only speak of time and distance by guess. JAMES HAMPTON . I am hostler at the house, and have been so nearly four years. I recollect all the five prisoners being at master's house on the 18th - I am sure of all their persons. Fearby and Whitton came in the morning, and came again in the evening with the others, and five more, about half-past eight o'clock; they all came within three minutes. Fearby and Whitton were in one gig; two more gigs had two in each, and another had three - one was on horseback - that was neither of the prisoners - they got out of their gigs, and walked in; I stood outside all the time taking care of the gigs and horses; they walked into the parlour - Fearby kept walking in and out several times, and he looked in at the bar window - he spoke to me - some of the others came in and out - I could see the passage from where I stood - nobody except that party went into that passage while they were there - Fearby and Whitton frequented the house - they went away about half-past nine in their gigs all together as quick as possibly they could - they appeared sober. I heard of the robbery soon after, and immediately went off with my master in a gig after them, and at Kensigton we found Fearby and Whitton in the Marquise of Granby, and some were in the next house - the prisoners and White were all stopped at Kensington - I found them in custody of the patrol when we came up.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was it not a very busy day - A. No. I think it was between three and four minutes after Fearby and Whitton came up that the rest came - it was not five minutes - the other three gigs came up as quick as they could, one after the other, at a pretty good pace - a man can drive half-a-mile in four minutes. Fearby came up and spoke to me about his horse - he had given directions about it when he first came. I had the hay in a crib at the door, and did not leave the door at all. I was in the tap-room when Fearby arrived and was called out - the gig had just pulled up - I did not see it come up. I left about half-a-dozen persons in the tap-room.Q. How do they get from the yard to the taproom - A. Out at the yard-gate. I can go into the tap-room from the street. I went into the tap-room after they were all gone - there were several persons there then - there were not so many as nine.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. I suppose while the gigs stood there many others drove by towards London - A. Yes; Curry and Raven were in the third gig. I did not move their gigs - if more had called at the house I should - Fearby's stood nearest to the door - they were all drawn up with their heads facing the bar-window, which is in front of the house - they were aside of each other - the crib was just by the tap-room window. I stood facing the passage, with my side to the bar-window. I am sure nobody went into the passage while they were there, or I must have seen them go in - there is a back way to the house through the yard. When I got to Kensington they had been stopped. Raven and Curry were not in the same house as Fearby and Whitton.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you hear any other gig come up when Fearby and Whitton's came - A. No; the other three came up close one after the other. I asked Fearby, If I should take his horse out of the gig? he said No. I made the same offer to all the others, and they said No. It was a darkish windy night, it did not rain; I could see the door of the house, all the time they were there nobody went in at the street door to the passage. Egham races makes very little difference to our business. The window of the parlour where they sat looks into the street; I did not see it open.MRS. CURTIS re-examined. There is only one window to the parlour that was closed. MARY SIMPSON . I am servant to Mr. Curtis, and remember the company coming into the parlour on the night of the robbery. I waited on them, there were ten of them, they were all in the parlour when I began to wait on them. Fearby and Whitton had brandy and water, they sat at a table with another man, who is not here, he was drinking something else; the other seven all had something. I was frequently in the room, and heard them all talking to one another; they sang while I was in the room, two of them sang, I do not recollect whether the rest did. Whitton came to the bar and paid the mistress as they were going away; and one, who is absent, gave me some money, which he wanted to change. Curry gave me 1 s. for two glasses of rum and water. Raven gave me a crown-piece for change which I gave mistress. Three waggoners slept in the garret that night, all in one room; I show-them up to bed all at one time, and left a candle with them. I went up to their room after the robbery was discovered - they were there then, and appeared to be asleep - their candle was put out. I did not notice my master's bed-room door when I lit them up. The ten men went away about half an hour after.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. If different parties came you would shew them into that room - A. Yes. If two or three parties came respectably dressed, I should shew them into that room. I went up with the waggoners all at once - (I think it was half an hour before the party went). If my master's bed-room door had been open then, I think I must have observed it - if there had been a light in the room I must. I went up to the waggoners' room about quarter of an hour after the men went away, I do not think it was more - I went up alone, to see if the men were in bed; nobody sent me up. My mistress went up before me.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Curry and Raven drank together, nobody drank with them - A. They were not talking to the people at the other tables, but with themselves. I have seen two or three different parties in that room together.MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you lived at the house - A. Three years. There are three rooms for company. We never put two parties into one room, unless the other rooms are occupied - there was nobody in the other rooms. I did not awake the waggoners - they went away in the morning at the regular time of their business. JOHN FINAL COOK . I am a constable. I went in pursuit with my son and a young man on this night. Mr. Curtis and his hostler followed. I first saw Curry and Raven opposite the Goat, public house, opposite the palace gates. The patrol had turned their gig round - he brought them to me - I took them out of the gig into the Goat, public-house, and assisted in searching them; but found none of the property. I left them in custody, and went to the Marquis of Granby, where two gigs stood, and there found Fearby, Leicester, Whitton, and one, who has escaped, (he gave the name of White); they were in the same room together, and the only persons in the room. I took them all into custody - one of them was coming towards the door; I insisted that none of them should go till they were searched. Fearby asked what authority I had; I said I was an officer, that there had been a robbery at a public-house, at Hounslow, and a hue and cry raised; they appeared rather to dispute my searching them. I found none of the property.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You saw two gigs at the door and the persons inside were drinking liquor there - A. Yes. I saw the gigs there as I went to the Goat, and on returning from the Goat, I found them in the road - I was going into the Marquis of Granby at first, but Staines said,""Here is one going on,"" and then I went and took Curry and Raven, and made all the haste I possibly could back to the Marquis of Granby, fearing the party should have heard what had passed. I saw nobody in the two gigs. I believe the hostler stood there. I was an hour and a half there, and left White and all in safe custody. I searched them all minutely.Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Curry and Raven were going towards London - A. Yes. I searched the gigs.MR. ADOLPHUS, Q. How long were you searching the two men before you went to the Marquis of Granby - A. Not five minutes. Curry's chaise had passed the other two before Staines turned it round. The heads of the other two horses were turned towards town. I was present when a watch was brought in.COURT. Q. You pursued as soon as you got information - A. Yes. I only caught sight of three gigs. I am deaf, and only understood Curtis that there were three - but he says he told me four. ISAAC STAINES . I am horse patrol at Hounslow. I went on horseback with Cook - and when I came to Kensington, saw three gigs standing at the Marquis of Granby, public-house; before I could get up, one separated from the other two - Curry and Raven were in that gig. I ran we took them to the Three Tuns, public house - searched up, stopped the gig, took them into custody - called Cook; them, but found nothing. I went back to the Marquis of Granby, in about five minutes - the two gigs still stood there. I followed Cook through the bar into the parlour, and found Fearby, Leicester, Whitton, and White, there. I did not know any of them before - we secured and searched them, but found nothing. Cook told them, we took them for robbing the White Lion, public-house, at Hounslow, where they had been before. Fearby said, he considered we were officers, and was very willing to be searched. We went back from there to the other prisoners, at the Three Tuns, and there a gentleman gave me a watch. Curtis does not claim it.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How far beyond the Marquis of Granby did you get, before you turned the gig back - A. About one hundred yards. I hollowed out to Cook, who was nearly opposite the Marquis of Granby; he came to me. He is deaf - but he had others with him.Q. Any person on the watch could have given the alarm - A. Yes, but the prisoners were in the parlour, at the back of the bar, and at the back of the house.FEARBY'S Defence. The road between Hounslow and Kensington, is so interspersed with cross-roads, that nothing would be more natural for me, (if I had committed the robbery), than to have gone out of the regular road, much less would it be likely for me to have stopped half an hour, with my horse and gig, at the Marquis of Granby. I was minutely searched; the bar-room I was in, and my gig were also searched. I was not kept in confinement, but kept that night in the public-house. After four hours, the officer said one man had escaped; the door was open, and I might have gone out as well. I dined at the house that day - and when we left, two persons were in the parlour, and had been for half an hour. In the evening, I went out to see if my horse and gig were safe, and ordered a glass of rum and water. We had some conversation respecting the races. Mrs. Curtis asked, if there were many people there; I said Yes. She said she thought so, as so many people had come to her house. Several more people came in, and a song was sung, and many joined in the chorus - it is said there were ten people in the room, but I think there were many more. He says one of the three men has slept at the house, fifteen years; how can he be so positive, when he has only been there a year and a half? It is plain they do not know when the robbery was done, or they would not have searched the waggoners. The house is exposed to every passenger, situated directly on the main road to the West of England - and particularly on that day when there was a prize fight, as well as the races. How easily might any person in the tap room have gone into the parlour, without the knowledge of any of the witnesses? the parlour door was wide open.The other prisoners made no defence.FEARBY - GUILTY - DEATH .

ROBERT BRYAN . I am in partnership with Henry Price , we live in Great Chapel-street, Westminster; and are army accoutrement makers. The prisoner was in our service; he made our brass ornaments. On the 7th of October, in consequence of information from Atkins, I and an officer watched the prisoner about quarter past one o'clock, from Atkins's house, in Cecil-court, into Hawkes, Mosley, and Co's., Piccadilly, army accoutrement makers. I went in about five minutes, and found him offering three gross of buttons for sale, which were ours. I asked what he did there? he said, he only came with Atkins. I said,""I suspect you have been robbing me of buttons - these are mine;"" he said,""They were Atkins's."" Atkins (who was with him) said,""They are not, you want to get me transported as well as yourself;"" he then said he had bought the metal and made them, and that Mr. Mosley had ordered twelve gross. Mr. Mosley came down and said, he had never seen him in his life; and had ordered none. I gave him in charge. We took stock a week ago, and found we were five gross deficient. They came out of our die, and are our metal; and it is impossible he could make them from his own metal. WILLIAM ATKINS . I was a burnisher, in the prosecutor's employment, four or five months ago. The prisoner came to me five or six weeks ago, and said he had an order from Hawkes, Mosley, and Co. for twelve gross of buttons, and wanted me to burnish them for him. He came to me on the morning of the 7th of October, about half-past eight o'clock, and left five gross to burnish, and said if I would do them by two o'clock we could go and sell them, for I knew the shop better than he did; I suspected him, and informed Mr. Bryan, as I knew his die. Mr. Bryan told me to burnish as many as I could by the time, and I did three gross. The prisoner called, and I set him to count them while I went out and told Mr. Bryan he was come. I returned - he said,""Here, you take them; I'll have no more to do with them."" I said, I would have nothing to do with them; they were tied up, and we went to Hawkes's, and at the door he said,""You go in with them;"" I said,""No; I'll go in with you."" He went in and offered them for sale to the clerk, at 3 s. a gross; he had told me he would take 2 s. Bryan came in and took him.(Property produced and sworn to.) WILLIAM RAY . I am clerk to Messrs. Hawkes and Co.; the prisoner came and produced three gross of buttons, at 3 s.; and said he came from Birmingham, and could make them as cheap as any body.Prisoner's Defence.

I am a milkman, and live in Fleur-de-lis-court, Spitalfields. On the 12th of September, I was in the Kingsland-road, and heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw people pursuing the prisoner. I followed, and tried to stop him - but he got from me. I followed and seized him by Kingsland-road, about seven houses from where I first saw him. Just as I took him he put his hand into his pocket, and whipped the spoon out over a wall, and said,""What are you taking hold of me for, I have got nothing"" - I said,""No, you have thrown it out of your pocket."" He said he did not take the spoon, but another boy had; I took him to Davis's, the King's Head, public-house, and left him there.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you mean to say he mentioned the word""spoon"" - A. He said another boy took the spoon. I stopped him about two hundred yards from the public-house. I told Cox where he had thrown it. SOPHIA DAVIS . I am the wife of Thomas Davis - we keep a public-house in the Kingsland-road. The prisoner was in the tap-room about quarter past one o'clock, with others - they staid about ten minutes, and in consequence of what was said, I looked, and missed a spoon of the table - I ran in pursuit of the prisoner, who had left the house just before. I saw him running, and pursued him calling Stop thief!Cross-examined. Q. How many were in the house - A. I cannot say. Some were much older than him. I think one went out with him.

I intended to brew, and saw him at Mr. Pratt's, a sugar refiner, where he is foreman. I asked him to give me instructions to brew - he did - but said he was going to brew himself next week, and if I would send him hops and malt he would brew for me. I said""It will be useless my sending hops and malt; if you'll buy them for me when you buy your own, I will pay you for them."" He always told me he was a partner in the house, and it was generally believed in the neighbourhood. I sent a message to him, and received a cask of beer and ale from him, and paid him 16 s., which he said was for two bushels of malt and two pounds of hops.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS.

In consequence of the rain coming through the roof, on the 24th of October, I went on the roof the house, the prisoner followed me up of his own accord; I found the lead cut from all round the building - it measured an hundred and thirty-five feet; three quarters of it had been taken away, and the rest rolled up ready for being carried away; the lead which covered the trap-door appeared to have been removed for some time. On returning with the prisoner, I said it was most surprising how it could be cut without his knowing something of it; he said he cut some of it to mend other parts, and that I told him to do it, which was false. About eight o'clock in the evening I went up with a dark lantern, and found some sheet lead folded and laid on the rafters; that was done since I had been there; and in the morning I found the prisoner's basket with a quantity of lead folded up on it.Prisoner. Q. Was not that place free of access to every body - A. There are two separate parts of the building, and the porter at the gate is ordered to admit no one. It is impossible for any body to get on the roof; a female pauper was found there six months ago, when a ladder had been left there. Three pieces of the lead were in his basket. ELIZABETH THATCHER . I am a pauper in the house. On the 24th of October, the rain came in at the roof. I lifted up the window, and called out,""Bill, what makesthe wet come in?"" I did not see him, or have any answer.

A little time after, he came up into the ward; I pointed to where the rain came in, and said,""How did you make this wet come in?""

GEORGE CALFORD . I am employed by James Weale , Joseph Carlton , and Charles Ward , to take care of a warehouse where furniture is let out, at No. 11, Edward-street, Portman-square. I live in Upper Brook-street, Grosvenor-square. On one Sunday I called at the warehouse, and, in consequence of what passed, I went to No. 2, Park-street, Grosvenor-square, and inquired for Thomas Berry ; I did not see him; it was a very good house, fit for a gentleman. I saw a person there, who represented himself as his housekeeper; and, in consequence of what passed between her and myself, I was perfectly satisfied, and sent the goods stated in the indictment to the house, with an inventory of them, and the terms of hire per week, which was 10 s. 6 d.; they were delivered on the 8th October, 1821; I had not then seen Mr. Berry; on the following Monday the week expired, and the housekeeper brought back a pair of sheets and pillowcases, and paid 10 s. 6 d. for the week's hire. In the afternoon an order was sent for six more tablespoons for one night's use, which I sent without a list; and about three days after I sent the porter for the spoons; he did not bring them, nor have I seen them since. Five or six weeks after, not having received any more money, and hearing something, I applied for the arrears, and saw a person who I understood to be Mrs. Berry; I got neither goods or money from her. A few days after I called again, and saw the servant. I went several times until the 21st of December, when I was determined not to leave till I got satisfied. I was in the house about an hour and a-half, and while there, the prisoner came in, the servant said to him,""I am glad you are come, Sir, for this man has been very insolent, and refuses to leave the house;"" he walked up into the drawing-room with me. I said, Mr. Berry, I have come for the goods which you have belonging to my master; and out of the house I cannot go without the goods or the hire."" I told him where I came from, and shewed him the list of the goods; he said his wife was in the country - she had the property locked up, and that on Saturday on her return they should be given up, and the hire paid. I left very dissatisfied, and said I would not quit the house; he then took out his pocket-book, and shewed ten or twelve bills of exchange to the amount of about 2000 l. He picked out one for 150 l., which he said was the smallest, and I was to hold it as security until the following Saturday, when he would return the goods, and I left (the bill was here produced, dated 1st November, 1821, upon John May , Trinity-square, Aldersgate-street, by Thomas Cates , accepted, due the 4th of September, 1822, and endorsed by the drawer.) There was pen and ink there; but I said he should not endorse it, as I should not put it into circulation. On the Saturday I called several times, but could not see him. I never saw him again till 3d October, 1822, when he was in custody; I never afterwards found any body at the house but one maid-servant; I saw his wife afterwards in Clerkenwell prison. When the bill became due, I presented it at No. 6, Trinity-court; there is no Trinity-square, there was no number on the bill; I found a John May lodged in a garret at No. 6, Trinity-court; I did not see him, but his wife; I was not paid; I could find no other John May ; I found the prisoner, in October, at a furnished-house, No. 42, Edgware-road, of which he appeared master; I got an officer, and took him; he denied having seen me before, and repeated that before the Magistrate; I at last produced the bill; he then faultered, and said he believed he had seen me once before, but persisted that he had never received the goods. He did not ask me for the 150 l. bill; I saw him searched; 4 1/2 d. was found on him, and an old gilt chain without a watch. I have recovered none of the goods.Prisoner. Q. When you called, did I not say I knew nothing of the goods. A. No; he said his wife had them locked up. DAVID VERNON . I was porter at the warehouse in October, 1821. I delivered the goods at No. 2, Park-street, with a bill of them. I went on the Monday following, with six tablespoons - I took no account with them; they were never returned to me. I went for them once. I never saw the prisoner. MICHAEL MORRIS . I am an officer. I apprehended him by Calford's direction; he said he never saw Calford - that he heard of the name - but knew nothing of the business; he sneered at it ANN SAWYER . I am proprietor of the furnished house, No. 2, Park-street, Grosvenor-square. On the 3d of October, I let it to Mr. and Mrs. Berry, for the year, at 190 l. The prisoner said they came from Worcester, and they could only give reference to two houses in the city; they referred me to Bull and Brooksbank, No. 5, Adam's-court, at the back of the Bank - who the prisoner said were their agents, and said he was a gentleman coming to reside in town with his aunt. I went to Bull and Co., who gavehim a very excellent character. I never got a quarter's rent, and could hear no more of Bull and Co. Calford applied to me; I gave him information. They went from my house, a little before the quarter was due, all but the maid-servant. On my coming in, she said she had received a letter from Mrs. Berry, to meet her in Portman-square. I sent a person with her to meet her mistress, but she ran away.Prisoner's Defence. I never had the goods, or saw them - and Mrs. Berry says she never ordered them, nor ever paid any thing for the hire of any thing in the house. GUILTY . Aged 38.

I went into a chandler's shop with her, got some bread and butter, and went to her house, No. 38, Spring-street. I had come ashore the day before, and received 10 l. 18 s. 4 d. for wages, it was in five sovereigns, and a 5 l. note. I changed the note; I had five sovereigns, and some silver in my waistcoat pocket. I sat on the foot of the bed, while she lit the fire; we were on the ground-floor. I had been up all night and fell asleep; only herself and I were in the room. Smith awoke me just about dusk. I did not know him before; it was dark - and I do not know whether Dowling was there. Then Smith asked what business I had there? and who brought me there? I felt in my waistcoat pocket, when he awoke me - and I told him a girl brought me there, and that I should not go till an officer came, for I had been robbed. Another man came in with a light, and gave me some beer. I drank with them, because I was very thirsty. Then the prisoner and the man took me by the arm, and turned me out of the room. I stood outside the door, till the watch was set. I told him, and he told me to fetch an officer. I got Spooner, who went in, and found the prisoners in bed together. ANN GARBATT . I keep a public-house in Fox-lane, Shadwell. Dowling came to me between one and two o'clock, on the 29th of September, for a pot of beer, and asked me to change a sovereign - which I did. She lived at No. 38, Spring-street; she took the beer away. I had seen Boyer following her, about half past twelve o'clock, that morning - he was very drunk then. When she came to me, she said a friend who had come from sea, and whom she had known seven or eight years, had given her some money to buy a bonnet and some other things. She left four sovereigns with me, besides the one she changed. She wished me to keep it for her, as she thought she might lose it. She afterwards came for silver for one of the sovereigns, saying, she wanted to pay her landlord, and that she had been paying other debts about the neighbourhood. I sent for Spooner at night, and gave him the money. Smith lives at the house; he is a hard-working man. EDWARD ALLEN . I am a watchman.

LAW conducted the prosecution. WILLIAM BECKETT (being questioned, appeared perfectly to understand the nature of an oath.) I am eleven years old, and live at Heston, with Mr. Bell. About two or three months ago, in the harvest time. I met the prisoner at Windmill-bridge - he wanted me to let him shoot at my hat; I refused; he took it off my head, and threw it up in the air - it lodged in a hedge, and he shot two holes in it, and after that he went to the other side of the road and picked up some pebbles-stones, and said,""I'll be d - d if I don't have a shoot at you;"" I said, "" Oh! Ah!"" and when he picked up the stones and crossed the road, he said,""Do you think I should hit you there?"" I said, Oh! Ah! He put the gun up to his shoulder, and put his fingers to the trigger - I put my hands to my face, and he fired off directly; I saw the flash - it hit me is the hands, arms, and face, and in my eye, in consequence ofwhich, I have lost the sight of it. Some of the stones were as big as peas. There was not room for more then two carts to pass between us when he fired. I had no quarrell with him. I never saw him before. When he saw I was wounded, he went and told Mr. Coleman that his gun had gone off, and he had shot this little boy in the face. Mr. Coleman said,""Take him down to the canal, and wipe his face,"" which he did, and rubbed it with brown paper, and took me through the field towards home. He then asked which was my way home - I pointed to it, and he left me to go home; I walked back towards the bridge, and saw no more of him.Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. How long had you been in his company - A. About half an hour. He was put there to keep the birds off the barley. I had been talking to him. There were some boats near us with people in them when he fired - they were at the lock below the bridge.COURT. Q. Had he fired his gun before he fired at your hat - A. I did not see him fire before - it was loaded before he shot at my hat. His powder was in a bag in his pocket I - saw him pick up pebbles and put into the gun, and ram ti down after the pebbles were put in. I said Oh! Ah! thinking he was only in fun - I did not think he was going to shoot me. I could have ran away or stooped down if I liked. I did not go before the Justice till about three weeks ago.PRESS BELL. The prosecutor lived with me. On the 17th after the accident, he came to my house. I saw him about half-past ten o'clock that night; he was in a dreadful state, and was under the doctor's care ten weeks. I went to a Magistrate about it next day.Cross-examined. Q. When did you go to Bow-street - A. About the 16th of November. I know Mr. Haydon - I told him if the prisoner discharged the doctor's bill, and paid the expences my wife had been at, I should not trouble him further. The boy was entirely under my care.MR. FROGLEY. I am a surgeon, and attended the prosecutor nine or ten weeks. I saw him the morning after the accident, and found him much wounded from the effects of it. I took several stones from his face, and some from under the skin of his hand. I expected he would have lost both eyes, but he has the sight of one. Some of the stones were very small; the largest was not bigger then a pea. He was unable to leave the house for six weeks. There was danger from the number of the wounds - he was out of danger after six weeks.Prisoner's Defence. It was an accident. I had the gun in my hand, and was going away from the boy, and getting over a stile - the but-end of the gun knocked against it and it went off. He called out; I ran and picked him up. I saw Coleman and told him of the accident, and went and washed him and wiped it with some paper, having no handkerchief.- TRUMPER. I am a farmer. The prisoner was in my service - I set him to keep the crows of the wheat. It was an old gun, and went off very easy at full cock - it was pretty strong at half-cock. I gave him one charge of shot in the morning in a hurry. He was not to shoot the birds, only to make a noise to frighten them away. He was a humane boy, and particularly fond of children. WILLIAM COLEMAN , JUN. I work on the canal, and was about fifteen yards from Beckett, in a boat, rather under the bridge when the gun went off - I could not see him; he hollowed,""Oh, my eye."" I got out of the boat and met him on the bridge. The prisoner was about five yards from me. Beckett said,""Take me home, or this boy will kill me."" I went away and did not see him washed. THOMAS COLEMAN . I was on the tow path of the canal, about fifty feet from the boys. I heard the gun go off, and immediately heard the boy cry. I sent my son on the bridge and went myself. The prisoner brought Beckett towards me, and said his gun had gone off unawares, and he had hurt the boy's face - he lifted him up to shew me his face. I lifted him over, and he washed him very carefully, and neither of us having a handkerchief, he poured the water on his face with his hands. He was very attentive to him, and appeared sorry.

I traced footsteps of two persons from the house, and also four resting places. I traced them towards Druce's house, and sat up all night watching, and on Friday morning I saw his cart, which Barnes stopped. I afterwards took Ings and one Jordan. I saw some lead in possession of Atkins, and found the rest buried in Drnce's garden. There were between 3 and 4 cwt of lead, it fitted with the top of the building; the whole was stripped off. I have no doubt it came from this building. THOMAS BARNES . I am a carpenter. On Tuesday, I stopped Druce with his cart. I was with Chapman on the 24th; we traced footsteps 200 yards from his house, until we came to the turnpike road. When I saw Druce with his cart, I told him I was directed to stop him; he asked me for what, I said on suspicion of the lead in his cart; he said he had some lead, but he did not know where it came from, that Jordan and Ings were to meet him at the Maidenhead, Battle-bridge, to take the lead from him.

Ings had said there was some lead in the gutters which might be got at; I said very well - he said, but we must have a ladder to get at it, and that he had been round the premises, and seen one laying there. He said nothing about it to Druce, but said to us on the Saturday night, that I must give him a good load of something before Christmas. Ings and I went to the house that night between eleven and twelve; Druce did not go. We took all the lead off the three gutters; it was about 7 cwt. We carried part at a time down in the meadow field which leads down to Druce's house; we then carried it on further, resting at times, and took it to Druce's house; he was at home; Ings went round to his windows, where he slept, and knocked; I saw him give out the shovel to dig a hole to bury it in the garden. I did not hear him say any thing. We buried it all in the garden. Ings went home, and I slept with Druce. (I lodge at the Swan.) I told Druce where we got it from, and what we had done with it. Ings and I met that day at Druce's house, and it was agreed that Druce should take it home on Monday morning, and we was to assist him in loading it; but we overslept ourselves, and did not go to Druce's on Monday, so it was not taken away. I was at the Swan on Sunday night; Druce was not there. On Tuesday morning I went to Druce's house between four and five o'clock - Ings did not come - Druce was up, and had a fire; and after having some tea, he said, "" the harness is on the donkey, you can getsome of the lead out of the garden.""

No. 5, Wilson-street, Bristol, it is my writing.Cross-examined by Mr. SERGEANT PELL. Q. Have you any distinct recollection of all the facts to which you have spoken to, or are you speaking under some degree of uncertainty - A. I speak from the letters; I recollect the application to the Bank for the power and so on. It is by looking at the letters that I speak with positiveness. I transact a good deal of business, but am not employed to obtain many powers of attorney; I supply the broker with what he wants to buy or sell; I recollect obtaining the power from the Bank, which I sent to Bristol, whether the one I sent was returned to me I cannot swear. I sent it by post, most likely I did not put the letter into the post myself. Mr. Wait is a stranger to me, I am certain the power of Attorney produced is that I received from Bristol, for my writing is at the back of it. I cannot swear that I received it on the 17th of September, as I might misdate it. I applied at the Bank, to act upon it myself.Mr. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. When you applied to obtain it in 1821, what did you do at the Bank - A. I wrote instructions for it on paper, which I put on the box, which is in the usual mode, (looking at a paper,) these are the instructions I delivered at the Bank, on the 24th of September 1821, and in consequence of which I got the power and forwarded it to Bristol. FRANCIS FIELD re-examined. (Looking at the instructions and power,) I filled up this power of attorney from this ticket of instruction, on the 24th of September 1821. There is a memorandum on the power, which enables me to speak to the date. I have no recollection of filling up any other of the same sort on that day. I know the power by the figures on it; a folio of the account from which it is taken is put on the instructions; and if I had made out two from the same account, they would have that folio. We make a memorandum on the account of having made a power. If a second application was made to me for a power to sell the same stock, I should object to it, if I recollected it. It would entirely depend upon my recollection.MR. UNDERHILL re-examined. I do not recollect that I received instructions for more than one power of attorney for this stock. WILLIAM DRURY . I live at Birmingham; I went into Mr. Wait's service on the 26th of June 1818, and left him the latter end of May, 1819. He was a grocer. I was in the habit of seeing him write. (Looks at a letter, dated 16th September, 1822.) I believe this to correspond with his writing - I believe it to be his writing. (Looking at another, dated 23d September, 1821.) I believe this to be his, but I cannot say so much for this as the first.Cross-examined by MR. SERJEANT PELL. Q. You are carrying on business on your own account new? - A. No; I am assistant at a grocer and cheese-factor's. I was never in Bristol. I became acquainted with Mr. Wait at Birmingham; he left some time after I left him. The last I knew of him was in May 1819, he carried on business at Birmingham as grocer; my business was to serve behind the counter: he had two assistants besides me, and a porter. Robert Sherlock was one. I do not recollect the other; he was also employed behind the counter. I did not keep the books; I have written in them occasionally; he kept the books himself. I can speak with greater certainty to one letter than the other.Q. Do you believe the whole of both the letters to be the hand-writing of Mr. Wait - A. Yes. I look to the signatures. I believe the body of both to be his writing.Q. Are not the characters of the two very unlike each other - A. Not very. My belief is formed more upon the signatures. There is a likeness in the bodies.Q. What occasioned you to leave Mr. Wait - I don't exactly know. I don't recollect any dispute with him, it is so long ago. He dismissed me - I inquired the reason, he would not give me a satisfactory one. I cannot exactly recollect what reason he assigned; I have no recollection that he gave any reason.MR. BOLLAND. Q. While you were with him, how many opportunities had you of seeing him write - A. I was in the habit of seeing him write most days; he has made out invoices to the customers.Q. In the body of one of the letters his name is set out, what is your belief as to that - A. I believe it to be his writing. ROBERT SHERLOCK . I live at Birmingham. I was in Mr. Wait's service eight or nine months; I left before Drury. I had opportunities of learning the character of his hand-writing (looking at the letters;) they appear to correspond with Mr. Wait's hand-writing; but that dated 16th September, 1822, corresponds more than the other.Cross-examined by MR. CAMPBELL. Q. You do not think the signatures of both to be so much like his - A. The signatures of both correspond more than the body; the signature of that dated 1821, corresponds more than the body. I think the whole of both are his writing, but one is more like it than the other.Q. Does it appear disguised at all - A. It does not correspond so much. I was principally behind the counter, and went out collecting a little.Q. How came you to leave him - A. I gave him notice; I had no dispute in particular.Q. On your solemn oath, had you any dispute with him before you left - A. I never had any particular dispute. He was rather afflicted at times.Q. Was any charge made against you of any thing that happened during his illness - I do not recollect any thing particular; I cannot recollect when it was, but I was behind the counter, and had taken a note, and Mr. Wait said he had looked into the drawer at night, and it was not there; but it was on the following morning, I do not recollect how long it was before I left. When I left him, I went to live with Mr. Bishop. Mr. Wait wished me to continue if I chose, and offered to get me a situation at Worcester, but I preferred going to Mr. Bishop. I have since been in business as a tobacconist at Birmingham, for two or three months, and then came to live in London.Q. You ran away from Birmingham - A. I had an error with the Excise, and left in consequence of that, but returned again, and settled the fine with the Excise.Mr. BOLLAND. Q. What was this transaction of the note - A. It was a local note payable some distance from Birmingham. I took it of a customer, Mr. Wait recollected my taking it and looked into the till at night, and said it was not there, and on the following morning he went to look and said he had found it there, this was cleared up and he wanted me to continue with him if Ichoose; he had said nothing to me about the note till he found it in the till, and after that he wished me to continue and gave me a character to Mr. Bishop.COURT. Q. How soon after you took the note did you put it into the till - A. Immediately that I took it, that I swear, he said nothing to me about it till morning, I had no quarrel with him except about this.Mr. JOHN HALL . I am a glass-merchant at Bristol, and have known Mr. Wait, forty or fifty years. In the the spring of 1821, he called on me to ask the name of my broker, it was about a year and three quarters ago; to the best of my recollection, he said he had twelve or fourteen hundred pounds of stock to sell; I understood him to say, it stood in the joint names of himself and another person whom he named. I don't recollect the name, but am certain it was not Cox, I recommended Mr. Underhill, to him. Mr. Wait lived in Bristol, but I don't exactly know where.Cross-examined. Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. What character has he born during the whole of his life - A. Very good, I never heard any thing amiss of him. WILLIAM SHEPPARD . I am a stationer, and live in Corn-street, Bristol. I know the prisoner, he has lived in Bristol during the last year, in two or three different streets. I never called on him, in Wilson-street, but understand he lived there. At the latter end of the year 1821 he came to me about witnessing his name to a power of Attorney, (looking at it,) this is it; he came into the shop, and asked me to witness his name to the power of Attorney, and having my pen in my hand, he asked me to fill up the blanks left for the date in the deed. I wrote""22d. October"" He requested I would write in the attestation; he dictated to me what to write.""The above named John Wait ."" (The words signed, sealed, and delivered were printed.) I don't recollect writing any more; I saw him sign the deed, no body else signed it. I don't know John Cox . Only myself and Mr. Davis, who lives opposite me were present. Mr. Davis was either in the shop or was sent for, he witnessed it as well as me, and it was returned to Mr. Wait, who took it away. I did not see it again till I saw it before the Magistrate.Cross-examined by MR. SERJEANT PELL. Q. I see it says""signed, sealed, and delivered, & c. in the presence of us, by the above named John Wait , and John Cox "" - A. I remember writing"" John Wait ,"" but have no recollection whatever of writing John Cox .Q. Can you take upon yourself to say positively you did not write John Cox (in the attestation) as well as John Wait - A. I do not think I could, I do not believe I did, I have no recollection of it. I believe Mr. Davis was there all the time; he and the prisoner both left the shop together. There may be a relation of the prisoner's at Bristol named John Wait . I am not acquainted with him. I have heard of a John Waite ten years ago at Bristol, but not since. I believe he lived at Kingsdown.Q. Did you not state before the magistrate that you believed the words John Cox were your writing, though you had no recollection of writing them - A. I do not think I could. I do not believe I did. I do not recollect writing it at all.Mr. BOLLAND. Q. You do not recollect writing the words at that time, did you ever see the deed afterwards to write them - A. Never till I saw it before the magistrate.COURT. Q. Do you believe"" John Cox "" to be your hand writing - A. It is very like it, but I do not believe it to be mine. I never saw any John Cox execute the deed, nor did I ever see Cox till he was pointed out to me before the magistrate. THOMAS DAVIS . I am an auctioneer, and live in Corn-street, Bristol, opposite Mr. Sheppard (looking at the attestation to the deed), here is my writing. I attested this instrument in Sheppard's shop; the prisoner was there. I saw Mr. Wait execute it; no John Cox was there. I know nobody of that name. I never saw any one of that name respecting this instrument.Q. Look at the attestation, can you say in what state it was at the time you signed your name to it - A.""The above named John Wait and John Cox "" is now written under it, but to the best of my belief only the whole of the line was there, or that the name of John Cox was not there, because I believe it impossible I could have written my name without seeing the writing, and if I had seen it in its present state, I should have known it to be wrong, the name John Cox was certainly not there at the time I signed it. After the instrument was executed, it was delivered to the prisoner. I never saw it again till I was examined about it.Cross-examined by Mr. CAMPBELL. Q. If I understand you, you now speak reasoning from probability, and not from any distinct recollection of the fact - A. I do, I reason from the instrument. The transaction never came across my mind afterwards.COURT. Q. Have you any recollection whether the name of John Cox opposite the seal was on it at the time - A. It could not be, or I should not have signed my name, I suppose for the same reason that neither of the names John Cox were there. WILLIAM SHEPPARD . I saw the prisoner sign his name opposite the seal. I have a distinct recollection that the name"" John Cox "" opposite the seal was not written at that time.Mr. JOHN COX . I am a solicitor, and live at Wrington in Somersetshire, about twelve miles from Bristol: there is no other solicitor of my name there. I produce the prohat of the will of John Fitcho , who bequeaths 2000 l. in trust to his widow, the interest was to go to the widow, and at her decease to me and my brother. Mr. Wait and Mr. Nash were appointed trustees: Nash never acted, and this was communicated to Mr. Wait, and in consequence of which I and him went in October 1815, to the Castle Bank, Bristol, to invest the stock. I mentioned in Mr. Wait's presence to Mr. Courtney the banker that Mr. Wait wished to invest this sum in the three per cent. consols, there being a deficiency of assets, the money did not amount to 2000 l. I told Mr. Courtney that Nash declined to act. that Mrs. Fitcho was likely to live many years, and as the money came ultimately to my brother and myself, and as Mr. Wait was the only gentleman named, we might all die before the old lady, and as the money might come to my brother's children, there should be another trustee. Mr. Courtney suggested to me to put my name in the stock, I said if Wait had no objection I would; and the stock was purchased in our joint names, no other stock was bought in our joint names (looking at the power of attorney). I never gave any body authority to obtain a power of attorney for the sale ofthe sock. The name John Cox is not my writing. I gave he bank notice to that effect (looking at the notice), this is my hand writing.Cross-examined by SERJEANT PELL. Q. Have you been much acquainted with Mr. Wait - A. I cannot say I have, except as being trustee to the will. I always understood him to be a very respectable man indeed. I saw the power of attorney at Wrington, on the 25th of September of this year. Mr. Day, the magistrate's clerk produced it to me there.Q. Have you a distinct recollection as to the state it was then in - A. I have.Q. Look at the signature John Cox to the execution, and tell me whether the word""Cox"" is in the same state now as when you saw it at Wrington - A. No, it is not, the letter C was then of a different character to what it is now, it was the same shape as a small c is usually made, with a dot, it has now a loop added to it. The dot is still visible, and the bottom of the C passed immediately into the o without a turn to it, but now there is a complete turn.Q. Is not your usual mode of writing your name with a C of a similar description to what this now is - A. Yes, Mr. Day gave the instrument into my hands, it was with me an hour. I had it repeatedly in my hands during that time, when I returned it; the C was in the same state as at first. I stated to several people that it was no imitation of my hand-writing, as the C was of a different character, and it was very remarkable that the C in the attestation and in the execution was of the same character. It is clear that the fine stroke in the C has been written since, for there is the appearance of two strokes where it joins the dot; there has been an attempt to make it, and the first stroke did not meet the dot in the regular form, and so a second is made.COURT. Q. Have you ever received a dividend on the stock yourself - A. Never. I very seldom receive dividends on any stocks. I have executed powers. WILLIAM COX . I live at Penley near Bristol, and am in the pilot service. In the beginning of October a person hired my boat to go to Clovelly, about eighteen miles from Bristol, on the coast of Devon, to bring a gentleman, and put him on board the brig Aurora. I got to Clovelly on Friday evening, the 4th of October. I found the prisoner there; he came on board. I had no conversation with him. I was only in the boat two days. The person who hired us told us he was going on board the Aurora, which I knew was bound for Philadelphia. We ran up the Canif on the Welch coast out of the bad weather to wait till the brig came down. I asked him no questions, nor did any body in my hearing. I came away on Sunday night, leaving him on board the vessel. THOMAS EVANS . I am a police officer; in consequence of information, I went down the river on the nights of the 8th and 9th of October; and in the Roads I found the gentleman at the bar in a small skiff down below, a man and a boy were on deck. I told him I had a warrant against him; he said how did I know he was there. I did not shew him the warrant, or tell him what it was for. I have known him twenty years; he lived in Wilson-street, I believe. I never saw him there, but I went to No. 5 Wilson-street, and saw his wife and family there.Cross-examined by MR. CAMPBELL. Q. Did you know- any other person of the name of Wait, at Bristol - A. Several, I know no John Wait , I do not know their Christian names. JAMES BRINDLE . I am in the service of the Post-office, at Bristol, and deliver letters in Wilson-street. The prisoner lived at No. 5, in September last, he has not lived there above two years (looking at the letter from Mr. Undrill to Mr. Wait) this has the regular London post mark on it. I have no recollection of this particular letter going through my hands.The several documents referred to were here read as under:5, Wilson-street, Bristol, 23d Sept. 1822.No. I. - SIR, I am recommended by Mr. John Hall, of this city, glazier, to employ you to buy and sell stock for me, as occasion may require. I wish you to send me a power of attorney for the sale of 2189 l. 17 s. 1 d. standing in the names of John Wait and John Cox , of Wrington, Somersetshire, attorney.Yours, &c. JOHN WAIT .To Mr. J. Underhill, broker, Stock Exchange, London.No. 2. - SIR, Enclosed you have the power executed, it was signed as far back as October, which I suppose makes no difference. We did not want the money then, therefore have let it remain till now. Please to sell out, and if possible, let me have it by return of post. - Yours, &c. JOHN WAIT .5, Wilson-street, Bristol, 16th Sept. 1822.No. 3. - SIR, In consequence of the very great difference in the signature of Mr. Cox, the Bank will not allow the power to pass, consequently, you will request Mr. Cox to address a letter, directed to the Accountant General, of the Bank of England, stating that he does not always sign in the same way, and authorizing the sale of the stock.In your letter you do not state in what way I shall send the proceeds. Our usual method is, by a Bank post bill.Yours, & c. J. UNDERHILL.Stock Exchange, Sept. 17, 1822. JOHN WAIT , ESQ. No. 5, Wilson-street, Bristol.A notice from Mr. Cox to the Bank of England, of the deed not being genuine, and the deed was also read.The prisoner made no defence, but his counsel calledMR. CHARLES JONES . I am a wine and brandy merchant, and live in Mark-lane. I was in partnership with Mr. Wait from September 1811, to September 1816, and had frequent opportunities of seeing him write; for the last three years of that time I saw his writing three or four times a week. (looks at the letter dated September 1822.) I have seen this before, somebody on the part of the Bank produced it, and asked if I thought it was Mr. Wait's hand writing, or whether I knew it was his. I have been subpoened here on the part of the Bank.Q. (Looking at the letter) Tell me whether you believe it to be his hand-writing or not - A. The two letters""it"" at the end of the name, I think resemble it in a small degree, but every other part of it I think very unlike Mr. Wait's writing; at least very unlike any of his writing that I ever saw. I stated this to the gentleman who applied to me, and that I did not believe it to be his writing.Q. After having intimated that, had you any message from the Bank - A. I had a letter on the 3d of December, stating, that it would not be necessary for me to attend the prosecution. I have known Mr. Wait, eleven years; everytransaction of his with me was of the most honourable kind, his general character was an upright honourable man.MR. SERJEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Did you not when applied to on the part of the Bank, desire you might not be called, because it would be unpleasant - A. I did.Q. And did you not at the same time state that there were many other persons much more able to speak to his writing than you, because you had not seen it lately. - A. Exactly so, and the gentleman said it was probable they should have sufficient evidence. It is six years since I saw him write, I said the""it"" at the end of the name bore a resemblance.MR. SERGEANT PELL. Q. Was it after you said it would be painful for you to be called as a witness, and that you did not think it to be his writing, that you were subpoened - A. Yes.COURT. Q. You applied to the Bank that you might not be called upon - A. I requested I might not at the moment I saw the writing. I had seen it at the time I wished to be excused from attending, but upon reflection, I considered it my duty to appear after forming my opinion on it.MR. MOORE. I am a wholesale wine and brandy merchant, of Bristol. I was in partnership with Mr. Wait, about five years, at Bristol, and had an opportunity of frequently seeing him write; he did not take an active part in the business (looks at the letter dated September, 1822.) I believe I have seen this before - the magistrate's clerk at Bristol shewed it to me. I was subpoened on the part of the Bank, and afterwards had notice that I need not attend. I had not expressed any opinion on the letter - I told them I did not conceive myself called upon to give an opinion, and I should decline it.Q. Now, do you believe that to be Mr. Wait's handwriting - A. From the opportunities I had of seeing his writing, (which was certainly very frequently) this is certainly very different indeed from what I recollect of the character of his writing. I always considered him a gentleman of the highest propriety, and that was his general character.COURT. Q. When did your partnership with him cease - A. I think six years ago, but I have seen his writing since.Q. If you received a letter in that hand-writing what would be the impression on your mind - A. I should have doubted its authenticity. Mr. Jones was in partnership with us. James George , Esq., Mayor of Bristol; John Cave , Esq., Sheriff of Bristol; Sir Richard Ball , Alderman of Bristol; Richard Henry Davis , Esq., M. P. for Bristol; Edward Brotheroe , Esq, late Member for Bristol; the Reverend - Biddulph, Minister of St. James's, Bristol; the Reverend - Roberts, Dissenting Minister; - Bruce, Esq.; Samuel Broad , Esq.; Joseph Piney , Esq.; Messrs.

I locked up all the other rooms, and returned about half-past eleven o'clock; I found the parlour door broken open, and every thing taken out of the drawers. I lost the articles stated in the indictment - the prisoner was gone; I did not see him again till he was in custody. I had the waistcoat to make from a slopseller. JOHN MURPHY .

I am single, and keep a circulating library and stationer's shop in South Audley-street, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. On the 29th of November, about a quarter to six o'clock in the evening, I was writing in the parlour, behind the shop - my candle had been lighted above an hour; nobody was in the shop. I heard an unusual noise, rose up, opened the parlour door, and found the shop door wide open - it had been shut, and has a bell to it to give notice if it is opened. I cast my eye on the counter, and missed three reams of paper, which I had received two hours before - I ran to the door, saw nobody, and thought no more of it; but next day some was produced to me, which corresponds in quality and quantity. I had bought it of Messrs. Wilson. I had been out of the shop about a quarter of an hour, and leftthe door on the latch, in the usual way. If it had not been opened with great caution the bell must have rang. BENJAMIN WM. VALENTINE . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 29th of November, a little after six o'clock at night, I was with Westcoatt; we turned into George-street, and saw the prisoner standing with something in his arms; he was seven or eight minutes walk from Miss Morris's. We passed him a few yards, turned back, and by that time he had got inside the door of one Joseph's house. I looked in, and asked him if he lodged there, he said he did; I asked if there were any other lodgers - Westcoatt came in and seized him. I took this paper from him. I found Miss Morris out next day. WILLIAM WESTCOATT . I was with Valentine; his account is correct. I asked the prisoner how he came by the parcel, he said he had just bought it; I asked where, he made no answer; I said,""Then I shall take you;"" he then said he picked it up in Duke-street, on a step, and afterwards that he found it in Tom's-court. Next day I got information, and took it to Miss Morris's. DANIEL TOMALIN . I am porter to Mr. Wilson, a wholesale stationer. On the 29th of November, I delivered this paper to Miss Morris; the same wrapper is now on it. REUBEN JOSEPH . I live in George-street, Grosvenor-square, and keep a sale-shop. On the 29th of November I heard some person in the passage. I went up stairs, and before I could ask the prisoner a question, the officer came in and questioned him; he said he lodged there. They took him away. I did not know him before. I saw Westcoatt take the bundle from him. THOMAS HAMMOND . I am servant to Mr. Wilson, and know the paper to be what I sent Miss Morris.

I am shopman to Mr. Williams, Cable-street. On the 1st of October a smock-frock was pawned with me, I call it a smock-frock, because it has an extra collar. I have no recollection of the prisoner.Q. Do you swear that - A. I do. I have seen her in the shop before, three or four times.(Property produced and sworn to.)Prisoner's Defence. I brought that woman from on board a ship, she has run me into every kind of danger, she brought a man to my room and robbed him of a sovereign. I said I would not have that done in my room, she sent me word yesterday that if she could not transport me, she would get another person that would. I have pawned my things to give her bread, as for the shirt she knew of it as well as I did, she does it entirely out of spite. ELIZABETH HINTON . On my oath it is false. ELIZA CLARK . I live in Rosemary-lane, Hinton, the prisoner and myself, all lived in a house together, and when we had no money we pledged our clothes one for the other, as far as it would go, and after that she left usand lived opposite, and brought a duck-frock for Pomroy to pawn for her and her man to buy a breakfast, I did not notice it; it was lined with blue; I believe, she delivered it in my presence.Q. There was no secret at all about it - A. No, they were good friends. Hinton brought a man in one night, and robbed him. Pomroy found it out and did not like such goings on, and gave her leave to quit the room, this was about three weeks before the frock was brought to pledge; she brought Hinton the money. I think it was 15 d. I believe Pomroy kept the duplicate - See page, 14. ELIZABETH HINTON . It is false, my Lord. It is made up between the parties. I never delivered her the money. I was not without money; it is all a false report about my bringing a man home; she did not quarrel with me about any man. Clark is an unfortunate woman, I believe. GUILTY . Aged 30.

I live at Attfield, Broadoak. On the 29th of November I came to town, and about half-past five o'clock in the morning, my cart stood in Bell-yard, Warwick-lane. My coat was on the horse. I saw it safe five minutes before it was taken, and the prisoner in the yard; he was employed to carry meat about the market. I was unpacking my goods in the yard, and missed it; and on Wednesday last I went with the officer and took the prisoner in his master's yard, in Chick-lane, and told him it was for stealing a coat, he said he had nothing on his arm but a cloth. JOHN PLAYER . I am salesman to Messrs. Challis and Company, Newgate Market, and have known the prisoner some time. Yesterday week, between five and six o'clock, I met him in Stationer's-court with a rough great-coat on his arm; I spoke to him and went on. I am sure he had a coat. As soon as I went to work, I met Mr. Mumford enquiring after his coat, I told him I had met a person with one, and afterwards told him who it was, and described the coat to him. I saw it after the prisoner was taken; it appeared like the one I saw him with; he is a slaughterman, and was in his working dress at the time. BENJAMIN PRATT . I am collector of the City tolls. On Friday morning, the 29th of November, between five and six o'clock, I stood at the bottom of Paternoster-row, and saw a man with a coat on his arm coming from the market.

I left him, and went on Ludgate-hill. Jackson afterwards asked me about it, and at first I denied having seen him, not wishing to be in trouble about it, but afterwards said he was the man. WILLIAM JACKSON . I am a beadle. I went down Chick-lane, with Mumford, and apprehended the prisoner, and afterwards found the coat at a house in Black Boy-alley, Chick-lane.

JAMES WREN . I am servant to Mr. Salt, a cornchandler. I wanted to issue two writs, and bought the stamps for that purpose; and last Monday I called at the City Arms for Thompson, a law writer, who fills up writs; he was not there, and the prisoner offered to do it. I said if he would do it properly I would give him half-a-crown, and put the stamps down before him; he set to writing.Q. You never expected to receive the paper in the state you delivered it to him - A. He was to fill them up; he sat down and began writing. I went to another part of the room for the newspaper, and he went out at the other door with the stamps and papers; there was two papers not written on; I laid them down with the two affidavit stamps for him to fill up, and also make the affidavits. The papers were stamped with a 5 s. stamp. I was not alarmed at missing them, but sat a few minutes, and then began to wonder where he was, and from what I heard, I went to Mr. Hildyard where I bought them, and found he had been there and sold them; he was to fill all the papers up. He heard me inquiring for Thompson, and said he could do it, and shewed me an affidavit to convince me of it. I found him the same evening at the City Arms, and took him. I told him he had treated me very ill. I had written""17 s. 6 d."" in figures on the stamps before I delivered them to him.PRISONER. Q. Did you not ask me to fetch the stamps - A.

I came up with him outside the gate, and said,""My good fellow what are you going to do with that chest;"" he mentioned some name. I collared him, he gave a hollow like an owl, and the prisoner came from over the way, struck me on the mouth, and cut my lip without saying any thing; I had hold of the man at the time, and he threw the chest down; it struck me on the toe.

I live at Richmond, on the the 11th of November, about one o'clock, I received adividend of 40 l. at the Bank, and had 60 l. before in my pocket-book, which was in my outside coat-pocket. I was going to dine in Serle-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, there was no coach at the Bank, and I went to the Mansion house, public-house, and had a pint of porter with my friend Brownley, who came out of the Bank with me. I had no conversation with any one at the public-house, we came out, and at the end of the court leading into the street, I saw some persons and one of them gave a spring forward, I turned round to my friend and said,""Let us get a coach, for we are in bad company,"" I saw the person who sprung forward sufficiently to know him, it was the prisoner; I saw him again ten days after, but was not very positive of him, when I first saw him, I thought him very like the man, but he was differently dressed. When I came out of the public-house door, I buttoned my coat and perceived my pocket-book there, I walked along the passage, the man sprang forward and in two mintutes, I felt and missed it and have not since seen it. There were five or six people about me, they continued where they were on the man's springing forward, I got aside of them and got away; I got into a coach at the end of the Old Jewry, and found my pocket cut through when I got to Mr. Ross's.Cross-examined by MR.

At Mr. Ross's, twenty minutes or half an hour after I left the public-house, I came out of the public-house near two o'clock, it was the day Hunt came to town, but before he came, there were a great many people all along the street.Q. Who first pointed the prisoner out to you - A. I saw him at the Mansion-house sitting down, I called an officer and said""That is the man who jumped out, but I cannot swear he robbed me."" THOMAS BROWNLEY . I am acquainted with Mr. Prentice. I came out of the Bank with him, and came towards the Mansion-house public-house. A man who appeared like a coachman, stood at the back of my chair, in the public-house, and when I got up to come away he walked out before us, we came into the passage and I believe the man who jumped out from the wall was the same who was in the house. Just as we came out Mr. Prentice said he thought we were in bad company, we went on to the Old Jury, called a coach which he got into, and I left. I saw the prisoner in custody at the Mansion-house last Thursday week, I could not exactly say that he is the man, but very strongly suspected that he was, and I am almost sure of it. I am possitive of it now.Q. What makes you more positive now than at the Mansion-house - A. I have considered it more and am more convinced that he is the man.Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY - Q. What are you - A. A baker. I will swear the prisoner is the man I saw; when he was at the Mansion-house, he was in a different garb, he was the same stature, and I believe the same countenance.Q, Do you mean to swear you are positive, or that you only believe he is the man - A. I believe it. EDWARD STAMMERS . I am a clerk in the Bank. On the 11th of November, I paid the dividend warrant in four 10 l. notes - Nos. 19,928 to 19,931, dated the 19th of October, 1822. I have the entry here in my own writing. JOSEPH BAKER . I am shopman to Messrs. Forrest and Co., pawnbrokers, Warwick-row, Blackfriars-road. On the 12th of November, I received a 10 l. note from a person who gave the name of James Gilbert - I gave the same note to the officer; (Looking at No. 19,928) - this is it, it has my writing on it,"" James Gilbert , for Mr. Honeyman, Fleece, Little Knight Rider-street, Paul's-chain."" I have not seen Gilbert since. JOSEPH MARTIN . I am one of the day patrol. On the 27th of November, I went with Mr. Prentice, to the Fleece, public-house - I sent him into the parlour, and told him to take no notice of me. I went in afterwards and Gilbert was not there. The prisoner was in the bar, and said Gilbert lodged there, and would be in between eight and nine o'clock. I said I came respecting a 10 l. note, which had been paid by Gilbert to the pawnbroker, and which was a stolen one; he said he had sent a 10 l. note by Gilbert, to redeem a pledge. Gilbert did not come in, and I told the prisoner he must go with me to the Mansion House - this was a little after seven o'clock; he put on his hat and walked with me. I left Mr. Prentice to wait the arrival of Gilbert. I then asked the prisoner how he became possessed of this 10 l. note; he stated that on the afternoon of the 11th, the landlord and landlady were out, and he was minding the bar all the afternoon, and between five and six o'clock a person came in, and had some brandy and water, and asked for change for a 10 l. note - that he gave him change out of his own pocket. I asked what address the person gave; he said he thought he had sufficient knowledge of a good note from a bad one, and did not ask him, and that he could not write and could not put the address on if he had heard it. In about three quarters of an hour the prosecutor and his friends brought Gilbert. We sat in the porter's lodge, where there is a good gas light - I think only me, the porter, and the prisoner were there. The prosecutor called me out in a few minutes, and stated that he was confident, and would swear the person who was there was the person who sprang before him at the time he came out of the public-house. After we went in again, the prisoner said,""I have not yet seen the note, and wish to see it."" This note and two others which had gone into the Bank, laid on the table, and he picked out this one as that he sent by Gilbert. I said then if he could not write he could read writing; he said""I can write a little, I did not mean to say I could not write at all - there is my writing on the top of the note,"" and he thought he wrote it for the name of Day; but on looking at it, it was Mr. Davis, King-street, Cheapside, written in a very bad hand. He was taken on Wednesday, and detained till Thursday, and taken to the Mansion House, and we were sent to Guildhall. The prisoner told me he wore a white coat and a cap on the day of Hunt's entry, and went out to see Hunt, but went no farther than St. Paul's Church-yard.Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you were talking with him at the public-house was the prosecutor there - A. No; he was in the parlour, and the door shut. I think he saw me taking the prisoner away; he could not see his face - the bar is very dark. He might go into the parlour without seeing him.Gilbert being called did not appear.Prisoner's Defence. I was assisting a friend who keeps the public-house in Little Knight Rider-street, and on the11th of November, about a quarter or twenty minutes past one o'clock, some persons came in, and said Hunt was coming - two young men ran out, and I followed them. I went opposite the South door of St. Paul's, till Hunt passed, then returned, and in Sermon-lane, met Peer, and told him he was too late, for Hunt was gone by. I was not absent more than ten minutes, Mrs. Christie asked if I had seen Hunt - I said, Yes. She went up to dress, and went to meet her husband about three o'clock, and left me in charge of the house. Three persons came in about five o'clock, and had brandy and water - one of them came and asked for change for a 10 l. note; I refused - he said he could not pay me, I sent the servant girl to get change, she could not, and having money in my pocket, I gave change; I asked his address, he said,""Davis, King-street, Cheapside;"" a few days after, I sent Gilbert, who had lived servant with me before, to redeem some articles, and he gave the note. The prosecutor saw me attending to the business of the house sometime, and said nothing about me. Directly I was asked about it, I said, I sent Gilbert with the note, and explained every thing. SUSAN CHRISTIE . My husband keeps the Fleece, public-house, Knight Rider-street. I remember the day Hunt made his entry - he passed about half-past one o'clock; I was in the parlour, and my husband was at Vauxhall. The prisoner lived in the house - I told him from the noise I heard that Hunt was going by; he went out, and returned in five minutes, and was about the house all day while I was at home. I went out at half-past three o'clock and am certain he never went out during that time. I left him in care of the house.COURT. Q. What makes you speak particular as to the time he was absent - A. I particularly requested him not to stay, as I wished to go out; but some gentlemen came in after he had been out, and detained me. JAMES SMITH . I am a baker. I was at the Fleece public-house, about five o'clock on the day Hunt arrived, the prisoner was then in the bar serving. I was at the bar and heard a gentleman ask him to change a 10 l. note, he gave his name Davis, or Jarvis. RICHARD SAMUELS . I am a shoemaker. I was by St. Paul's when Hunt passed, and saw the prisoner at the end of Black Swan-alley, facing the Fleece, between half-past one and two o'clock. THOMAS BELL . I work at a callenderer's.

I saw Hunt pass and returned to the house about twenty minutes or a quarter before two, he was there then - I dined there - I had ordered a steak before I went out. JAMES BOARD . I am a callenderer. I was at the Fleece at one o'clock, and went out to see Hunt, the prisoner was in the house then, I remained until two, but did not see him after a quarter before two. ROBERT PEER .

I went out before the procession came, returned, and had more to drink, he was there then, and between half-past one and half-past two I went up Sermon-lane, and met him with two little children returning to the Fleece he said I was too late. SAMUEL HAWKINS . I am employed in the Perogative-office, Doctor's Commons, and dine at the Fleece. I have known the prisoner eight or nine years. I saw him at the Fleece the day Hunt arrived, cooking chops, which I ordered at half-past one.

JAMES ALEXANDER DE RIEMER . I rent a house in Euston-place, in the parish of St. Pancras, Middlesex. In the night between the 13th and 14th of November, my house was broken open. I was the last person up - there was no alarm in the night, the front fastenings of the house were all safe when I went to bed - I did not examine the back. Charlotte Burge got up first in the morning and alarmed me about seven o'clock, I came down, it was light then. I found the back kitchen window up, and the mark of an instrument between the cill of the window and the bottom sash; there was a large hole in one of the shutters of that window which are inside, the mark on the cill had been made by raising the window, the catch of the window was broken off by the force of raising the sash; there is a yard behind the house which is enclosed by a wall, ten feet hight, there were marks on that wall of two persons having got down - there is a row of houses on the other side of the wall; the property was stolen from the parlour. When they got into the kitchen the door was bolted outside, and a pannel was taken out of the door, which was safe overnight. We missed fourteen spoons from the parlour, worth about 9 l. at least, a pen-knife, from the cheffoneer drawer, a plated wire funnel, worth 1 l., a snuff-box, worth 10 s., it was a tortoiseshell, mounted with gold, and a phleme, worth 1 s.; the robbery was on Sunday night, and on Monday following, I went to the office and found all the property. CHARLOTTE BURGE . I am cook to Mr. De Riemer. On the night of the robbery, I went to bed at ten o'clock, the kitchen was safe then, the shutter was barred and entire, and the window sash also. I heard no noise in the night.I bolted the back kitchen door, the bolts are outside - there was then no hole in it. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning, it was just day-light, I found the front kitchen door open; and the back kitchen door open, a piece cut out of it, and a piece out of the shutter, and the window up as high as it could be. I first called my fellow-servant and then my master - the spoons were safe on the evening before, in the back parlour sideboard drawer. I missed the articles stated in the indictment - an umbrella, belonging to Martha Hurst , my fellow servant, hung up near the back kitchen door, it was gone - I found it at the office with the other property. THOMAS PACE . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the morning of the 14th November, about six o'clock (it was not day-light), I called on Pople and Handley. We went to No. 13, Castle-street, Seven Dials, the street-door was open; the house is full half an hour's walk from the prosecutor's. We went up stairs; I being first, went to the top of the attic-stairs, and found an umbrella very wet, the wet running from it; this was claimed by Charlotte Burge , as belonging to her fellow servant. I listened at the door, and heard the voice of two or three men speaking in a low tone. I burst the door open, and saw silver articles on a deal table. Watts, Fuller, and Brown were sitting round the fire; the table was between Watts and Fuller. I knew Watts, ran to him with a cutlass held it to his breast, and told him if he moved I would run him through. Handley then was holding a pistol to Herd's head, who was in bed with Banfield. Cooper secured the property - there were fourteen silver spoons, and a wine-funnel on the table. I handcuffed Fuller and Brown - while doing so, I saw a snuff-box (which I now produce) drop from either Watts or Fuller, but which I cannot say. Handley handcuffed Watts. We then ordered Herd to get out of bed, which he did; he dressed himself all but his coat, and then said,""Let me go to the other side of the room for my coat, which hangs on a chair."" I followed him, and when he had his coat in his hand, and was going to put it on, this knife dropped from the pocket. We ordered Banfield to get up and dress herself. Cooper asked the prisoners who the plate belonged to; neither of them made any reply, that I recollect. When Cooper had searched the room, I said I would have a search, and by the right-hand side of the fire-place, I found a board loose in the floor, which I took up; there was a hollow space under it, and some way from the hole, as far as I could reach my hand, I found five skeleton keys, and one other key, tied together, a hook, a chisel, a screw-driver, a stock for a centre-bit, an iron crow-bar, and dark lanthorn; and on the back of the chair where Fuller sat, was this old blue coat, very wet; and on the side of the bed where Herd lay, I found a pair of old worsted stockings, very wet and very dirty. We took all the prisoner's to the watch-house, and from there to the office. The coat Fuller had on was dry, and had feathers on it, as if he had been on a bed. Brown's hat, coat, waistcoat and pantaloons were very wet indeed, and all their shoes were dirty with fresh dirt; they appeared to have been dried by the fire. They did not say where they had been. On the Monday following, I and Cooper went to the prosecutor's house, with all the implements, also the knife and snuff-box, and on examination I found the sash had been forced up, and the chisel and screwdriver exactly fitted the marks on the cill and and bottom of the sash; the window-catch was forced off and a hole bored through the shutter. We found in the front kitchen a cupboard forced open by the side of the fire-place, and the same two instruments fitted the marks on that door. In the middle door of the back kitchen were marks of centre-bits; at each corner of the pannel which was taken out (I produce it), the beading which confined the pannel was cut away with a knife, so that it came out. We examined the wall and the vault door, it appeared that they had climbed up on the door, and then on the wall. It would take a full half hour to make an an entrance with these instruments; the robbery altogether would occupy above three quarters of an hour. The prosecutor claimed the knife and snuff-box immediately on seeing them.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. At what time did you get to Castle-street - A. About seven o'clock - it was day light then and did not rain. I got up between five and six o'clock; it rained hard then, and I went to bed. I arose again about a quarter to six, it was then a gentle mizzling rain, and did not rain heavy afterwards; it left off about six o'clock. It rained hard in the middle of the night - I do not know whether the previous evening was wet. I was never in the house before. I did not then know who belonged to it. I only saw one bed in the room.Q. Five people don't usually sleep in one bed - A. I have seen as many. There was a good fire there. Brown sat in a chair on the left of the fire - the bed was in a recess. I think the room is not twenty feet square. The moment the door was opened, Brown looked over his shoulder - he had his shoes and hat on; his coat was very wet; it was a blue one. I did not ask to see his shoes; they appeared wet, and it was fresh wet as if he had been out that morning. He was very wet altogether - his clothes and shoes satisfied me that he had been out that morning. They were all sitting round a good fire. Euston-place is on the same side of the way as Pancras New Church.Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Watts and Fuller were fully dressed - A. Yes; their clothes were dampish. Fuller's coat appeared to have been taken off the bed. He denied that the coat at the back of the chair was his.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Herd was in bed quite undressed - A. Yes - so was Banfield; she said she was very ill, and I beleive she was; she had a black eye and bruises about her. There were nobody besides the prisoners in the room. I looked at the stockings by the bed before Herd got up; I wrapped them up, and brought them away - he put on a clean pair of white ones, his coat was on the left hand side of the bed - I found nothing on him, but saw him drop the knife, his coat was dryish, it did not hang by the fire; his breeches were not exactly dry, they were not in the state they would be if he had been out in a heavy rain. I believe his waistcoat was dry, but did not notice it - his hat and shoes appeared to have been out in a heavy rain; he might have dried his clothes - his hat appeared to have been dried by the fire; I can tell that because I am a hatter by trade. Herd asked me before the Magistrate if the stockings were not in the pocket of thecoat - I said No, I picked them up by the bed side, and then put them myself into the coat pocket. The snuff-box, implements, and pen-knife have been in my possession ever since.MR. DE REIMER. I think the pen-knife is mine; it appears the same as was taken that night. I had it three or four months - I have no mark on it. I am certain of the snuff-box, it is marked with my initials.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It is a common pen-knife - A. Yes; if I saw it in a person's possession I should not claim it by any mark. JOSEPH COOPER . I went with Pace to Castle-street. We got there about seven o'clock. Pace had called on me a little after six; it had been a very wet night, but did not rain when I came out. We went up stairs, broke the door open. Fuller, Brown, and Watts, sat by the fire. Herd and Banfield were in bed together. We told them we came to take them into custody, and on the table we found a wine funnel, and fourteen silver spoons in a blue rag, which was very wet, A tortoiseshell box was dropped, which Pace picked up. Herd was dressing at the time. Pace found a hole at the corner of the room, and pulled from under the floor the house-breaking implements. We did not find the centre bit belonging to the stock. I took from the mantle-piece a gardner's pruning knife; and after Herd and Banfield had got up, I found a silver box in the bed, with thirty silver counters in it; we found the owner for that. I found a wet blue coat hanging on the back of a chair in which I believe Fuller sat. By the side of the bed was a pair of worsted stocking with the feet wet. When Herd got up he put on a pair of clean while stockings. Two pair of their shoes out of the four were wet; one pair which Herd put on were soaking wet through. I think Brown had on a wet pair too; and the other two pair which appeared more dry, looked as if they had been dried by the fire. In a box claimed by Banfield I found a red pocket-book of this year, with a silver lock to it, with several cuts of a knife in it. After taking them away. Handley and I went back, and made a second search in the same room; this was between eleven and twelve. Handley found a letter and a file. We then went to Russell's, White Lion-Court, Seven Dials, to the first floor, back room, and found a woman's reticule basket, with seven picklock keys, and one latch key; and in the table drawer we found a googe bit, which would drill a hole. We also found a hat and coat there, which Fuller claimed; there was a bed in that room; we found nobody there. An umbrella was found on the landing-place in Castle-street. The prosecutor's cook claimed it as her fellow servant's property. The wet had ran from it; it must have been there some time, for the wet from it had soaked into the floor. We went to the office, and the prisoner's were put to the bar for examination; and Fuller claimed the hat and coat which I brought from Russell's. On the Monday following, we went to the prosecutors; the chisel and screw-driver fitted the marks in the window. I have no doubt those instruments had been used there. and also at the kitchen and cupboard doors.Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The spoons were concealed in a blue rag - A. Yes, I did not see them till I undid them. I found what they were, and asked them all round if they were theirs; nobody claimed them. I did not take them out of the rag; the funnel was not covered over.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Herd and Ban-field were undressed and in bed - A. Yes, I believe Herd's coat was damp, but not so wet as the others. I did not examine his waistcoat; his shoes were wet; his hat was very wet; it did not appear to have been dried by the fire; the streets were wet and damp. Banfield appeared very ill.Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was not the night before very rainy - A. I went home about eleven o'clock, and it had not rained all the evening then.MR. DE RIEMER. The fourteen spoons are mine and have my initials on them. I believe the funnel to be mine from its size and appearance. CHARLOTTE BURGE . The umbrella belongs to my fellow servant Martha Hurst ; she has had it during the five years I have been there; neither of us were out the evening before; it was not wetted by us. EDWARD JOHN HANDLEY . I am officer of Queen-square. I accompained Cooper and Pace to Castle-street. We broke the room door open, and found the five prisoners there. Herd and the woman were in bed; the other three sat round the fire; there was a table standing between Fuller and Watts; the spoons and funnel were on it, and I took off a phleme. I saw the impliments of house-breaking found under the floor. Herd's shoes were very wet, and some of their clothes. I went to a lodging at Russell's, White Lion-street, which I suspected to be Fuller's, and he claimed a coat and hat which was brought from there; they were dry.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You examined Herd's things attentively - A. I examined his shoes, coat, and hat. I did not examine his waitcoat or breeches; his coat appeared dry, but his shoes very wet and dirty.MR. DE RIENER. I lost a phleme from the parlour, but cannot swear to this one.HERD'S Defence. I was in bed from twelve o'clock till I was apprehended, and I let these men in when they came in the morning.WATT'S Defence. On the night previous to my apprehension, I was with Fuller at a public-house, in St. James's. I told him I was going down to Richmond next day, and asked him to accompany me, which he agreed to, and appointed me to to call on him before six o'clock in the morning to breakfast. I called at his lodgings at the appointed time; he got up and dressed. His wife (who is Herd's sister) had words with him about going; he said he would go to his brothers and get breakfast, and we went there to breakfast. I knocked at the door. Banfield asked who was there and said, if we stopped while she unlocked the door and got into bed she would let us in, and did so. We asked for Herd; she said he was out, but she expected him in every moment, and asked us to sit down. We sat by the fire; and in about quarter of an hour Herd came in alone; and about ten minutes after Brown came up, and then Herd went to bed; the room was so dark I could discover nothing on the table till I pulled the curtain aside, I saw the funnel, but know no more.BROWN'S Defence. I called up there as I passed, but know nothing of the robbery.BANFIELD'S Defence. I went to bed about eleven o'clock. Herd came home between twelve and one, and never got out of bed till three men knocked at the door. I awoke him; he got out and let them in; two very decent men saw Herd home in liquor.HERD - GUILTY - DEATH . Aged 22.WATTS - GUILTY - DEATH . Aged 25.BROWN - GUILTY - DEATH .

THOMAS WILLIAM BAKER . I live in Foley-street, in the parish of Mary-le-bone. On Sunday the 27th of October, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw my tin cash-box safe in my bed-room, on one corner of my drawers. I had omitted to put it away in its usual place, as my mother-in-law was then in a dying state. Physwick had at that time lived not quite a week in my service, she left about seven o'clock that evening. I had a character with her, she gave me no notice of her going, nor did she wait for her wages. At the time she left we were at tea, and she was desired to take the tea up stairs to my mother-in-law, she came down, she was sent to feed the bird in the shop and we did not see her after that. In taking the tea up she must pass the room-door, where the cash-box was, she left the street-door on a jar. I apprehended her on the following Saturday the 1st of November, at Chatham. I have found the box with the writings that were in it, but all the money was gone. I have got one of the 5 l. notes from the Bank, and am sure it is one of those which were in my box. At the time it was stolen it contained two 5 l. notes, seven or eight sovereigns, a crooked guinea, one or three half sovereigns, a seven shilling piece, and about 5 l. in silver, with other things. I found the box at Mary-le-bone office. I don't know Stephenson; when I took Phywsick, I told her she had stolen my cash-box and money, she acknowledged taking it, I neither threatened or promised her. I found nothing on her. SAMUEL SMITH . I am servant to Mr. Wright, pawnbroker, of Tothill-street. I have a crooked guinea, which Stephenson brought into our shop and asked its value, I said it was light and gave her twenty shillings for it, which was the full value.MR. BAKER. That is the guinea which was in my box. THOMAS ROBERT HADLEY . I am servant to Mr. Price, linen-draper, of Tothill-street, Westminster, the prisoner Stephenson and a female named Smith, came into my master's shop, on Monday afternoon the 28th of October, and bought several articles. Smith tendered me a 5 l. note. I put on it,""Mrs. Smith, No. 1, Wright's-passage, Tothill-street,"" by which I know the note produced to be the same, it has my writing on it, they laid out about nineteen shillings in change. ELIZABETH SMITH . I live at No. 1, Wright's-passage, Tothill-street Stephenson came to me and asked me to go and see if this note was passable, I had washed for her before, I went alone first, to Wright's, the pawn-brokers, to ask if it was good. and they said it was good, but could not change it, she did not say how she came by it. I brought it back to her, she said""Go and change it, and buy something for yourself."" I said I did not like to go, she then said she would go too, we went to Mr. Price's, Hadley served us, we bought some black stuff for petticoats, a pair of black stockings for eighteen-pence, a black and red shawl, and some flannel, which came to eighteen shillings and sixpence, I gave him the note she had given me, I did not suspect any thing. I gave her the change, I was to have a pair of black stockings, a flannel, and a black petticoat. I said I did not wish any thing, the stuff bought, would make two flannel, and two black petticoats, she told me to take the things home and make them; this was on a Monday morning. and on Tuesday she came to me and said a young woman had robbed her master, and she was afraid she herself would get into prison, and the young woman too. She went away telling me to make her gown as soon as I could, and to take care of the things. I told this to the constable, when I was before the magistrate, the week after, I saw Physwick on Tuesday morning, she came with Stephenson, but was not by when she mentioned about the note. GILES CHAPMAN . I keep the Cooper's-arms, Strutton-ground. Stephenson came into my house and called for a pint of beer, on Monday evening the 28th of October between six and seven o'clock, and asked me to keep three sovereigns for her until the morning; when she would call for them, I had information, and when she called in the morning I detained them, and she went away, she was a little in liquor when she gave them to me; I have brought three with me, but they were mixed with others. EDWARD JOHN HANDLEY . I am an officer of Queen-square. On Tuesday morning I and Pace took Stephenson. I told her she was concerned in a robbery which Physwick had committed. She denied any knowledge of it or of Physwick. We kept her in custody, and some time after she sent for me, and said she would tell all she knew about it, and said voluntarily that this young woman, some time ago, had robbed her of a pair of shoes, and owed her a few shillings besides; and that on Sunday Physwick came and said she was come to make amends; that they went out on Monday morning and bought some things which we found at Smith's house, she denied all knowledge of any notes. I went with Mr. Baker to Chatham, and took Physwick, who confessed to me voluntarily that she had taken the box out of her master's bed-room, and took it to a court in Islington, which she did not know the name of, where she opened the box and took out what she could, and left the box against a wall there; that she afterwards came to Westminster, and went to Stephenson's,with the two notes in her hand, but she only saw what amount one of them was, and that was a five. That Stephenson took both notes out of her hand, and said she would get change for them; that she returned in an hour or two, and gave her four sovereigns, telling her she should have the remainder another time. When she was at the office, I shewed her the box, which somebody had taken to Mary-le-bone office, she said it was the same. Stephenson denied all knowledge of the notes. THOMAS PACE . I searched Stephenson on Monday night, and found about 10 s. on her; she was quite drunk. She keeps a house of ill-fame. I asked her where the sovereigns were, she said she had none, and knew nothing about them. In consequence of information I went to Chapman, who said he had three sovereigns, and described Stephenson to me. I found the property at Smith's, which had been bought at the linen-drapers. Some of it was under the stairs, and some in a back pace.PHYSWICK'S Defence. Stephenson is innocent of the robbery.STEPHENSON'S Defence. I knew nothing of the robbery. I had not seen this young woman for eighteen months; she came up and said her grandmother was dead, and had left her the money, and asked me to go with her to buy some things.PHYSWICK - GUILTY - DEATH .

MR. LAW conducted the prosecution. JOSEPH SIMPSON EYLES . I am a smith, and live in Jane-street, Commercial-road. I have known the prisoner a year and a half; I used to see him at the Globe coffee-shop, Beech-street, and at the St. John's, Cowcross-street. In August last he made an application to me, which I communicated to the police, and by their instructions I met him at the Globe coffee-shop on Monday evening, the 9th of October. I met him on several other occasions, and always with the knowledge of the police. On Friday afternoon, the 18th of October, about two o'clock, I met him at the St. John's, Cowcross-street, to receive the remainder of some money I had received the day before, two counterfeit half crowns and a shilling. I was to pay 10 d. for the half crowns, and 4 d. for the shilling. I met him on Friday to receive a half crown and a shilling more. I had given him 3 s. 6 d. on the Tuesday, to supply me with as much as that would produce at the rate I mentioned; three half crowns and two shillings were to be given me for 3 s. He then owed me 4 d. I had met him on Thursday and Friday to receive counterfeit money for the 3 s. 6 d. which I gave him on Tuesday. It was marked money, given to me by Armstrong. I gave the counterfeit money I received of him to Attfield, but what I received on the 18th I gave to Armstrong. He did not give me the 4 d., as he had not got it, and said the next purchase I made he should want 3 d. for the stuff to do the money over with.Cross-examined by MR. STIRLING. Q. You was not present when he was searched - A. No. I am a smith by trade, and now work for one Burt. The prisoner asked me to buy counterfeit money. I occasionally get jobs for myself. I never informed against people. I got money from the officers to buy the counterfeit money. I believe I have had about 22 s. from them besides, for loss of time. This is the only transaction I had with the police. My reason for informing of him was, because he asked me to go out with him several times, and afterwards asked me to buy money.MR. LAW. Q. Being out of employ, he asked you to pass had money with him - A. Yes. I refused, and thought it my duty to inform. JOSHUA ARMSTRONG . I am an officer. I have heard Eyles's account, it is correct. He first gave me information on the 8th or 9th of October. I informed the solicitor of the Mint, and supplied him with money from time to time to purchase counterfeit coin. On the 10th of October I supplied him with 3 s. 6 d. to purchase, and 2 s. 6 d. for himself to spend. I marked the 3 s. 6 d. so as to know it again. I apprehended the prisoner on the 23 d. Eyles had given three half crowns, and 2 s., on the 18th of October, all counterfeit. I gave him two marked shillings on the 23d of October, at night, (about two hours before I took the prisoner). I told Vann to go to St John's Coffee-shop to watch, and after waiting some time, I saw the prisoner and Eyles, and another man, come out together. I followed them up a court; Eyles and the prisoner were talking together. I followed them to the Queen's Head public-house, where I had stationed Attfield. I secured the prisoner, and took him into that house. Vann junior was with me. I said I must take him for uttering bad money to the carroly man who had just left him, he denied it, saying, he never sold any in all his life, that he had all good money about him. In his right-hand breeches pocket I found a purse, containing five or six shillings of good money - it was not the silver I had marked. In the same pocket, I found two loose shillings, which he said he had had some time, I found that it was the money I had marked and given that night to Eyles. I said that very money had been in my possession not an hour ago, and he said,""Lord bless me! the man who was walking with me must have put it into my pocket."" I have kept the 2 s. ever since, I gave Attfield the counterfeit money I received from Eyles on the 18th; I could not take him on the 18 h, as it was very rainy, and I did not see him come out of the house.Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say how the two marked shillings got into his pocket - A. No.MR. LAW. Q. Did he say he had but five shillings and not seven shillings - A. No. The purse and the two shillings were in sight when I asked how long he had it; he could not avoid seeing them; he was much agitated at the time. JOHN VANN . My father is an officer. On the 23d of October, Armstrong gave me information, and I went to St. John's coffee-shop, in Cow Cross-street, and saw the prisoner standing in the coffee-room. Eyles was sitting down, and I sat directly opposite him, about four yards from the prisoner, who was talking with Eyles for about ten minutes, and they appeared well acquainted. I heard the prisoner say he could not get them without - but I could not hear the rest of the sentence. Eyles gave him a paper over the settle; he took it and put it into his pocket. In about five minutes I came out and went to the Queen's Head, at the corner of St. John's-lane, where I saw Attfield, and I told him the prisoner had received a paper from Eyles. At that moment the prisoner came by, and Armstrong was behind him. Another man besides Eyles was with him. Armstrong then took him into the Queen's Head. I held his hand while Armstrong searched him; his account is correct. I saw Armstrong give Eyles the two shillings about an hour before he went to the house. WILLIAM ATTFIELD . I am an officer. I have heard the witness's account; it is correct as far as I was present. I received counterfeit money from Armstrong on the 18th. MARIA JORDAN . I am servant to William Taylor , who keeps the Globe Coffee-shop in Beech-street. In August last I frequently saw the prisoner and Eyles in company together there. I am certain of their persons.Cross-examined. Q. You know Eyles - A. Yes, by hisfrequenting the place. I cautioned the prisoner to have nothing to do with him.Mr. LAW. Q. Had any thing occurred to make you caution him - A. I had heard he was a bad character, I did not know the prisoner's character at that time. I saw them in company after that as often as ever. MARY ANN BARNS . I am servant at the St. John's Coffee-shop. I have frequently seen Eyles and the prisoner talking together. Eyles came one day, and told me to tell the prisoner to meet him at seven o'clock that evening. I told him, he said he could not, but would meet him at eleven o'clock next day; this was on the Wednesday before he was apprehended. JOSEPH ALLEN . I have frequently seen the prisoner and Eyles at the coffee-shop in private conversation.MR. CALEB EDWARD POWELL . I am assistant to the solicitors of the Mint, and have been so thirty-two years. The three half-crowns are counterfeit, and of the same die; the two shillings are also counterfeit, and from the same die; they are merely washed, and have not been in circulation.Prisoner's Defence. The charge is totally false. I never had any dealing with the witness, and only know him by seeing him at the coffee-shop, where I went to look at the advertisements for a situation. The man came and sat down by me; he had been drinking, and said some friends had been treating him, which I suppose was the officers. I came out in a quarter of an hour, and was followed by him. I was seized and taken into a house. The officers asked what money I had, and took out my purse, containing 8 s. 6 d., and at the same time he had 2 s. in his hand. I said the money and papers belonged to me, and I did not know I had more than was in my purse, and if it was in my pocket it must have been put in. I received this man in the light of a friend at first, but find him a villain. Under all the circumstances, what credit can you attach to such a man. GUILTY . Aged 30.

She laid down a sovereign, which I took up, and found it a good one. I had laid her down the change, 18 s. 2 d., she then hesitated, and said it was not for herself, and the person she bought it for would think it too dear.

I took the change off the counter, and pushed the sovereign back to her, she took it up; she then said she would take it. I tendered her the change again; she put a sovereign across the counter. I never suspected it, concluding it was the same; and she went away with the change and soap. I discovered it was a bad one when I went to put it into my purse. I produce it.Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When she put the sovereign down you told her the price - A. I cannot speak to that. I did not tell her the price till she offered to pay. The counter was between us, She took the sovereign up and held it, as I thought, between her fingers and thumb. I discovered it was bad before I put it into my purse, and did not put it in. I had put it into my pocket first; there was no other sovereign there; it has not been in my possession ever since, but it was marked about a fortnight afterwards, and I can swear to it; it was in my pocket all that time, except when I produced it at Guildhall. I shewed it to several people myself, but never lost sight of it.MR. BOLLAND. Q. Is this the sovereign - A. It is. I put it into a paper, and put it into my pocket.MR. SEWELL. I am assistant to the solicitor of the Mint. This sovereign is counterfeit.Cross-examined. Q. Are there not officers of the Mint who know the coin - A. Yes. They are only examined in capital prosecutions. I have been clerk to the solicitor of the mint for thirty years, and attend particularly to business of this description. GUILTY . Aged 20.

CHARLES HOWSE and JAMES BULL were indicted for stealing, on the 29th of November, from the person of William Puddiford , a 20 l. a 10 l. and six 5 l. Bank notes , his property. WILLIAM PUDDIFORD . I am a cow-keeper and hay-salesman. On the 29th of November, about three o'clock, I was at the Welch Harp, Edgware-road - it is five miles from Tyburn turnpike - my son, who is twenty-two years old, sat at the bar at tea with me, the prisoners came into the parlour afterwards, and while they were there, I looked at my notes. I had 60 l. I folded them up, and put them into my right-hand breeches pocket loose. I knew Howse before by sight; Bull was quite a stranger, we came away all three together in a gig, as Howse asked me to ride. I sat on the near side, Bull sat next to me, and Howse drove. I rode as far as Lisson Grove, then got out, and put my hand into my pocket (which was buttoned when I got into the gig) and missed my money - I said""I have lost my money and one of you must have got it,"" they had not got out of the gig - Howse said,""Mr. Puddiford, I hope you do not think I have got it;"" I said, one of them must have got it; one of them then said,""There lies your note behind you,"" I then took up a 20 l. note, about two yards from the gig - I said,""This is not all by a great deal, you have got 40 l. more;"" the watchman stood by and said,""What is that you say, have they got your money"" - I said""Yes, and I give you charge of them."" Howse immediately whipped his horse and galloped away - we went after them - the watchman sprang his rattle, and hollowed,""Stop the gig;"" they drove on nearly half a mile, till they came to Baker-street, then Howse was thrown out and secured; he said,""Puddiford, I hope you are not going to leave me locked up."" I found a 10 l. and two 5 l. notes, about three hundred and fifty yards from Lisson Grove, between that and Baker-street. I went home, returned, and found in the same road nearer to town, some notes, but as I cannot read, I cannot tell what they are; they were trod upon and torn all to pieces. I had drank two pints of ale with another person - I was sober.Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is not your name Pettiford - A. I don't know how it is spelt, some spell it""Ped"" and some""Pud."" I had a box coat on, which was buttoned up over my clothes. I sat in the corner of the gig, Bull sat nearly on my thigh - we left the house just before four o'clock. I only had two pints of ale. I do not think that the landlord refused to give me more liquor. While I was in the gig I asked them twice to stop and drink, they refused - they pulled up for me to get out.Q. Did not you charge one of the patrole with stealing your money - A. No; as I came out of Mary-le-bone office, I saw the dog which followed the gig, and said, that was the dog."" I did not complain of any officers not taking a patrol into custody. I cannot swear the rattle did not frighten the horse.COURT. Q. You said he whipped the horse - A. Yes, I generally feel for my money when I leave company, the note laid about two yards behind me - it was not a windy night. I did not go in the track the notes were found - they were found on the left side of the road, fifteen yards from the path. WILLIAM SUTHERLAND . I am a watchman. I came up just after the prisoner got out of the gig, he was speaking to the two men, I asked how he came to loose his money, they at that moment drove off, but not very quick, for about twelve paces then turned round and came back, and said""What do you mean Puddiford, to say we have got your money,"" he said he had lost it and had been no where but with them in the gig, he persisted in saying they must have it, and said,""take charge of them."" they immediately turned the gig, whipped the horse, and made off as fast as they could, a man had hold of the reins, they snatched them from him, I pursued calling""Stop-thief,"" they drove by all the watchmen, I came up with Howse who was dirty, and asking for his hat, I think he had been thrown out. I saw Puddiford pick up the 20 l. note; the road is very wide. JOHN PIZZY . I am sergeant of the watch, I was going my rounds after five o'clock, and about three quarters of a mile from Baker-street, I met the prisoner in the gig, I triedto stop it. Howse struck me with the whip and went on at full gallop. I sprang my rattle, called out""Stop thief, stop the gig,"" they got out of my sight, I am sure they are the same men. I afterwards took Howse, between Baker-street and Boston-street, his coat and face were very dirty, he resisted going to the watch-house.Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Was he not enquiring about his hat - A. Yes, he was not standing still. WILLIAM SELLERS . I am an officer, I took Bull about nine o'clock at night, on the 29th of November. Howse had told me where to find him, he said he was innocent. I have a 10 l.; a 20 l.; and part of a 10 l; and 5 l. Bank notes.Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Howse's friend took you to Bull by his desire - A. He did. WILLIAM PUDDIFORD . I know the 10 l. note by a tear in it.- SMITH. The prosecutor gave me twenty sovereigns for this note, it has my writing on it. HENRY BUCKERIDGE . I am an officer of St. Mary-le-bone; about a quarter before eight o'clock, I had information of this robbery. Puddiford had a dog which he said belonged to one of the party who robbed him, that he met that party in Mary-le-bone-lane, and the officer refused to take charge of him; one Harrison said I should know more about it to-morrowCross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He charged an officer with being the thief - A. Yes, he said as he came from the watch-house, that he met three men in Mary-le-bone-lane, that the dog he had was following the men, one of them was the party who robbed him, I understood him to say the man who robbed him was an officer, and that the watchman refused to take charge of him, he said the dog belonged to the men, all three were police-officers he believed, but he gave them in charge to the watchman, who refused to take them, and the man who be charged with the robbery ran away, WILLIAM PUDDIFORD . There was a dog with the gig, I was in Mary-le-bone-lane; three men were before me and a dog. I said that was the dog. and perhaps the man might be there.HOWSE Defence. He asked if I would give him a ride, I said, I had no objection, the landlord said he should have no more to drink, as he had had enough, we got into the gig and had a cloth over our knees, we ran the gig over a heap of stones, I stepped out but having hold of the reins, got in again and asked for the whip which was lost, we left the prosecutor in the gig while we went back to look for it, and when we returned he was standing out of the gig, and said he had lost 60 l. then said 45 l. that it was a 10 l. note and four fives, I said that was only 30 l. he then said, he had lost none at all, he would go no further, and we drove on thirty yards, turned back and asked if he thought we had his money, the watchman said it should be settled, I said I would stop there for nobody; he sprang his rattle - ; the horse took fright, and by Baker-street, Bull got out.BULL'S Defence was precisely to the same effect. JOHN DAVIS . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. A brother officer was returning with me and met a friend; we were all three in Mary-le-bone lane; the prosecutor ran up, and laid hold of my friend. The watchman came and said,""This man says you are one of the persons who robbed him."" My friend stood in the crowd afterwards, and the prosecutor did not know him; and at the office he told the people an officer was in the gig with him. NOT GUILTY .",notGuilty,none

ALLEY conducted the Prosecution. HENRY GOLDSMITH , Esq. I reside on my estate at Crickoel, South Wales. I came to town on the 9th of November, and lodged at the Hummums; but on Monday, the 18th, when this happened, I was lodging in Norfolk-street, I was out walking with two ladies, and returned with them to Norfolk-street, Strand, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. I went in, and we were sitting down to lunch, and all at once a person, whom I should know again, knocked at the door, and said a man in Howard-street wanted to speak to me. I went round the corner, and saw the prisoner - I am certain of him. He said to me,""Sir, do you recollect being in the coach with me on Saturday week?"" I said,""Me! in a coach with you! I was 160 miles from London."" Upon which he said,""Then I will accuse you of an unnatural crime, if you will not give me 10 l.; and you cannot get off, for I saw you go into the Hummums on Wednesday night, and I will therefore accuse you of it on that night."" Upon which I said,""You filthy beast!"" and endeavoured to seize him. I did not then see the person who brought the message. Before I endeavoured to seize him, he said,""If you do not give me the 10 l., you shall have plenty of our sort after you."" I endeavoured to seize him, and he ran away as hard as he could down Surrey-street. I followed, calling stop thief, but nobody would assist me, till I at last gave the people to understand, as well as I could, that he had charged mewith an unnatural crime; then plenty followed him. He ran down the steps into the river, jumped into the mud. I saw him secured. He was almost covered with mud up to his breast. I then said to him,""You have accused me with an unnatural crime, and I shall take you to Bow-street."" He turned round in the presence of the people, and said,""I have no charge to make against you whatever, Sir, except that you met me in the street, and told me that you was a pawnbroker's clerk, and promised to get me a situation, and desired me to call at No. 8, Norfolk-street;"" - which is all false, for I never saw him before in my life. He was taken to Bow-street and committed. He appeared to have a slight impediment in his speech, but not much.Prisoner. Q. Can you positively swear that I said I would charge you with an unnatural crime - A. On my oath he did. GEORGE HEATH , JUN. I am a waterman, and stood at the bottom of Surrey-street. I saw the prisoner running, and Mr. Goldsmid pursuing him. There was a cry of Stop thief. On seeing me he ran into the mud - if I had not been in the way, he could have run into Strand-lane. Mr. Goldsmid came down and told me what was the matter, and ran round to intercept him. I ran into the mud, and secured him. I asked what made him run away - he said he had done nothing; he was no thief. I brought him to Mr. Goldsmid; he then said Mr. Goldsmid had promised to get him a place; Mr. Goldsmid denied having any knowledge of him before, and said he had charged him with an unnatural crime. The prisoner said it was all false. He spoke very well at first, but afterwards stuttered a good deal. JOHN HUGGINS . I live in Howard-street. I heard a dreadful cry of Stop thief; ran up stairs; came out and saw a mob running down Surrey-street; the prisoner was brought out of the mud; his clothes were muddy up to his arms. Mr. Goldsmid said he had charged him with an unnatural crime; he said he had made no such charge.Prisoner's Defence. On the 13th of November I met a gentleman, who asked the way to Covent Garden-market. I shewed him the way; he asked what I was - I said I wanted a situation; he said if I came to the Hummums he would get me one. I went in after him, and asked the waiter his name - He said Goldsmid. I went on Monday; the waiter said he was gone to live at No. 8 Norfolk-street. I had a friend with me, and sent him to ask him to speak for me, as I was not able. The gentleman came out; I asked if he had heard of a situation - He said""You do not know me."" I said he had promised to get me one; I was leaving him, and there was a cry of Stop thief. I went down by the water to see what was the matter, slipped into the mud, and somebody collared me. GUILTY . Aged 17. Transported for Seven Years .",guilty,none

I consented, and saw no more of him. On the 24th I had a bill to take up at Sir John Lubbock 's, and paid this in part; it was taken in payment. I did not see him till November, when he was brought to my shop, and said""You will not do any thing with me, Mr. Birt you will get your money.""Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. He did not offer to give you the cheque till you requested security - A. No, he merely left it in my possession, and never gave me authority to present it. I have not received the goods back.

I find from inquiry that no such person keeps cash there; the usual method is to pass the cheque to another clerk, who cancels it if it is good; it was objected to the same evening, and returned in the morning.Q. Can you positively say no such person keeps cash at your house - A. I only speak from inquiry which I have made of the senior clerks. JOHN JOHNSON . I am an officer. On the 7th of November I was fetched to Birt's shop; the prisoner was there. Birt shewed me the cheque. I asked the prisoner if the name at the bottom of it was his - he said no, and that he did not know the person he took it of. SARAH GROVE . My husband is houseman at Shoreditch watch-house. I went to clean the watch-house when the prisoner was there, and behind a large door I found a cheque book. SAMUEL ANDREWS . I am shopman to Mr. Birt.

I apprehended the prisoner, and took him on Monday to the building, where the opening had been made, and fitted his shoes to the foot marks on the ground; there were three impressions particularly deep, and all of the same size. I told him to put his foot into them, and it fitted exactly. There were no nails in the shoe.Cross-examined. Q. Why not take his shoe off and compare it - A. I thought it fairer for him to put his foot in, as he might say I disturbed the mark. He did not object to it. They were right and left marks, and of a common size. I said it was very odd your shoes fit this mark exactly. He made no reply. It was a stiff clay soil.Prisoner's Defence. I left work about six o'clock as usual, and took the keys to my master's house, and staid there till twenty minutes past eight; then went and had a glass of gin, and went to Little Coram-street; remained there till half-past eleven. I had a swollen face, and a handkerchief over it. I then went to the Marquis of Cornwallis public-house, and then to bed; and on Monday morning about eleven, when I was at work, a man came, and said Scott and the officer had been after me. I went over to Scott, but he was not there. I returned to work, and between two and three o'clock the officer came. He took me to the building, and put my feet into the marks; they did not fit by half an inch at the toe, but he said they were a good fit. I said they did not by half an inch. JOHN STAPLES . He said nothing about his feet not fitting then, but told the magistrate they did not by half an inch. WILLIAM KING . I live in Park-street, and am a carpenter. The prisoner is my apprentice.

I could not seewhat it was; she went out; my master followed her and brought her back; the lawn was not then on the floor, for I had just passed the place.

On Monday, the 11th of November, when Hunt came to town, I was in Pall Mall, about half-past twelve o'clock, there was a great crowd - my watch was in my fob; the outside case was gold. I stood on the step of a public-house at the corner of John-street, and in four or five minutes a man (who had hold of Marks came up.) and asked if I had lost anything; I felt and missed my watch - there were a great many people about the door. It was sent to me on the Friday following in a brown paper parcel; I do not know who from. THOMAS HARRIS . I am a constable of St. Pancras. I was in Pall Mall, and saw the prisoners in company together, at the door of the Goat, public-house.

I forced myself in, and asked Mr. Cotton if he had lost anything; I had seen nothing taken, I only suspected - he said his watch was gone. Marks stood next to him I assisted in securing him.

I could not see his hands. I can swear I never saw him take anything; he might take it without my seeing him - I was about a yard from him, behind.

When I took Marks into the room, he said,""You may depend upon it you have got the wrong man"" - I told him to mind his own business; he said he stood behind and was certain he saw him do nothing, and it was a pity a man should be lugged away in that manner.
