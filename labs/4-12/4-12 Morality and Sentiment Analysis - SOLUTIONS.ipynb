stairs  i delivered them to him before mary perry   i then put on my great coat to go to my labour at the london docks  when mary perry came to me and said  that she had not experienced an  moment s of conjugal felicity that she had a right to expect  that scarcely a night had passed but only with sighs and tears  and as i had been out of employ  and had a quantity of clothes at the pawnbrokers

guineas out of my hand and said  she would have it for her own use  i went out with the boy  and took him to a house in the borough  and on the next day i returned  i sent for mary perry   she asked me  how much money i had left  i had a suit of clothes that i had taken out by her desire  i told her  on my answer  she flew into a great rage  and instantly sent for an officer  and i was taken in

stated  this is the first time that my character has been attacked  i have honourably served his majesty twenty seven years  as the letter annexed will prove  i sincerely hope the verdict of the jury will answer my most anxious expectations q  now mrs  perry you have heard what has been read by that letter  did you deliver this money to him for any such consideration as that expressed there    a  no  i gave it him merely upon his representing to me  that he was to take this money  with the boy  to the captain q  and all that  you swear is a fiction    a  yes  guilty   aged 43  transported for

constable   a  yes  i apprehended the prisoner  the first word he said when i got hold of him was  let me go  directly after  he said  he did not mean to go away  when we got into saffron hill  he

look at the deposition that you made before the magistrate  and see whether you recollet every thing you see what you said there is that true   a  it is  i omitted saying he would give him a good wapping  and she had been out all night  that account is perfectly true  i recollect it now prisoner s defence  i was seeking after her  i cannot say whether what they say against me is so or not  i

more came up to me and said d   n your bloody eyes let the prisoner go   i am positive to the man  he said  the lady has got her watch  and what does she want more  i told him i would not let him go untill i put the prisoner trueman into a prison  and the person that had got the watch  said  he would not deliver the watch up untill he delivered it to a magistrate  or to an officer  i then sent for a constable  and for the lady s friend griffin  the constable came in  about three quarters of an hour after that  trueman said he would go quietly with griffin and me  the prisoner was present  and very abusive  because i would not let trueman go  when we came to the corner of hosier lane  i had old of trueman s right arm in my left  and i had hold of his coat and waistcoat with my right

wrestling with griffin to get his staff from him  trueman and a number of others at the time said  d   n their bloody eyes  hamstring them  i was then got very near the george with trueman  i was so overpowered at that time  i said if they would let me go  i would let trueman go  they said  d   n your bloody eyes let him go  we ll let you go   i immediately heard a voice behind say  throw him backwards   i turned round and saw a person at a small folding doors to a large gateway  i then threw trueman s heels up  threw him in that door  and fell in with him  i took trueman into the back part of the george public house  the prisoner at the bar came in at the same time  and bray  griffin  and huggins q  had you seen the prisoner during the whole of this time    a  i saw the prisoner when he insisted upon me letting trueman go in the public house  before i had not seen him from that time to this  griffin then got a cord and tied trueman s hands behind him  i had hold of trueman  the prisoner came and stood opposite of me  the prisoner called for a pint of ale  he gave trueman the first glass of ale out of his pint  he said  here my lad  drink   after trueman drank he said  he wished somebody would go and let his friends know where he was   the landlord of the house said if you will give me proper directions  i will go and let your friends know  the prisoner said  you have no occasion to give yourself that trouble  trueman is a stranger to me  i will let them know   after the prisoner had called for a pint of beer and a pipe  i said  as you pretend to be a friend to this man  why do not you go and let his friends know   he said he would stop and see the coach off first  the landlord of the house then shook his head  and seemed to think he was one of the gang  a coach came q  who got into the coach    a  i  trueman  griffin  and bray  i cannot tell exactly how many there might be  and the prisoner followed us out of the house  and after the coach  as soon as we got out of the door they gave a shout  when we got into the middle of smithfield  the coach door was broken open on the left hand side  i then received four or five blows on my left thigh with a stick  i then looked at the coach door  i saw the prisoner at the coach door with a stick  i then asked some one to lend me their stick to defend myself  but they wanted it back again in a moment  and i delivered it to them  i then put my hand out to hold the door by the tassel  and received a blow on my arm  i got the coach door to  and held it by the tassel and the pocket  we proceeded  the coach was stopped several times before we got to newgate street  there were a number of voices at the time cry our  d   n your eyes you bloody b   s  we ll rescue him   i cannot say the prisoner was one

the reins  and the harness werecut  the coachman was obliged to get off his box  to get one of the horses  the reins were cut  he had not gone many yards before the body of the coach fell down between the wheels  the main braces were cut  with that  one or two people in the coach left me  griffin  and the prisoner in the coach  bray who had jumped out of the coach  returned in a few minutes and said  oh griffin my arm is broke   griffin immediately jumped out of the coach  left me and trueman together in the coach  trueman began to cry at that time  and said  he was a lost man   he was very sorry for what had happened  just at that moment the prisoner came up to the coach door  he said something  i could not rightly understand what  he had not been at the door above a minute or two before stanton the officer came up  i heard stanton say  the first man that came near the coach  he would blow his brains out   he had got a pair of pistols  i then said  blow that man s brains out   which is the prisoner at the bar  or drive him away  with that he put a pistol to his breast  and told him  if he did not go away he would blow his brains out   i told him he was the man that wanted to rescue trueman  he immediately went away  we got trueman into a fresh coach  and returned to giltspur street compter  we could not go forward to the poultry compter  it might be near ten o clock

horses  in smithfield  the coachman got on one of his horses and rode as postillion  untill we got into newgate street  they found they could not get the prisoner out of the coach  they cut the braces of the spring  and let the body of the coach down  i jumped out of the coach immediately  and pike the officer  as we jumped out of the coach  there was a most desperate gang  some with knives  and some with sticks  one of them hit me on my head by the side of my ear  and knocked me down with a large stick  i was fighting at that time for about ten minutes  the other officer ran away and left me at the coach door  i dare say i was knocked down a dozen times q  how many were there assembled together    a  i dare say near twenty  some beating me over my legs  and some over my thighs  they were armed with sticks and knives  they said  d   n your b   y eyes  let him go  one of them cut me on the fingers  on this hand  with a knife  another came up and hit me on my arm with a large driver s

the second time q  the first time he came up to the coach door  how near was that to bray s coming up and saying he was cut    a  a few minutes mr  knapp  i do not understand you  to say at that time when bray came up and said he was cut  and his arm broke  you did not see the prisoner then    a  no  i did not see him at the coach door q  at that time that bray informed you  did you see him at the

the coach  when the coach went away  sadler followed the coach from the george  and about an hundred yards from the george  in smithfield  i saw the prisoner stop the horses  after having stopped the horses  he went of the near side of the coach  and tried to open the coach door  he could not get it open  then the coachman drove on very hard  he directly ran before the horses again  just as the coach got opposite of the hospital gates  he stopped the horses the second time  after that  the coachman found the reins were cut  he directly hollowed out  his reins were cut   after that  the coachman got into newgate street  i heard the prisoner say  to four or five of them  now  my boys  stick true to me  and we will have them away from the b   rs  q  how many persons were there following of him    a  near upon thirty of them from what i could see in the gang  a great many had sticks and knives q  i think you say you saw the prisoner twice at the horses heads    a  i did  and likewise in newgate street  after he made that expression to four or five of them  he went to the off side of the coach  and directly the coach fell down   it was instantly cut down  after he came up to the coach door  i heard stanton say  if you do not go away i will blow your brains out   after that i lost sight of him  i heard bray say he had his arm broke  i did not see him struck  i am quite

halfway down newgate street  i saw a mob  i quickened my pace  and got up to it  it was a great mob  indeed  i tried to go through the mob  some cried out  do not let him go through   i pulled a pair of pistols out of my pocket  and swore the first person that offered to stop me  i would blow his brains out  they pushed me backwards and forwards  they would not let me go through  when i got to the horses heads  i was tried to be stopped by a man  i did not exactly notice that man  i got to the coach door  there were some trying to open the coach door  i pushed them of one side  and looked in the coach window  i saw griffin  i said  what is the matter   he said  for god s sake assist us   i said i would  lloyd said  stanton  blow that man s brains out  if he does not go away from the coach   he said    that man has been following of us all the while   the prisoner is the man  to the best that i can recollect  i have no doubt about it  that is the man that tried to shove me under the coach  when i was endeavouring to get at the coach door  the pistols were locked  i unlocked one  and presented the pistol to him  and told him  if he did not go away  i would blow his brains out  i never saw any more of him  he went away q  are you sure that is the man that attempted to push you under the coach    a  yes  i have no doubt at all of it q  and the man that was pointed out to you    a  i have no doubt of it  it was very dark  i saw him by the light of the lamps  i got another coach and put trueman in  and then i saw bray s hand was cut by something sharp  daniel leadbetter   i am

and this adjoining room is the butler s pantry  where the prisoner went with carrÃ¢  they were there about half an hourÃ¢  lord russell soon after returned in a hackney cab  about twenty minutes to six o clockÃ¢  i went to the pantry door and said   courvoisier  his lordship has been obliged to come home in a cab Ã¢  he then went up and let his lordship inÃ¢  he went into the dining room  which is on the groundfloor  immediately over the kitchenÃ¢  his lordship soon after rang the bell  the prisoner went up  and afterwards came  down with a letter in his handÃ¢  he told me he was going to

would take him to go to the stableÃ¢  he returned down the area stepsÃ¢  he told me in the pantry that his lordship seemed angry when he first came in  but he got quite good tempered afterÃ¢  the prisoner brought in a dog of his lordship s when he came from the stableÃ¢  lord russell then went out with his dog for a walk  as it was his custom to do every dayÃ¢  he returned about half past six o clockÃ¢  the prisoner was soon after employed in making arrangements for lord russell s dinnerÃ¢  seven o clock was the dinner hourÃ¢  about seven o clock a bellhanger came to fasten the handle of the door of lord russell s roomÃ¢  the prisoner requested me to go up with that workman  and i did soÃ¢  he was not in the house more than five or ten minutesÃ¢  i did not go down stairs with himÃ¢  he went out by the areaÃ¢  he mended the handle of the doorÃ¢  lord russell dined at home alone in the dining room on the ground floorÃ¢  he was waited upon by the prisonerÃ¢  he afterwards went up into the back drawing roomÃ¢  he used to go up there to writeÃ¢  i left him there when i went to bedÃ¢  he did not come down again to my knowledgeÃ¢  the coachman came in a little before nine o clock to fetch the dogÃ¢  i saw nothing more of the coachman that eveningÃ¢  the prisoner and i supped together that evening  a little before nine o clockÃ¢  the cook had gone outÃ¢  during supper the prisoner and i had some conversation about change of servants  about a new cook coming into the houseÃ¢  the cook was going away  and a new cook expectedÃ¢  a friend of mine had applied for the placeÃ¢  the prisoner said  if his lordship did not take that friend he should not recommend any one himselfÃ¢  another person had appliedÃ¢  he said he wished he had not come into bis lordship s service  as he did not like it so well as he thought he shouldÃ¢  nothing else passedÃ¢  nothing was said about richmond that eveningÃ¢  on the 22nd of april  the day lord russell came to london  the prisoner said his lordship had been very cross and peevish  as they had changed his room three times while he was stopping at the castle at richmondÃ¢  i told him that must have been the reason that his lordship was angryÃ¢  he said his lordship had lost a locket while they were at richmondÃ¢  he said he did not know how it was lost he could not find itÃ¢  he said he did not know how the late valet could have stopped so long with his lordship  he did not think his temper would allow him to stop so longÃ¢  some time after he said he must write to the porter at richmond about the locketÃ¢  he did not say what porterÃ¢  it was not many days before the 5th of may that he said thatÃ¢  i think it was about between the 22nd of april and the 5th of mayÃ¢  i never heard him say any thing after that about the locketÃ¢  on the evening in question the cook returned soon after ten o clockÃ¢  the prisoner let her inÃ¢  she came in at the front doorÃ¢  after the cook came in the prisoner went out to fetch her a pint of porterÃ¢  he went out by the area gateÃ¢  he was only gone a few minutesÃ¢  there is a public house close byÃ¢  when he returned with the porter i do not know whether he locked the area gate or notÃ¢  i did not see him bring in any thing but the porterÃ¢  he made no observation about itÃ¢  the area gate was generally kept unlocked in the dayÃ¢  it was either the prisoner s or the cook s duty to fasten itÃ¢  the key used to hang on a nail in the kitchenÃ¢  i do not remember to have seen the key in the kitchen after he came in with the porterÃ¢  i left the kitchen a few minutes after ten o clock to go to bedÃ¢  it might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterÃ¢  i slept in the front room  third floor  immediately over the room in which lord russell sleptÃ¢  the cook slept in the same roomÃ¢  we slept in two separate bedsÃ¢  the room in which we slept had a lumber room taken off from itÃ¢  my bed was against the window  and the cook s against the doorÃ¢  i should have to pass the cook s bed in going to or returning from mineÃ¢  it was my duty before i went to bed to light a fire in lord russell s bed roomÃ¢  i did so that nightÃ¢  after lighting it i went up to my own bed roomÃ¢  there is a door at the foot of the stairs leading from the landing by lord russell s door to the room where i and the cook sleptÃ¢  the prisoner slept in the back room  third floor  next to oursÃ¢  every thing appeared to me in the usual state in lord russell s room when i lighted the fire  the same as on other nightsÃ¢  the room immediately joining lord russell s bed room was not usedÃ¢  it is a sort of lumber roomÃ¢  there is a door from that room leading into lord russell s roomÃ¢  the door which opened from the landing had a spring on it which caused it to close of itselfÃ¢  the opening and closing of that door made no noise  without it was shut hardÃ¢  the door at the foot of the stairs leading up to our room shut easilyÃ¢  the door of lord russell s bedroom was covered with baizeÃ¢  the door at the foot of the stairs had a common latch  and had no coveringÃ¢  that door was sometimes closed at night  and sometimes left openÃ¢  the cook came up stairs about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after meÃ¢  i was in bed when she came upÃ¢  she went to bed q  did you  or the cook to your knowledge leave that bed room any more that night  a  no  i heard no noise  nor was i disturbed by any thing in the course of the nightÃ¢  it would be the prisoner s duty to remain up below till his lordship went to bedÃ¢  the fire was left burning in the kitchen  and a supply of coals leftÃ¢  the cook used to attend to the fireÃ¢  at the time i went to bed lord russell was in the back drawing roomÃ¢  i saw a light in the back drawing room as i went up stairs  and a little before that i heard the back drawing room bell ringÃ¢  i awoke about half past six o clock next morningÃ¢  the cook was then in bed asleepÃ¢  half past six o clock was about the time i usually got upÃ¢  as i was going down stairs from my own room i knocked at the prisoner s bed room doorÃ¢  i was accustomed to do thatÃ¢  i did not hear any answer given to my knockÃ¢  i found the door at the foot of the attic stairs slightly openÃ¢  i noticed the warming pan on the landingadjoining lord russell s roomÃ¢  it was lying on the landing with the handle nearest to the bed room doorÃ¢  it laid across the door that would go into the back room which was not usedÃ¢  you would have to step over the warming pan to get into the back room q  did it leave the passage to and from lord russell s room uninterrupted  a  yesÃ¢  it was the prisoner s duty to warm his lordship s bed every nightÃ¢  the warming pan was generally taken down into the kitchen afterwardsÃ¢  during the five weeks the prisoner was in the service the bed had been warmed every night when his lordship was in townÃ¢  once before the warming pan had been left on the landingÃ¢  i spoke to him about it  and told him it was not the proper place to leave itÃ¢  i do not remember how long before the 5th of may that wasÃ¢  i think it was before lord russell went to richmondÃ¢  i left it there on this occasion  and went into the backroom adjoining his lordship s bed roomÃ¢  i was not in that room a momentÃ¢  i went in there for my broomÃ¢  i did not observe whether the door between that and lord russell s room was closed or notÃ¢  i then went down stairs into the back drawing room  where i had left his lordship the night beforeÃ¢  i noticed his lordship s writing desk turned roundÃ¢  it is what is called a davenport desk  with a sloping top which lifts upÃ¢  four drawers were open  and the top jammed up with papersÃ¢  i observed his lordship s bunch of keys and several of his papers lying on the hearth rugÃ¢  i noticed a screw driver lying on his lordship s writing chairÃ¢  i had seen that in the butler s pantry a few days before  in a bottom cupboard next the fire  in a little tool boxÃ¢  i had seen it there two or three days beforeÃ¢  the tool box is one that the late valet hadÃ¢  it belonged to the placeÃ¢  i did not notice any thing in the front drawing roomÃ¢  i opened the front drawing room shuttersÃ¢  i then went down stairs  and into this passageÃ¢   pointing it out on the model Ã¢  when i got into the passage  i saw a number of things lying behind the street door  which was shutÃ¢  i went up to the doorÃ¢  it had no fastening but the latchÃ¢  any body from the outside could open it with a latch keyÃ¢  there were two bolts to the door  top and bottom  a double lock  and a chain  besides the latch q  what did you first notice when you came down  a  i saw a number of things lying against the doorÃ¢  i was then at the bottom of the stairsÃ¢  i then went up to the door and noticed bis lordship s large blue cloakÃ¢  that was part of the number of thingsÃ¢  it was not lying very close to the doorÃ¢  a little distance from it  was his lordship s opera glass  a little trinket box lying on the top  and a number of things tied up in a napkin  which i did not examine at that time Ã¢  that was lying a little nearer the door than the cloakÃ¢  the cloak was folded up very neatlyÃ¢  i did not at that time notice any other articleÃ¢  i examined the things after the police came into the houseÃ¢  there was his lordship s gold pencil case  a gold tooth pick and caseÃ¢  the pencil case was in the folds of the napkin  and the tooth pickcase alsoÃ¢  there was also a silver sugar dredger  a little silver caddy spoon  a silver top of a salt dredger  a pair of his lordship s spectacles  tipped with silver  a little cayenne spoon  a top of a silver dish cover  and the cook s silver thimbleÃ¢  i knew the napkin to be the same that i had given out on the monday for his lordship s dinnerÃ¢  i had seen it on the tuesday  just before the prisoner went to lay the cloth in the pantryÃ¢  i asked the prisoner if he wanted a clean oneÃ¢  he said no  he would make it do twice q  where were these things usually kept  a  the cloak was kept in the dining room  on the last chair against the windowÃ¢  the opera glass in hislordship s bed room  on the shelf over the fire place  the little trinket case  to the best of my belief  was kept in his dressing case  but i am not certain  the gold pencil case and tooth pick his lordship generally carried about with him  and generally put them on a small table in his bed room at nightÃ¢  he had three pairs of spectaclesÃ¢  i do not know where he kept themÃ¢  the silver dredger was kept in the cupboard next to the fire in the pantry  and the caddy spoon  and silver top of the coverÃ¢  the dish cover was kept in a cupboard in the sideboard in the dining roomÃ¢  the other part of the dish was also kept thereÃ¢  the prisoner had the key of that cupboardÃ¢  i do not know whether it was locked or notÃ¢  when i went up to the street door i did not examine it  but just looked at itÃ¢  i set the dining room door open and saw a number of things lying on the floorÃ¢  the shutters were closed  and i set the door open to give me light  as i felt alarmed seeing those things  and then i went and opened the shuttersÃ¢  after i had opened the shutters  i saw the candlesticksÃ¢  i do not know whether they were plated or silverÃ¢  some were plated and some silverÃ¢  the bottom of the dish cover and some sugar was on the floorÃ¢  all the drawers and cupboard doors were openÃ¢  i felt dreadfully alarmed  and ran up stairs to tell the cookÃ¢  i found her in bedÃ¢  i said something to herÃ¢  she made me an answerÃ¢  in consequence of what she said i went to the door of the prisoner s roomÃ¢  i said   courvoisier  do you know of any thing being the matter last night   Ã¢  he said    no Ã¢  his room door was shutÃ¢  it was opened instantly by him q  how long elapsedÃ¢Å“  between your first knocking at the door to awake him  and your going and knocking and speaking to him  a  i should say ten minutesÃ¢  when he opened the door he was dressed all but his coatÃ¢  he used to wash in the pantry belowÃ¢  he was dressed in the usual way that morning  except his coatÃ¢  he used to put his coat on before he came downÃ¢  i did not notice any thing but his waistcoatÃ¢  that was the same he generally woreÃ¢  he had his shoes onÃ¢  sometimes i have seen him come down without shoes  and sometimes with themÃ¢  he generally came down stairs dressedÃ¢  on his opening the door  i said   do you know what has been the matter last night   Ã¢  he said   no Ã¢  i said   all your silver and things are about Ã¢  he looked very pale and agitatedÃ¢  he did not make me any answerÃ¢  he came out of his room  and put his coat on as he was going down the attic stairsÃ¢  he went down instantly  i with himÃ¢  he went down firstÃ¢  he took the warming pan down in his hand to the dining roomÃ¢  it was my custom to call the prisoner of a morningÃ¢  he was never so short a time dressing as that morningÃ¢  he was sometimes half an hour  sometimes threequarters  and sometimes an hourÃ¢  the first room he went into was the dining room  and there he left the warming panÃ¢  i did not hear him say any thing thenÃ¢  he then went down stairs into his own pantryÃ¢  there is a door near the pantry which opens into the back areaÃ¢  i did not notice whether that was open or shutÃ¢  he went into his pantryÃ¢  i followed himÃ¢  there is a cupboard there and drawers  they were all openÃ¢  he made up to the drawers first  and said   my god  some one has been robbing us Ã¢  i said   let us go up stairs Ã¢  we both went up stairs  i think as far as the passage  and then i said   for god s sake let us go and see where his lordship is Ã¢  we went up stairsÃ¢  he went firstÃ¢  i followed him close behindÃ¢  he went into his lordship s bed room by the cloth doorÃ¢  the door closed upon me  but i had the handle in my hand  and went in immediately afterÃ¢  when you go in at the door there are three windows fronting the street opposite the doorÃ¢  the head of the bed is against the wall on the righthand as you go inÃ¢  when i went in  the prisoner was opening the shutters of the middle windowÃ¢  he would have to pass the foot of the bed to do thatÃ¢  i went about half way to the middle of the bed  at the foot of the bed  and saw blood on the pillowÃ¢  before i noticed the blood  i said   my lord  my lord Ã¢  the prisoner said   here he is    or  there he is    i am not certain which were the wordsÃ¢  i cannot say whether that was before or after i saw the blood on the pillowÃ¢  on seeing the blood i screamed and ran out of the roomÃ¢  there were hangings to the bedÃ¢  it was a four post bedsteadÃ¢  the curtains were closed on the side next the door  and about half way at the foot  the same as i bad left them over nightÃ¢  i left the prisoner in the room  and i think i ran part of the way up the attic stairs  and then i turned round  and ran down into the street q  had you any object in going up the attic stairs  a  i was going to my fellow servant the cook  when i thought i would give an alarm out in  the street  and my screams awoke herÃ¢  i left the house by the street door  and went over to no  23  mr  latham s  and rang the bellÃ¢  it is nearly oppositeÃ¢  finding they did not come instantly  1Ã¢Å“  rang the bell at no  22  mr  lloyd s  and the footman came up the area steps immediatelyÃ¢  i do not know his nameÃ¢  young  mr  latham s servant  came out while i was standing at the doorÃ¢  i told him what had occurredÃ¢  i had left the front door of the house open when i ran outÃ¢  i was not gone many minutes  i merely crossed the street  rang these two bells  and came back againÃ¢  when i came back to the house i think i met the cook at the bottom of the stairs in the passageÃ¢  i am not positiveÃ¢  i then went into the dining roomÃ¢  i do not know whether she followed me or notÃ¢  at that time no stranger had come into the houseÃ¢  when i went into the dining room i found the prisoner sitting on a chair in the act of writingÃ¢  he hadÃ¢Å“  a pen in his hand and a small piece of paper lying on a large bookÃ¢  he appeared to be writing on that small piece of paperÃ¢  i said   what the devil do you sit here for  why don t you go out and see for some one  or a doctor    he said   i must write to mr  russell Ã¢  he did not continue writingÃ¢  he only wrote about two wordsÃ¢  i said   some one must go for mr  russell Ã¢  i knew him to mean the son of lord william russellÃ¢  he lived at no  9  cheshunt place  belgrave squareÃ¢  on my saying that  the prisoner got up and came to the street doorÃ¢  a sort of labouring man was going past  and the prisoner beckoned to himÃ¢  i told him not to call such a man as that  and the man went on about his businessÃ¢  the coachman came a few minutes after  and young  mr  latham s servant  about the same timeÃ¢  i think the coachman was in the house firstÃ¢  the coachman and young went up stairsÃ¢  i am not sure whether i went up with them  i am not positive sureÃ¢  i do not know what i did at that momentÃ¢  i think i didÃ¢  i think the cook went to the bed room doorÃ¢  i do not know where the prisoner wasÃ¢  i heard young say something about fetching a doctorÃ¢  i was on the stairsÃ¢  i went down and was going to send some one for a doctor  when the coachman ran for mr  elsgood  a surgeon in the neighbourhoodÃ¢  the police arrived a very few minutes after thatÃ¢  i went up stairs when the police arrived  into the bed roomÃ¢  when i went in i saw his lordship s face at that time  and i saw a quantity of bloodÃ¢  i was in the habit of making the bedÃ¢  his lordship usually laid on the side next the windowÃ¢  there were two pillowsÃ¢  they were usually put side by side  as if for two personsÃ¢  the pillows were in that state when i saw them that morningÃ¢  his lordship laid on his right side with his face towards the windowÃ¢  he was lying with his head on the pillow  nearest the window  and the other pillow was lying behind himÃ¢  it was on the pillow next the window  on which i first saw the blood when i went into the room with the prisonerÃ¢  when i went up with the police i did not notice whether there was blood on the other pillowÃ¢  there was a dressing table in the roomÃ¢  it is the one on which lord russell used to put his pencil case and tooth pickÃ¢  it had a white cloth on itÃ¢  he generally used to leave his rings  which he wore daily  on the tableÃ¢  they were fiveÃ¢  i had frequently seen them there of a morningÃ¢  his lordship would frequently go down to breakfast and leave them thereÃ¢  there were no rings or toothpick  or pencil case there thenÃ¢  they were all goneÃ¢  there was a purse thereÃ¢  i took it upÃ¢  it was emptyÃ¢  the police then took possession of the house  and have remained in it to the present time q  have you ever had conversation with the prisoner on the subject of money  a  yesÃ¢  the last time was on the tuesday morning  the 5thÃ¢  he said he had no money at home  he never took any out with him  and he had no money in the bankÃ¢  i do not exactly remember what led to that conversationÃ¢  he afterwards said he had 8l  some odd shillings in the bankÃ¢  that was on the same day  in the same conversationÃ¢  when he first said he had no money in the bank i did not make any observationÃ¢  he said all the money he had then was 5l   when that was gone he must ask his lordship for some more  and that he had 8l  owing him on the books against his lordshipÃ¢  nothing passed between the time of his saying he had no money in the bank and his saying that he had money in the bankÃ¢  the cook was present q  do you remember whether any thing passed between you  after having first said he had no money  and then saying he had  a  i said to him   have you spent all that money i saw you take out   Ã¢  he said   yes Ã¢  i do not know how that conversation beganÃ¢  it was at breakfastÃ¢  i had seen him take some sovereigns out of his box when he came up into his bed room  and i was in my bed room  and he had some sovereigns in his hand  which he put into his waistcoat pocketÃ¢  i cannot say whether this was on monday or tuesdayÃ¢  that is what i meant by asking him what he had done with the money i had seen him take outÃ¢   i do not know how many there were Ã¢  he said he had  for he had paid a tailor s billÃ¢  this was on the tuesdayÃ¢  it was his own tailor s bill q  which was mentioned first  having money in the bank  or paying his tailor s bill  a  having money in the bank was mentioned firstÃ¢  i asked him what bankÃ¢  he said in st  martin s laneÃ¢  i believe there is a savings  bank thereÃ¢  i told him that was the best bank he could put it inÃ¢  i do not think he said any thing more at that timeÃ¢  he said he was not so well off as when he first came to englandÃ¢  i think he said that before that timeÃ¢  he said it once before  and he said it again at tea time  when carr was there on the tuesday eveningÃ¢  he said on the tuesday morning that he had but 5l court q  did he say where the 5l  was  a  no  he said he had but 5l mr  bodkin q  can you tell us whether he said he had but 5l  before or after he said he had the 8l  odd in the bank  a  i think it was before he said he had the 8l  in the bankÃ¢  i never saw him in possession of any money of his own  but the sovereigns which i have mentionedÃ¢  i never saw him with any bank note q  did he ever speak to you  or in your hearing  on the subject oflord william russell s property  a  yes  on two occasions  i heard speak of thatÃ¢  the first occasion was before his lordship went to richmondÃ¢  he said old billywas a rum old chap  and if he had his money he would not remain long in englandÃ¢  i said his lordship was not a very rich manÃ¢  he said   ah  old billyhas money  and if i had it i would not remain long in england Ã¢  the next occasion was before the tuesday  but i do not know how longÃ¢  it was after he returned from richmondÃ¢  that was on the same subjectÃ¢  he said the same words as before q  do you mean to the same effect  or the same words  a  the same wordsÃ¢  i was alone with the prisoner at supper the night before the murderÃ¢  i had a glass of aleÃ¢  he offered me a glass of something  which i tasted  but did not drinkÃ¢  he drank the same ale i didÃ¢  in the course of the day on the 6th  i asked the prisoner if he heard me knock at his doorÃ¢  he said he thought he would begin to dressÃ¢  he did not say whether he heard me or notÃ¢  i have frequently seen the prisoner in his lordship s bed room q  did you notice any thing particular in his conduct at any time  a  yesÃ¢  i did several timesÃ¢  i noticed that he was  looking into all his lordship s property  and every thing that he couldÃ¢  i asked him what he wanted in the rooms  and he told me he was looking after somethingÃ¢  he has not told me whatÃ¢  this was before he went to richmondÃ¢  i cannot mention any article in particular  which he appeared to be looking atÃ¢  on one occasion i noticed that he had his lordship s dressing case down in his pantry q  would it be his duty to have it down there to clean it or any thing  a  i never knew the other valet to have it downÃ¢  i cannot tell any article that he was looking at when he was in his lordship s bed room  because his lordship used to carry the keys  and i never knew his lordship to leave any thing unlocked in the bed room  except his dressing caseÃ¢  it was not only in one room that i saw him looking  but every roomÃ¢  i do not know exactly what property his lordship hadÃ¢  one day his lordship left his cash box unlockedÃ¢  it was the day his lordship went to richmondÃ¢  it was kept in his lordship s bed room  by the side of the bedÃ¢  it was a little box his lordship always called his cash boxÃ¢  it was covered with leatherÃ¢  the prisoner brought it down  and said it was unlockedÃ¢  his lordship was gone out for a walk at that timeÃ¢  the prisoner brought it down into the dining room  because his lordship was going to richmond  and he always took it with himÃ¢  his lordship burnt a rushlight at night in his roomÃ¢  i set one up that nightÃ¢  it was a whole rushlightÃ¢  i left it unlit when i went to bedÃ¢  i have since given one of the rushlights out of the same parcel to inspector beresford cross examined bymr  phillips q  you have been examined  i believe  several times before the magistrate  a  yesÃ¢  i cannot recollect how many timesÃ¢  it was three i believe  but i do not know how many timesÃ¢  i was also examined before the coronerÃ¢  i have not been examined by anybody since the committal of the prisoner  that i swearÃ¢  not by mr  hoblerÃ¢  this is not the first time i have said i saw the prisoner looking not only into one room  but into every room after his lordship s propertyÃ¢  i said it before i ever went to bow street  to the solicitor who was there when first i was examined  i believe it was mr  hoblerÃ¢  i also said it to my fellowservantÃ¢  i have several times told what occurred  without mentioning that i saw him looking after the propertyÃ¢  i gave evidence in the house oflord russell on the first or second day  i am not certain whichÃ¢  i believe what i said was taken down in writingÃ¢  i have no doubt that it wasÃ¢  mr  mayne  the commissioner of police  was thereÃ¢  there was no magistrate present to my knowledgeÃ¢  i never saw himÃ¢  there was no attorney there to my knowledgeÃ¢  i did not see anyÃ¢  there were only two persons  mr  hobler and mr  mayneÃ¢  i did not know mr  hobler was the attorneyÃ¢  i did not know that was the nameÃ¢  the prisoner was not presentÃ¢  when i first went into his lordship s room with the prisoner  i said   my lord  my lord    and saw some blood on the pillow  and ran away screamingÃ¢  i did not see his lordship on that occasion q  now  attend to me  on the oath you have taken  have you never said   i saw my lord murdered in the bed    a  no  sir  i never didÃ¢  i never said his lordship was murdered  the first timeÃ¢  i did not see his lordship when i first went in with the prisonerÃ¢  i never said i did  to my recollectionÃ¢  i really was that frightened  i do not know what i said at the momentÃ¢  i know what i said in the room q  but did you ever represent that when you went the first time into the bed room with courvoisier  you saw my lord murdered in the bed  a  i saw bloodÃ¢  i did not know whether he was murderedÃ¢  i never said that i saw him murdered in the bedÃ¢  i am sure i never didÃ¢  i did not see his lordship the first time q  i am asking what you said  if you said that  on the first occasion when you went in with courvoisier  you saw his lordship murdered in the bed  would that be true or not  a  i do not know whether i said murdered or killedÃ¢  i think i said something to my fellow servantÃ¢  i think it was  killed Ã¢  she says i said either murdered or killed q  i am talking of the time you went in with courvoisier  did you represent to any body that  on the first view of the bed on that occasion  you saw my lord murdered in the bed  a  noÃ¢  i do not think i said itÃ¢  i could not say that  because i never saw my lord thenÃ¢  i did not represent that i did  to my beliefÃ¢  i did not  to my knowledgeÃ¢  i cannot say whether i did or notÃ¢  when i first went in i saw blood on the end of the pillowÃ¢  i said   my lord  my lord    and ran screaming out of the room court q  in giving an account of this afterwards to some other person  was the expression you used that you had seen my lord murdered in his bed  meaning lying in his bed murdered  is that what you said  a  noÃ¢  i recollect it now  i said some one had murdered his lordshipÃ¢  i said it in the street to young mr  phillips q  i am not asking what you said in the street  i ask you this  did you ever say that the first time you went into the room you saw him murdered in the bed  a  noÃ¢  i am sure of thatÃ¢  i was examined before the coronerÃ¢  to the best of my recollection  i have always given the same account of what i saw in the room on the first occasion  as i have given to dayÃ¢  it is a thing which impresses itself on my mindÃ¢  i was that frightened  i do not remember what i sawÃ¢  on the second occasion i went in with inspector tedman  and saw his lordship s faceÃ¢  i did not go up to the side of the bed  i went to about the middle of the foot of the bed  i then saw saw his lordship s faceÃ¢  tedman went up before meÃ¢  i followed him instantlyÃ¢  i was in the room the same time as he wasÃ¢  i did not see him go into the bed roomÃ¢  i was further down the stairsÃ¢  i followed up quicklyÃ¢  i did not see tedman do any thing to my lordÃ¢  on going down into the passage i saw several things lying thereÃ¢  i saw the napkinÃ¢  i didnot look into the folds of that napkin thenÃ¢  i never represented that i did at that timeÃ¢  there were two or three policemen present when i saw the napkin the second timeÃ¢  i do not know whether tedman was up or down stairsÃ¢  when i went up to the cook  after having seen the things tossed about  i asked her if she knew if any thing had been the matter last nightÃ¢  she said  no Ã¢  the expression i used to courvoisier was   courvoisier  do you know if any thing has been the matter last night   q  the same words as you used to the cook  a  she told me to call himÃ¢  those were the words i used to the cook q  pray  had you the least doubt that a great deal was the matter  a  no  i had no doubt at allÃ¢  i did not think there was any thing the matterÃ¢  not so much the matter as there was  because i had frequently seen his lordship s papers strewed about  much the same as they were that morningÃ¢  i never before found the passage strewed with things q  had you any doubt then of any thing being the matter  i did not know what to thinkÃ¢  i thought there might be something the matterÃ¢  i did not know whether the cook could give me any informationÃ¢  she was up later than me by a quarter of an hourÃ¢  i did not think she could know all this in a quarter of an hour q  why ask her  a  because i had nobody else to go toÃ¢  i did not know what to think when i saw the things in the passageÃ¢  it surprised me very muchÃ¢  i went immediately up to the cook  and told her what i had seenÃ¢  i went into the parlour first q  why not instantly go up when you saw the things in the drawingroom and in the passage  a  i did not know what the things were laid there forÃ¢  i knew nothing about itÃ¢  i did not go into the parlour before i went up to herÃ¢  i went up to the door to see the thingsÃ¢  i did not examine the street doorÃ¢  i could see it from the bottom of the stairsÃ¢  i went to it to see what the things were q  were you not surprised to find it unchained and unbolted  a  i sometimes have found it unfastened beforeÃ¢  i cannot say exactly how long beforeÃ¢  it might be before his lordship went to richmondÃ¢  once courvoisier had forgotten to fasten itÃ¢  that surprised meÃ¢  i do not know whether i mentioned that to the cook or notÃ¢  it was only once before that i had seen it unfastenedÃ¢  i was surprised at seeing the things strewed about the passage  but i was not so much alarmed till i went into the parlour  i then became more alarmedÃ¢  i just opened the shutterÃ¢  i went into the drawing room to pen the shutters  not to see if property was thereÃ¢  i did not suspect any thing when i went into the front drawing room q  although you had seen the desk twisted round  the drawers open  and the papers sticking out  you never suspected any thing wrong  a  no  i did not q  now it has been opened to us to day that courvoisier never took the least trouble to give any assistance  if i remember right  you told me that the prisoner appeared to be writing  and said he was writing to mr  william russell  a  he said he must write to mr  russellÃ¢  i said  somebody must be sent for him q  and after that  he was about to send the first man he saw at the door  a  not that i know ofÃ¢  he beckoned to the manÃ¢  he had sat about five minutes after i told him mr  russell must be sent forÃ¢  when he beckoned to the man  i gave him a push  and said   don t call such a man as that Ã¢  i did not know what he was calling him for q  what did you mean by saying   do not send such a man as that   a  because he did not look like a man to send any whereÃ¢  i did not think the prisoner was going to send him for mr  russellÃ¢  he was not a man i should send any where q  if you found a house robbed  and a murder committed  should you not send the first person you could find  a  i do not know whether i should or notÃ¢  i did not see his lordship when i first went into the room with courvoisierÃ¢  i am not certain whether i ever said i saw blood on the pillow  but could not tell whether i saw his lordshipÃ¢  i never said   i did see his lordship the first time Ã¢  i did not see himÃ¢  i never said   i was not sure whether i did or not Ã¢  i had been living at mivart s hotelÃ¢  lord william was stopping there a short time  not living thereÃ¢  he was there about a fortnightÃ¢  i left mivart s after his lordship went awayÃ¢  i do not know how soon after  it might be a fortnight  or it might be moreÃ¢  i did not go into any service after leaving mivart sÃ¢  i went into lodgings for two monthsÃ¢  i then went into lord william s serviceÃ¢  it was at mr  don s  no  9  upper john street  or lower john street  golden square  where i lodged q  you have stated you took some ale from the prisoner  did you ever say you grew quite drowsy  a  yesÃ¢  i was not asked the question to day  i felt quite drowsy afterwards  not immediatelyÃ¢  i felt sleepy and drowsyÃ¢  i feel drowsy of a night  but i felt drowsier that night  after taking the aleÃ¢  i do not say it was the aleÃ¢  i do not know whether it was the ale or what it wasÃ¢  the prisoner took some of itÃ¢  i was sitting there about threequarters of an hourÃ¢  just before i went to bed i became drowsyÃ¢  i did not become so very shortly after taking the aleÃ¢  it might be half  or three quarters of an hourÃ¢  it might be very shortlyÃ¢  i cannot say exactly the time q  do i state your sensations truly when i describe them in this way   i felt very heavy and sleepy  and felt a drowsy sensation come over me very shortly after taking the ale    a  yesÃ¢  it might be the ale that made me soÃ¢  i did not mean to convey to the jury that he gave me drugged aleÃ¢  i never tasted any thing particular in the aleÃ¢  i did not mean to insinuate that it was drugged aleÃ¢  i mentioned it merely as a matter of courseÃ¢  i never meant to insinuate it was the ale made me soÃ¢  i was dreadfully frightened after i found that his lordship was murderedÃ¢  it was after that that i said to the prisoner   what the devil are you doing there   Ã¢  i am not in the habit of speaking so  but i did not know what i was aboutÃ¢  i observed what he was aboutÃ¢  i should not have said that  had he got up and assisted meÃ¢  i think it was quite right to apprize mr  william russell immediately of the horrid event that had happenedÃ¢  belgrave square is not very far for a man to ride on horsebackÃ¢  the coachman might have goneÃ¢  courvoisier might have gone for the coachman q  and might he not have taken the opportunity of escaping  if he was conscious of any crime  a  he might have escapedÃ¢  our sleeping room is divided from courvoisier s by a wallÃ¢  i do not know whether it is lath and plasterÃ¢  it is not very thick  and not very thinÃ¢  i have knocked my hand against itÃ¢  i do not know that it is hollowÃ¢  i did not knock against it for any thing particularÃ¢  i did not notice a hollow sound that i know ofÃ¢  when i went down with courvoisier  and saw the things tossed about  i said   let us go and see where his lordship is  q  did you think any thing was the matter with my lord then  a  i did not know what to thinkÃ¢  he was unprotected  and nobody went to seeÃ¢  i found my fellow servants safe q  why did you not use the expression   let us go and tell his lordship the house is robbed    instead of saying   let us go and see where his lordship is    a  those were the words i usedÃ¢  i expected to find him in his bed roomÃ¢  i did not know whether he was in his bed room  or notÃ¢  it is a small houseÃ¢  i had been into every room except the kitchenÃ¢  i had not been into his lordship s bed room thenÃ¢  i did not know where he wasÃ¢  i did not expect any mischief was done to him at that timeÃ¢  i was anxious to see where he wasÃ¢  i had no doubt where he wasÃ¢  i believe there has been a great deal of inquiry and search made all about the premisesÃ¢  i saw a ladder on the premisesÃ¢  it has been there ever since i have been in the houseÃ¢  it was there before i went into itÃ¢  all the police saw it  and knew it was thereÃ¢  i heard inspector tedman inquiring about the ladderÃ¢  i do not know that he mentioned it at any investigationÃ¢  i heard him mention it  but not at the investigationÃ¢  i did not mention that there was a ladder on the premisesÃ¢  i heard many inquiries as to how any body could have got over the walls q  is not that ladder exactly the height of the wall which separates the yard of the premises from another  a  i never noticed itÃ¢  the ladder was not always kept in the yardÃ¢  when it was not there it was kept in the bath room  which goes off from the houseÃ¢  i cannot tell how high that wall isÃ¢  i have been in the yard hundreds of timesÃ¢  i have no idea how high the wall isÃ¢  i have gone up that ladder  but not in the yardÃ¢  i have had it in the houseÃ¢  i do not know the height of itÃ¢  it is the height of other laddersÃ¢  i do not know whether a person on that ladder could get over the sidewallÃ¢  i never saw the ladder standing there before the morning of the murderÃ¢  i did not see it till the police saw itÃ¢  it was standing in the passage on the tuesday  and i asked courvoisier to take it away  and he took it and placed it there himselfÃ¢  i remember that nowÃ¢  it stood inside when i asked him to take itÃ¢  it was in the passage just below three stairsÃ¢  i was cleaning the passage  and said to courvoisier   will you take this away    and he took it out there court q  standing in the house  a  yesÃ¢  it had been left there on mondayÃ¢  the late valet had been there hanging some pictures for his lordship  and left it thereÃ¢  i asked courvoisier to take it away  and he took it away  took it out of the house  on tuesdayÃ¢  he set it where it was found by the police  on the side of the wall of no  15  the left hand side mr  phillips q  did you desire courvoisier to put it there  a  no  i desired him to take it awayÃ¢  i saw where he took it toÃ¢  it did not surprise me in the least next morning  court q  did it reach to the top of the wall  a  not exactly  that i knowÃ¢  i never noticed itÃ¢  it stood quite upright mr  phillips q  was it leaning against the wall  a  it must be leaning against the wallÃ¢  i did not see it for a long time afterÃ¢  i saw it in the course of the day leaning against the wallÃ¢  i do not know how far it was from the top of the wallÃ¢  any body on the top of that could easily have got over the wall q  now  you were in the house ever since this unhappy event took place  have you seen any people trying chisels  pokers  and instruments of all description  against the doors and wainscoting  a  noÃ¢   looking at the model Ã¢  this is the glass door leading into the yardÃ¢  i do not know of any experiment being made on that door and door post since the policecame into the houseÃ¢  i had not observed any marks on that door before the police came into the houseÃ¢  that is the door through which i have gone scores of hundred of times into the yardÃ¢  i never noticed any marks on that doorÃ¢  i believe i first mentioned about the prisoner giving me the ale at the last examination  but i really do not knowÃ¢  i was never in the house before i went into his lordship s serviceÃ¢  i never was in the street beforeÃ¢  i had not looked out for a situation while at mr  don s q  you preferred living on your means  a  no  i did not  i was doing the servant s work in the houseÃ¢  mr  don kept two servants q  i thought you mentioned it as a lodging  a  it was a lodging when i first went there  but the servant went away  and i did the work of that servant  because i would not be spending my own moneyÃ¢  i was  it might be  about a month at don s before the servant went away  but i do not knowÃ¢  i did not hear of a situation in that monthÃ¢  i inquired of people coming to the house  and the servants in the house asked the tradespeople about a situation for meÃ¢  i did not go myselfÃ¢  mr  don is a tailorÃ¢  i had never seen the waterloo medal but once beforeÃ¢  i saw it then on the table in his lordship s bed roomÃ¢  he had emptied a little boxÃ¢  his lordship never kept his bed room door locked q  how did you find out that my lord wanted a servant  a  when i left mivart s hotel i asked the head waiter if he heard of a light place to let me know  he said he would  and when his lordship came from abroad he sent for me by one of the men out of the stableÃ¢  i never  to my recollection  heard courvoisier mention the wages he had at mr  fector sÃ¢  he had not so much at his lordship s by 5l  as the late valetÃ¢  i do not know what his wages wereÃ¢  i do not know that it was 45l  a yearÃ¢  he told me it was 5l  less than the late valet hadÃ¢  i did not hear him say he had double the wages he had at mr  fector sÃ¢  he told me had no money in the bank  and then said he had 8l q  when you said to courvoisier   let us go and see where his lordship is    did he not say to you   what will he say    a  no  i did not hear him say any thingÃ¢  i cannot swear he did notÃ¢  i never heard him say any thing at that timeÃ¢  i can swear i never heard him say thatÃ¢  i do not recollect hearing him say any thing when he was going into the diningroomÃ¢  i never heard himÃ¢  i did not see the area gate at all after the prisoner went out for the beer for the cook mr  bodkin q  you have been asked about some examination of persons in the house in the presence of mr  mayne and mr  hobler  on what day was that  a  i do not recollect the dayÃ¢  it was not the day of the murderÃ¢  i was examined in the absence of the prisonerÃ¢  the prisoner also went into the room to be examined in my absenceÃ¢  the other servants were examined separately in the same wayÃ¢  we were all kept separate from each otherÃ¢  no one had been at that time charged with  or accused of this offence  to my knowledgeÃ¢  when i went up into the bed room with tedman the door was opened by the men that went up stairsÃ¢  the door had not closed after them before i went inÃ¢  it remained openÃ¢  i do not know how near i was to the room when tedman went inÃ¢  i was part of the way down stairsÃ¢  when i went into the room tedman was round by the side of the bed against the window  near his lordship s headÃ¢  young and some other persons had been up in the room before i went up with tedmanÃ¢  i had seen the waterloo medal about three months before his lordship s deathÃ¢  his lordship was in the room when i saw itÃ¢  it was lying openÃ¢  i never in my life had any quarrel or cause of quarrel with the prisoner mary haell i was cook in the late lord william russell s service for two years and nine monthsÃ¢  his lordship dined at home on the 5th of mayÃ¢  after dinner i washed the plateÃ¢  i went out a little before nine o clock  and returned a little before tenÃ¢  i went out alone and returned aloneÃ¢  courvoisier let roe in at the front door  and he fastened the door when i came inÃ¢  he locked  bolted  and chained itÃ¢  i went down stairs into the kitchenÃ¢  i did not go out of the house after that timeÃ¢  before i went out at nine o clock  i went into the yard to fetch the cold meat in for supper  and i bolted the door after meÃ¢  the cold meat was kept in a safe in the lower yardÃ¢  the door i bolted was the one which leads from the passage close to the pantry  into the lower yardÃ¢  there were two bolts to that door  one at the top and the other at the bottomÃ¢  i do not think i bolted the bottom bolt  because it was out of repairÃ¢  i had not been in the habit of bolting that bottom bolt of lateÃ¢  on my return home i had my supper in the kitchenÃ¢  courvoisier and manser had already suppedÃ¢  manser went to bed firstÃ¢  before i went to bed courvoisier went out and fetched me some beerÃ¢  he went out by the area gateÃ¢  i did not notice where he put the key of the area gate on his returnÃ¢  it usually hung up in the kitchenÃ¢  he had taken it to let himself out of the area gate  but i did not notice on his return whether it was put there againÃ¢  i went up to bed about half past ten o clockÃ¢  the prisoner did not remain in the kitchen till i went up stain to bedÃ¢  he was in the pantry when i went to bedÃ¢  he had not been very long in the pantry before i went to bed  only a few minutesÃ¢  he had been up stairs while i was at supperÃ¢  he went up stairs to the drawing room as the bell rungÃ¢  when i got up stairs into my bed room manser was in bed q  did she to your knowledge leave  the room in the course of that night  a  no  i do not believe she didÃ¢  i did not leave it at allÃ¢  i was not disturbed at all in the night by any noise  or any thing out of the common wayÃ¢  manser got up first next morningÃ¢  i think it was about a quarter to seven when she went down stainÃ¢  i was still in bedÃ¢  she generally used to knock at the prisoner s door as she went downÃ¢  i heard her do so that morning as she went downÃ¢  she came up stairs again in about five minutes and made a communication to meÃ¢  i immediately got upÃ¢  before i got up she went again to courvoisier s door  and i heard them both go down stairsÃ¢  whilst i was dressing i heard the housemaid scream  and on hearing that i finished dressing and ran down stairsÃ¢  i ran to the lower part  near the dining roomÃ¢  i saw manser thereÃ¢  she said his lordship was killedÃ¢  i just went into the front dining roomÃ¢  i saw the prisoner and manser thereÃ¢  the prisoner had got a slip of paper and a pen  and was writing something on a bookÃ¢  i then went to the front doorÃ¢  in the course of the morning i saw the prisoner in the back diningroomÃ¢  it was a few minutes after i had seen him in the front dining roomÃ¢  he was sitting in a chair by the middle doorÃ¢  he said   oh dear  they will think it is me  and i shall never get a place again Ã¢  when i came down i saw some things lying about in the passageÃ¢  there was his lordship s cloak  an opera glass  and trinket boxÃ¢  i saw a bundle in the passage by the cloak  tied up with a dinner napkinÃ¢  the contents of that bundle were not taken out before the police cameÃ¢  i had left a thimble of mine the night before in a work box in a cupboard in the kitchenÃ¢  that cupboard is on the right hand as you face the streetÃ¢  in the morning when i went into the kitchen  i found the cupboards and drawers all openÃ¢  therewas nothing taken away that i am aware of  except that thimbleÃ¢  there was nothing of any value in the cupboardÃ¢  i do not know how it had been openedÃ¢  there was no force usedÃ¢  the lock was shotÃ¢  i think it could be opened easilyÃ¢  i could not open it when it was lockedÃ¢  this is it  looking at the plan  there are two or three doors to itÃ¢  i did not observe any marks of violence  but the lock was turned  not unlockedÃ¢  the bolt was shotÃ¢  i had locked that cupboard myself the night before  and taken the key up stairsÃ¢  there is a little bolt on one side as well as the lockÃ¢  i could not be positive that i put that bolt down  i think i didÃ¢  two of the dresser drawers were open  all out of order  and rummagedÃ¢  they had not been lockedÃ¢  i left a fire in the kitchen  the night before  when i went to bedÃ¢  i left the prisoner up  he was to supply it  in case any thing was wantedÃ¢  his lordship always had his bed warmedÃ¢  i left coals to feed it with q  do you recollect ever having any conversation with the prisoner about money  a  on the tuesday morning at breakfast he said he had only 5l   and when that was gone he must ask his lordship for moreÃ¢  there was something else said  but i cannot recollectÃ¢  i heard the prisoner say once that old billywas a rum old chap  and if he had his money he would not be long in englandÃ¢  that was all i heard him sayÃ¢  i cannot recollect when that was  exactlyÃ¢  it was about a week beforeÃ¢  it was in the kitchenÃ¢  we were at one meal  i cannot recollect whichÃ¢  the prisoner and the other servants lived comfortably together  we never had a word with himÃ¢  i was going to leave the serviceÃ¢  that was not on account of any quarrel with the prisoner cross examined bymr  clarkson q  the prisoner  and you  and the others lived comfortably and peaceably together  a  yes  we never had any quarrel  because we had no reasonÃ¢  when he said that about my lord  i only thought he said it as a jokeÃ¢  he said if he had as much money as old billyhe would not remain in englandÃ¢  he is a swissÃ¢  i do not know whether it was his lordship s custom to give him money for the weekly or monthly supplyÃ¢  he has not paid bills  except for his lordshipÃ¢  he said something about money in the bankÃ¢  that was when he said he had only 5l   and when that was gone he must ask his lordship for moreÃ¢  he said something about having 8l  in the bank q  the 5l  did not refer to all he had in the world  but to what he had for the expenses of the house  a  i did not properly understand himÃ¢  he said something about the bankÃ¢  i did not give more than 18d  or 2s  for the thimbleÃ¢  i had had it a very long time  before i went into my lord s serviceÃ¢  there was a step ladder in the yardÃ¢  it used not to be kept there lately  i thinkÃ¢  i believe it had been in the bath room  except a day or two previous to what happenedÃ¢  it is not a ladder  but steps  which open with a string from one end to the other  and stand by themselvesÃ¢  i think it is six or seven feet highÃ¢  i saw that ladder the following morning  after his lordship s deathÃ¢  it stood in the yard  just outside the glass door of the upper yard  and against the wallÃ¢  it was not quite so high as the wallÃ¢  there would be no difficulty  in a person who was at the top of that ladder  putting his foot over to the lead at the topÃ¢  i do not know whether the prisoner sat in a good many places in the course of that dayÃ¢  the back dining room was the place i saw him in q  how soon after your fellow servant gave an alarm on the opposite side of the way  was it before the coachman and groom came into the house  a  the coachman came first some timeÃ¢  i think it was five or ten minutesbefore he cameÃ¢  i do not know who gave the order for mr  william russell to be sent forÃ¢  i do not know whether it was the prisonerÃ¢  i do not know who sentÃ¢  the ostler of mr  shenton  a neighbour  wentÃ¢  that was after i saw courvoisier sitting in the back dining roomÃ¢  i saw him in the back dining room before any body was sent for mr  wm  russellÃ¢  it was a minute or two either wayÃ¢  i do not know who went for the man that went for mr  russellÃ¢  i was very much alarmed and agitatedÃ¢  i hardly knew what i did q  would you not as soon have sent the first man you met in the street  as have sent the ostler  a  no  we knew the manÃ¢  he came to the door  and knowing him  somebody asked him to go q  we understand your bed comes the right side of it  flush on the lath and plaster of the division between your bed room and the prisoner s  a  yes  it is a thin partitionÃ¢  i never examined itÃ¢  i cannot say whether i could hear him turn in his bedÃ¢  i could hear him in his room  if he moved a chair or any thingÃ¢  if he had been walking about in his shoes  and i was awake  i should have heard himÃ¢  i should hear him cough and blow his nose  if i was awakeÃ¢  i was awake when manser got up at a quarter before seven o clockÃ¢  i heard her go outÃ¢  it might be about half past six o clock when she got out of bedÃ¢  i had not spoken to her before or after she got out of bedÃ¢  there was no conversationÃ¢  i had not spoken to herÃ¢  i do not recollect her speaking before she went out of the roomÃ¢  she was about a quarter of an hour dressingÃ¢  she washes up stairsÃ¢  i cannot recollect whether she washed herself that morningÃ¢  i cannot say whether she did or notÃ¢  that was about the time she usually got upÃ¢  the prisoner used to wash and shave himself belowÃ¢  he sometimes was longer dressing than at other times q  you say he said   oh dear  they will think it is me  and i shall never get another place    did that strike you as being a natural expression for a man under such circumstances  a  i thought it seemed strange  but he was alarmed  and i thought at the time he did not know what he was sayingÃ¢  he seemed as confused and agitated as the rest of usÃ¢  there was nothing in his appearance to lead me to suppose more than that he was alarmed and agitatedÃ¢  when manser came up stairs after being below  she described to me what she had seenÃ¢  she did not tell me what she had seen in the folds of the napkin thenÃ¢  i came down and saw themÃ¢  i saw a gold pencil and tortoiseshell toothpickÃ¢  i saw them when i first went into the passageÃ¢  i saw the bundle lying  but did not untie itÃ¢  i saw the pencil case and toothpick lying in the foldsÃ¢  that was five or ten minutes before the policemen cameÃ¢  i think manser was with me at the timeÃ¢  i believe she observed them  and pointed out the thingsÃ¢  i cannot positively say whether she spoke about the pencil case and toothpick in the folds of the napkin  or whether i saw them myselfÃ¢  i cannot say whether she repeated the words  but i saw them thereÃ¢  i cannot tell whether she pointed them out to me  or i to herÃ¢  i observed the bundle lying in the passage  and the cloak  and the pencil case and toothpick case in the folds of the napkinÃ¢  i recollect seeing themÃ¢  they might be seen by a person going to the spot without meddling with them at allÃ¢  i did not see my lord s rings foundÃ¢  i had seen his lordship wear ringsÃ¢  they were much more valuable than my thimbleÃ¢  there is some plate which i believe has not been foundÃ¢  i believe there is a reward offered for someÃ¢  i know there are silver forks and spoonswhich have been advertised and never been foundÃ¢  i do not know how many piecesÃ¢  i have heard there are forks and spoons among the missing plate mr  chambers q  do you know at all how much is missing  a  noÃ¢  the pencil case and toothpick were in the folds of the napkin  outside  lying on itÃ¢  mr  shenton is a livery stable keeperÃ¢  his lordship kept his horses at livery thereÃ¢  the pencil case and toothpick were visible for any body to see that came downÃ¢  i am not aware of the prisoner s paying any of lord russell s billsÃ¢  he might have paid small bills if his lordship gave ordersÃ¢  i was to pay the household bills after ellis left  but none of the household bills were paid after ellis left  because i have got the books court q  you said the prisoner took the key in order to get out by the area  do you mean the key of the door of the house leading into the area  or the key of the area gate  a  the area gateÃ¢  the area door was bolted and barredÃ¢  i left it bolted and barred that nightÃ¢  that was after he came in with the aleÃ¢  i bolted and barred it myself after he came inÃ¢  it was not necessary to open that door to let him in with the aleÃ¢  the housemaid and i were in the kitchen while he was gone for the aleÃ¢  the door i speak of goes out of the kitchen into the area  not out of any passageÃ¢  i do not remember whether the key of the area gate was brought back to the place where it usually hung william york i was coachman to the late lord william russell  i lived out of the houseÃ¢  i should have been in his lordship s service four years on the 6th of juneÃ¢  there was also a groomÃ¢  he lived out of the houseÃ¢  on the 5th of may i went to his lordship to see him  at half past eleven o clockÃ¢  i saw himÃ¢  nothing particular passed between us thenÃ¢  i went to the house again at half past two o clock  but did not see his lordshipÃ¢  i had no directions from the prisoner about going to brooks sÃ¢  i went to the house again about ten minutes after five o clockÃ¢  courvoisier and the two female servants were at teaÃ¢  courvoisier said to me   you should have been at brooks s at five o clock  but i forgot to order you  you had better go directly Ã¢  i went directlyÃ¢  his lordship had gone when i got thereÃ¢  his lordship had some explanation with me  and i told him i had gone according to orderÃ¢  on the following morning  when i was dressing myself  a little before seven o clock  a report came to my lodging  in consequence of which i went to his lordship s houseÃ¢  i got there a few minutes after seven o clock  and saw the cook  the housemaid  and young  the butler  from no  23Ã¢  i did not see the prisoner at that timeÃ¢  young and i went up stairs to his lordship s bed roomÃ¢  young went to the bedside next to the window  and uncovered the sheetÃ¢  i perceived blood on the pillow  and on the sheet likewiseÃ¢  i did not see his lordship s face when the sheet was pulled asideÃ¢  the face was covered up with a cloth or towel of some kindÃ¢  i stood at the foot of the bed a few minutesÃ¢  the police entered the roomÃ¢  inspector tedman came into the room  and the police with him  or a few minutes laterÃ¢  that was after i had seen the sheet pulled aside  and the blood on the pillowÃ¢  tedman and the police came in while i was at the foot of the bedÃ¢  in consequence of what was said i went for a surgeon immediatelyÃ¢  i went to mr  elsgood  at the corner of park street and grosvenor street  and brought him to his lordship s houseÃ¢  on my return to his lordship s room  i saw the prisoner behind the bed room door sitting downÃ¢  his face was covered with his handsÃ¢  he said o my god  what shall i do   Ã¢  i saw him again about half an hour afterwards  down stairs emanuel young i am butler to mr  latham  of no  28  norfolk street  park lane  on the morning of the 16th of may i heard the house bell ring about seven o clockÃ¢  i went up and found manser on the opposite sideÃ¢  she told me something that had happenedÃ¢  i went to lord russell s houseÃ¢  she told me to go for the policeÃ¢  i returned in about five minutesÃ¢  york  the coachman  came very soon afterÃ¢  he and i proceeded up stairs to lord russell s bed roomÃ¢  i believe york went into the room firstÃ¢  we went in nearly togetherÃ¢  the shutters of the middle window were openÃ¢  i noticed blood on the bedÃ¢  as i was standing at the foot of the bed i saw the blood on the bolster  on the towel  and also on the sheetÃ¢  the towel was covering his lordship s faceÃ¢  i then went to the side of the bed nearest the window  and turned down the sheet of the bedÃ¢  i did not take the towel from his faceÃ¢  i had no opportunity of seeing whether there was any wound on his lordshipÃ¢  the prisoner came into the room shortly afterwardsÃ¢  at that time the head of lord russell was still covered with the towelÃ¢  his right hand was in a bending positionÃ¢  i saw that on moving the sheet q  you had ascertained  i suppose  by observation  that he was then quite dead  a  the housemaid told me his lordship was murdered  and the house was robbed  beforeÃ¢  i felt his hand when i turned down the sheetÃ¢  it was quite coldÃ¢  i did not observe any weapon or instrument on the bed or near the body of lord russell court q  when had the housemaid told you that his lordship was murdered  and the house robbed  a  at the time i crossed the road  before i came to the houseÃ¢  i saw the napkin taken off his lordship by mr  elsgood  the surgeon  afterwards mr  bodkin q  do you remember the particular phrase she used  was it the word  murdered    a  i believe it wasÃ¢  the prisoner came to the foot of the bed while i was in the roomÃ¢  he raised his hand  and instantly fell back into an arm chairÃ¢  he said   what shall we do   Ã¢  he appeared to be very much distressed at the timeÃ¢  i cannot say how long he remained in the arm chair  but it was some timeÃ¢  it might be ten minutes  or it might be a quarter of an hourÃ¢  he constantly kept saying   what shall we do   Ã¢  at the end of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour he rose up from the chair  went to a small table in the room  and began to examine a small dressing caseÃ¢  he took off the top  and also took out the inner part  and put the inner part into a cupboard  very quickly  by the side of the fire placeÃ¢  by the inner part i mean a kind of tray which lifts outÃ¢  it contained several articlesÃ¢  he came back with the dressing case after shutting the cupboard door  and with his hand he removed the rings  which i saw at the bottom of the dressing case which was under the trayÃ¢  i saw four ringsÃ¢  he removed them with his hand at the bottom of the dressing caseÃ¢  i left the prisoner at that momentÃ¢  during the time he was moving these things he spoke to me about his placeÃ¢  he said   i have lived with his lordship only five weeks  and what shall i do for my character   Ã¢  i did not make any observation to him on that  to my knowledgeÃ¢  he did not interfere with any other article in the room in my sightÃ¢  he said such and such things were missing  but i do not know whatÃ¢  he mentioned several things that were missingÃ¢  i remember his saying rings were missing  and likewise his lordship s watch and pinsÃ¢  i did not go out of the room when i left himÃ¢  i assisted mr  elsgood  who had come before thatÃ¢  he cameinto the room before the prisonerÃ¢  i assisted mr  elsgood in examining the bodyÃ¢  i noticed a rushlight in the roomÃ¢  i cannot tell the length of it when it was placed up  but it appeared to have been burning a short time  i may say an hourÃ¢  inspector tedman came in while i was thereÃ¢  after that i went down to the lower part of the houseÃ¢  the prisoner went with meÃ¢  he did not say any thing to me till we got to the bottom of the houseÃ¢  he then said   oh  here is where they came in Ã¢  he pointed to the place where i was standing at the foot of the staircase leading to the basementÃ¢  i could see the door which goes into the back area from where i was  and so could heÃ¢  that door was openÃ¢  i went and examined the door  but not with any great particularity thenÃ¢  the prisoner went to it firstÃ¢  it was not standing wide open  but it was openÃ¢  the prisoner took it in his left hand  opened it still wider  and said   here is where they came in  cross examined bymr  phillips q  you say the prisoner fell back into a chair  a  he didÃ¢  i had an opportunity of seeing my lord s neck and face when it was uncovered q  was it not a spectacle to utterly shock and horrify any body who saw it  a  it was very horrifying  so much so as to affect the nerves of the stoutest  strongest manÃ¢  it certainly affected meÃ¢  i was not unnervedÃ¢  my nerves were shaken  but i was not unnervedÃ¢  i did not see tedman at the door where the prisoner said they had got inÃ¢  i left him up stairsÃ¢  i found a silver candlestick in the bed room  near his lordship s bed sideÃ¢  i examined it  and ascertained that it was silver by the stampÃ¢  i judged by the appearance of the rushlight that it had been burning about an hourÃ¢  i have been in the habit of seeing rushlights lighted and burntÃ¢  it had not burnt out entirelyÃ¢  it appeared to have been blown outÃ¢  i judged it had been burning about an hour  from what was left mr  bodkin q  at the time the prisoner came to the foot of the bed  and fell back in the chair  was the upper part of the body uncovered  so as to expose the wound  a  it wasÃ¢  mr  elsgood had uncovered it before the prisoner had come into the roomÃ¢  the candlestick was standing by the side of the bed  on a small book case  between the two windowsÃ¢  it was as near to the head of the bed as it could possibly stand  being on the bookcaseÃ¢  there was an article of furniture immediately adjoining the head of the bedÃ¢  it was not on that  but on the book case between the two windows henry elsgood i am a surgeon  and reside at no  14  upper brook street  grosvenor square  i was called to the house of the late lord william russell on the morning of the 6th of mayÃ¢  i got there about half past seven o clockÃ¢  i went up into the bed room immediatelyÃ¢  i found him in bedÃ¢  the body was then covered upÃ¢  the clothes were over the body  as usual with a person lying in bed  and the towel was over the faceÃ¢  i turned the clothes down and removed the towel from his lordship s faceÃ¢  when i had done that i observed the body to be lying on the back  partly on the right side  slightly inclined on the right sideÃ¢  there was some blood on the sheet which was turned over  and on the pillow  and also on the towel which was over the faceÃ¢  when i turned the clothes down  and removed the towel  the shirt collar was wide open  and there was a sort of worsted network comforter  over the chest  drawn up to the chinÃ¢  i was obliged to divide that comforter before i could see the woundÃ¢  when i had done that i found the wound extended from the top of the left shoulder round to the part called the tracheaÃ¢  it went round to theright side of the trachea  dividing the throatÃ¢  that wound was decidedly sufficient to destroy life  and immediatelyÃ¢  at the commencement it was about four or five inches deep  and at the termination  i should say  about threeÃ¢  it was made with one incision  i should say  decidedly  and with very great force  by the parts that were dividedÃ¢  it was a wound that might have been made with a knife or some such instrumentÃ¢  i have not been shown any knives that were down stairs q  having observed the body  and the situation in which his lordship was lying  and the nature of the wound  in your judgment was it possible he could have inflicted it himself  a  decidedly notÃ¢  utterly impossibleÃ¢  there was no knife  nor any instrument near his lordship whateverÃ¢  i had never attended lord william russellÃ¢  i had known him by sight for some timeÃ¢  i examined the body again on the friday evening  and saw that the ball of the thumb of the right hand was nearly cut off  and there was a small incision below thatÃ¢  when i first uncovered the body the left hand gripped the sheetÃ¢  it had a firm hold of itÃ¢  there would be a great gush of blood from such a wound from the artery  to the leftÃ¢  i did not observe any appearance indicating that that had taken place q  was there any thing to show how that could have been prevented  a  there was a pillow at the left side of the bed  down by his lordship s head  which was saturated with blood  which induced me to say that had been usedÃ¢  not the pillow on which he was lyingÃ¢  it was at the corner  lying by his sideÃ¢  the corner down by his head had blood on it q  how could that have been used to prevent the gush of blood  a  it might have been held directly over the mouth of the vessel  directly the artery was dividedÃ¢  the blood which had flowed from the wound had run through the bed and on to the floor of the room cross examined bymr  phillips q  did you observe whether there was any thing on the counterpane  i do not mean any mark  did you observe the miniature of a lady  a  there was a miniature there  i believe  which tedman told me ofÃ¢  i do not recollect seeing it at allÃ¢  tedman had got there before me john nursey i am an apothecary  and live in cleveland row  st  james s  i was accustomed to be the medical attendant of the late lord william russell for many yearsÃ¢  he was about seventy three years of ageÃ¢  he had suffered from frequent diseases  and from asthma especially  and he was of a spare and feeble habit of body in consequence of that diseaseÃ¢  on the morning of the 6th of may i was called to his lordship s house in park lane  and found mr  elsgood thereÃ¢  i examined the woundÃ¢  i have heard mr  elsgood s evidenceÃ¢  i agree with him as to what he states about the wound being the cause of death  and being given by a sharp instrument with great strengthÃ¢  i could see entirely into the wound almost from one extremity to the otherÃ¢  i could not see behind  but i felt behind  and felt the boneÃ¢  after examining the wound i felt interested as to what i saw  and requested those present to place every thing in the situation in which it was first foundÃ¢  tedman  courvoisier  and other persons were presentÃ¢  i requested them to place the things as they were at the time of the discoveryÃ¢  they did soÃ¢  courvoisier assisted in doing itÃ¢  i entirely agree with mr  elsgood that it was impossible lord william could have inflicted that wound upon himselfÃ¢  i have seen some of the knives in the house  the poultry carving knife particularlyÃ¢  they were exactly such instruments as would have inflicted such a wound cross examined bymr  phillips q  i suppose a razor or any sharp instrument would have done it  a  any sharp instrument would have done it mr  adolphus q  do you mean  a razor would inflict a wound of that depth and length at one blow  a  i think it possible thomas selway i am servant to mr  cutler  who lives at no  15  the adjoining house to the late lord william russell s  on the north side  towards oxford street  i went into the house on the morning of the 6th of may  about seven o clock  hearing screamsÃ¢  i first heard screaming up stairs  as i was dressing  then i came down and heard screaming at the front doorÃ¢  i made inquiryÃ¢  it was stated what had occurred  and i went into the house q  did you hear the screaming up stairs in the house  or were you up stairs when you heard it  a  i was up stairsÃ¢  the screaming appeared to me to come from lord russell s houseÃ¢  from the atticsÃ¢  i did not hear screams from any other part of the house until i came down  stairsÃ¢  the screaming then appeared to come from the front doorÃ¢  when i went in i observed the housemaid and the cook in the passageÃ¢  i saw a cloak  an opera glass  and some other things lying in the passage  behind the front doorÃ¢  i then went into the dining roomÃ¢  i found the prisoner there aloneÃ¢  he was sitting between the door and the windowÃ¢  he was not doing any thing q  did you speak to him  or he to you  a  i cannot recollect correctly  only i remember he asked me to go down to no  100  park street  to ask the butler to come upÃ¢  i do not know who lives at no  100  parkstreetÃ¢  he did not say who the butler wasÃ¢  he appeared to be in a very agitated state indeedÃ¢  he got up from his seat to speak to meÃ¢  nothing more passed between us that i recollectÃ¢  soon after that  two of the policemen came inÃ¢  i then left the house  and returned to my master sÃ¢   looking at the model Ã¢  this wall separates the yard of lord russell s house from the yard behind my master s house  in connexion with that leadÃ¢  directly i returned to my master s house  i went to the back drawingroom window  which enabled me to look on this flatÃ¢  this is the wall behind lord russell s houseÃ¢  it continues on behind my master s houseÃ¢  the lead flat was very dusty indeedÃ¢  i should say the lead is from three to four feet wideÃ¢  it covers a flight of steps from my master s house court q  it is a lead flat which is let into the wall  and coven a flight of steps  a  yes mr  bodkin q  did you observe any marks on the dust which was lying on the lead flat  a  i did notÃ¢  i looked distinctly for that purposeÃ¢  i believe no person could have passed over it in the state in which it was then  without leaving marks or tracings behindÃ¢  these walls and the continuation of them at the back of my master s house  are whitewashedÃ¢  i looked at them at the same time to see if there was any mark or scraping of any body having gone up there  and there were no signs of any thing of the sortÃ¢  there is no mode by which any person could come from lord russell s yard across that lead flat cross examined bymr  clarkson q  you say the prisoner appeared in a very agitated state  did the two women appear in a very agitated state also  a  they did john baldwin police constable c103   i was on duty in norfolkstreet  on the morning of the 6th of mayÃ¢  i went to lord williamrussell s house a few minutes past seven o clockÃ¢  i saw a female at the door  who let me inÃ¢  rose was with meÃ¢  i was accompanied into the parlourÃ¢  i asked whether there was any man servant  seeing the things lying about the parlourÃ¢  she said   there is the man servant  sitting behind the door Ã¢  i saw a man sitting behind the door  with his hands up to his faceÃ¢  he had his face from meÃ¢  i asked why he did not get up and tender us assistanceÃ¢  he did not get up or take his hands from his faceÃ¢  he made me no answerÃ¢  i asked him after that  why in the world he did not get up and render some assistance  but he did not give any answer the second timeÃ¢  i turned round and said to rose   rose  he must know something about this Ã¢  the man made no answer to thatÃ¢  i never received any answerÃ¢  he was near enough to hear what i saidÃ¢  i remained there  collecting the things off the floor  and putting them togetherÃ¢  i then accompanied rose down into the kitchen  to see if there was any thing gone from thereÃ¢  i did not go into the front kitchenÃ¢  i went to the back kitchen door  the door leading into the back yard at the very bottom of the houseÃ¢  it was standing openÃ¢  i examined the doorÃ¢  the prisoner was not with meÃ¢  i walked out into the area  and i thought there was no break inÃ¢  i observed there had been marks of violence on the doorÃ¢  i then went into the butler s pantry  and saw a person sitting behind the door with his elbows on his knees  and his hands up to his faceÃ¢  it was apparently the same man at i had seen in the parlourÃ¢  i told him i thought he had made a devilish pretty mess of it  and said   you must know all about it Ã¢  he did not make me any answerÃ¢  i never was answered by any oneÃ¢  i theft went and examined the back yardÃ¢  there it a wall on the left hand side as you go out of the door at the back yardÃ¢  on the top of the wall  there is a lead flat in the upper yard  the yard which is on a level with the passage which comes to the street doorÃ¢  i got up out of the back yard into the top yardÃ¢  i got up by putting my foot on the window ledge  and on the door of the water closetÃ¢  rose was with meÃ¢  when i got into the top yard  i first observed the partition wall between nos  14 and 15  on the left hand of the yardÃ¢  it is a white washed wallÃ¢  near the top of it  there is a ledge of slate projecting about two inches or two inches and a half q  were there any marks on the white washed wall  showing that any person had climbed up  a  not the least whatever  nor any dust brushed offÃ¢  the ledge of slate was perfect  not brokenÃ¢  i took the steps and got up to the lead flatÃ¢  i found the steps standing in the yard by the wall of which i have spoken  leaning against the wallÃ¢  they were not in a position for a person to go up them at they stoodÃ¢  rose pulled them outÃ¢  they were not pulled out before  but standing close togetherÃ¢  on getting up the steps i had a good view of the top of the lead flatÃ¢  there was dust on itÃ¢  there were no foot marks or any appearance of a person having passed over it at allÃ¢  nor any finger marks  for i tried it with my own handsÃ¢  from the state of the dust a person could not have passed over it in the course of the night without marking itÃ¢  i could not do it myselfÃ¢  i tried it with my hand to see if it would make a mark  and it didÃ¢  i afterwards got on it and walked on it  and there were the marks of my feet upon itÃ¢  i also examined the high wall at the back of the yardÃ¢  there were no marks whatever on that of any person having got up itÃ¢  there is a low building on the right hand sideÃ¢  i observed no appearance of a person having got out of the yard or got over thereÃ¢  rose examined thatÃ¢  there were no marks whatever cross examined bymr  phillips q  what were you doing at the time you were angry with the prisoner for not giving you assistance  a  looking at the thingsÃ¢  i did not get any information of what was lostÃ¢  i asked the females what was lostÃ¢  i was angry with him for not assisting meÃ¢  the females said they did not know what was lostÃ¢  they did not tell me the things that were found in the passage q  so that they gave you but little assistance  a  they did all they couldÃ¢  they did not tell me any thingÃ¢  i could not have made any mistake when i got up on the leadsÃ¢  i did the best of my endeavours to see whether there were any marks  but i could find noneÃ¢  i would not make a mistake intentionallyÃ¢  i could not make a mistake there  because then was plenty of dustÃ¢  i am not liable to make mistakes intentionallyÃ¢  when i tried with my hands i could see that i could make marks with my finger q  a man doing a thing intentionally is a misrepresentation  not a mistake  but without intending it  have you not made a mistake in the course of this very examination at the house  a  i do not know that i didÃ¢  when i first examined the kitchen door i thought somebody had broken inÃ¢  i found afterwards that there was no break inÃ¢  i thought there was at first  when i saw the door standing openÃ¢  i did not think so after i examined the door q  did not you go down to the kitchen  examine the door  and first think somebody had broken in  a  the door was standing openÃ¢  it might have been a breaking in i thought  till i examined itÃ¢  i examined the door when i pulled it to  and could see there was no breaking in q  did you examine the door and think there was a breaking in at first  a  how could i examine the door when it was openÃ¢  i examined it as soon as i got outsideÃ¢  i did not think there was a break in after i examined the doorÃ¢  i never said i didÃ¢  it was from seeing the door open that i thought there was a break inÃ¢  i laid my hand on the lead to see if i could make marks with my fingersÃ¢  the dust was not very deepÃ¢  it had been a fine night the night beforeÃ¢  there had been no rain for some time q  tolerable good winds in the beginning of may i believe  were there not  a  certainly there were windsÃ¢  i should not say the wall is thirtyfive feet highÃ¢  i never measured itÃ¢  i do not know how high the whitewashed wall is from the groundÃ¢  i was there a very few minutes q  perhaps you did not make much observation  a  i did all i couldÃ¢  it might be fifteen or sixteen feet highÃ¢  i cannot say that it is double that heightÃ¢  it did not appear so  in my opinionÃ¢  i cannot say how many minutes i was thereÃ¢  it was more than four or five minutesÃ¢  perhaps a quarter of an hour or twenty minutesÃ¢  i call that a few minutes q  have you heard of any reward being offered in this case  a  no  neverÃ¢  i have been a policeman several yearsÃ¢  i joined it the first day q  now on the

brother policemen conversing about itÃ¢  not with any parties belonging to the house q  i am not asking about parties belonging to the house  but about your own brother policemen  do you mean to tell the jury that you have not over and over again conversed with policemen about the murder  a  i have certainly spoken to one or two  but never conversed with any body  not with the parties belonging to the houseÃ¢  i have spoken to people i know q  to policemen  a  of course i haveÃ¢  i cannot say to how many i have spoken to on the subject of the murderÃ¢  i will not swear i have not spoken to twentyÃ¢  i will not swear i have spoken to twentyÃ¢  i might have spoken to twenty  thirty  forty  or a hundred q  why  then  did you fix upon one or two  a  i fix upon nothingÃ¢  i spoke to nobody in no particular manner about itÃ¢  i asked nobody noquestionÃ¢  no policeman belonging to the house q  do you mean to persist in saying you never heard of a reward being offered  a  i doÃ¢  i never was told of any rewardÃ¢  i can write my nameÃ¢  i cannot read much  i am not a very good scholarÃ¢  i can read print in very large letters on placardsÃ¢  i belong to vine street station house

quarters of a mile from lord william russell s house q  now  184 policemen frequenting the same station house with you  do you still mean  on your oath  to tell the jury that you never heard of a reward being offered  a  i never was told of itÃ¢  i never heard of the rewardÃ¢  i do not know what the reward isÃ¢  i never heard of any rewardÃ¢  i never was offered any thing  nor ever heard of any rewardÃ¢  i did not suppose you asked whether any reward was offered to meÃ¢  i say i know nothing about any rewardÃ¢  i was never employed in searching for the missing spoons or forksÃ¢  i never read of 50l  reward being offered for them myselfÃ¢  i am a very bad scholarÃ¢  there was something read out in orders about it  in the general orders q  what was read out about it in general orders  a  there was some reward  but i do not recollect itÃ¢  i cannot tell what the reward was forÃ¢  i do not recollect the sum of money that was mentionedÃ¢  it is a thing i do not take notice of  sums of moneyÃ¢  i was present when it was read outÃ¢  i do not know what sum of money was namedÃ¢  i cannot tell how long it is since it was read out to meÃ¢  it cannot be so long as two months agoÃ¢  i cannot tell whether it was one month ago  or a week agoÃ¢  i cannot tell whether it was four days ago  or two days agoÃ¢  it might be one day ago for any thing i knowÃ¢  i cannot tell whether it was yesterdayÃ¢  i cannot tell you any thing at all about it mr  chambers q  how long after the 6th of may were you first called on to give your evidence  a  i cannot sayÃ¢  something more than a week  adjourned  friday  june19th the queen against francois benjamin courvoisier  continued  john tedman i am an inspector of the c division of police  on themorning of the 6th of may i was called to the house of the late lord william russell  about half past seven o clockÃ¢  i believe i found the coachman or groom at the door  and one or two other persons let me inÃ¢  they were servants in the neighbourhood  but i have not seen them sinceÃ¢  my attention was directed to the door of the area  leading into the passageÃ¢  there is only one door at the bottom of the house  leading into the back area  i mean the door on the floor even with the kitchen and the butler s pantry  the back doorÃ¢  it was open when i examined itÃ¢  i saw it was bruisedÃ¢  i saw several bruises when i closed the door after meÃ¢  they appeared to have been made by a blunt instrumentÃ¢  the door was bruised from the top to the bottom  all the way down in different partsÃ¢  i also examined the doorpostÃ¢  that was bruised also in a similar mannerÃ¢  the bruises on the door and door post did not exactly tallyÃ¢  the door was bruised in one part  and the post in anotherÃ¢  i could not tell exactly whether those bruises had been made by force from the inside or outsideÃ¢  the top part  i thought at the time  had been done from the outside  and the bottom part i thought had been done inside  by the bolt at the bottomÃ¢  that bolt could not be fastened without a good deal of forcing  because it was in a very rusty state  as if it had not been fastened for a considerable timeÃ¢  i exerted myself to see if i could fasten it or notÃ¢  if it had been fastened the night before  i should think it could not have been in the state i found itÃ¢  some of the marks of violence were near that boltÃ¢  those marks appeared to have been made from the inside  and i had not the slightest doubt about the upper partÃ¢  when i had done examining the door  i saw the housemaid and cook close byÃ¢  in consequence of what they said to me  i went as far as the pantryÃ¢  that is on the same floor as the door  close byÃ¢  when i went into that pantry i saw the prisoner sitting on a chair behind the pantry door  between that and the cupboardÃ¢  sarah manser said in his presence   oh dear  my lord is murdered   Ã¢  i said   come along with me  and show me where the body of his lordship is Ã¢  i said so to mantel and to the prisonerÃ¢  i told both to comeÃ¢  i then went up to his lordship s bed room with both of them  and the cook followed close afterÃ¢  i believe i went first nearly to the door  and when i asked which room it was  i really cannot say which opened the doorÃ¢  i asked for the door  and one of the three opened it  and we made one entryÃ¢  on entering the room i found the curtains of the bed partly drawnÃ¢  two of the shutters were open  of the far and middle windowsÃ¢  the shutter in front  where his lordship laid his face  was nearly closedÃ¢  that was the shutter of the third window  nearest to the head of the bedÃ¢  that was nearly closedÃ¢  i opened that window shutter  and then turned to the bedÃ¢  i saw the bed was covered over  the bed clothes lying as if the body was covered over  and a napkin over the faceÃ¢  i pulled the napkin off  turned the clothes down  and saw a great quantity of blood in the bed  from his lordship s head down to the middleÃ¢  the blood was in the bed  and on one pillow  there was some blood  but not muchÃ¢  i took the napkin off his lordship s faceÃ¢  he looked as if he was asleepÃ¢  his eyes were closed  and the tongue protruded a little way outÃ¢  just as i was doing this  the prisoner was standing at the foot of the bed  and fell back in a chair  and said   oh dear  this is a shocking job    or  a shocking thing     i am not certain which      i shall lose my place and character Ã¢  i sent for a surgeon  who came and examined the bodyÃ¢  there was a watch stand standing on a night table  close to the head ofthe bed  between that and the windowÃ¢  there was no watch in itÃ¢  i also saw a russia leather little box  and a mahogany box  which i have here  and two note casesÃ¢   producing them Ã¢  here is the watch stand  the russia box  the mahogany box  and the note casesÃ¢  the note cases were lying side by side on the night tableÃ¢  the russia case was opened  and the silk note case also as they are nowÃ¢  there was nothing in themÃ¢  upon finding these things  i asked the prisoner if there was any thing missing  pointing first to the watch standÃ¢  he said   yes    the watch was goneÃ¢  i asked him if his lordship had any money  much money about himÃ¢  he took hold of this note case  examined it  and said   yes  there was a Ã¢  10 and a Ã¢  5 note in that yesterday in the box Ã¢  that is the brown note case with the blue borderÃ¢  i asked him if there was any thing else missingÃ¢  he said he did not know  he did not think there wasÃ¢  i proceeded to make further searchÃ¢  there was a book on the floor by the side of the bed  with a pair of spectacles in itÃ¢  it was on the same side  between the bed and the windowÃ¢  it laid open with the spectacles in itÃ¢  i asked the prisoner   how did this book come here   Ã¢  he said   i left his lordship reading that when he went to bed last night Ã¢  i searched this russia  box  and found in it a gold ring  a spectacle case  and two coins  one is copper  i do not know what the other is  and this old note case  which is a third oneÃ¢  that is all i found in that box  except two or three bits of paperÃ¢  this mahogany rosewood box contained two tooth picks and two medallionsÃ¢  i then went to the table between the two windowsÃ¢  between the window in front of his lordship s bed  and the middle windowÃ¢  i found a silver candlestick upon itÃ¢  i have called it a table  but it is a book shelf  not a tableÃ¢  it had a top to it  and the books were belowÃ¢  the candle was burnt out with a little snuff in the bottomÃ¢  i have it hereÃ¢   producing it Ã¢  that was standing on the book shelf  five or six feet from the head of his lordship s bedÃ¢  a person lying on the bed could see to read by the candle  because it was right in front of the face court q  could a person who was lying in bed reach that candle  a  noÃ¢  no person could reach it from out of the bed mr  adolphus q  i believe after this  the surgeon came and examined the body  a  yesÃ¢  i found no instrument by which the wounds could have been inflictedÃ¢  there was no such thing near the place  i mean not near the bedÃ¢  there was in the roomÃ¢  it was not within reach of any body in the bedÃ¢  on the book shelf  near the candle  i found this russia case with four ivory rouleausfor sovereigns in itÃ¢  i have not examined to see how many sovereigns they would holdÃ¢  i asked the prisoner if there was any thing missing from there  pointing to the book shelf altogether  he said   really i cannot tell you  but ellis knows   ellis was the late valet  to lord russellÃ¢  he is now with lord mansfield  the little russia box was standing openÃ¢  the tray was separate from the boxÃ¢  the prisoner told me it belonged to the boxÃ¢  on the next table  between the other two windows  i found a pair of boot hooks  and a gold pinÃ¢  i looked at it  and the prisoner picked it up  and said his lordship wore that yesterdayÃ¢  i found a quantity of silver articles on the table where the looking glass stoodÃ¢  in the corner of the room near the last windowÃ¢  the looking glass was on the table  a shaving box  and these silver articles all about the table  as a gentleman s dressing articles would beÃ¢  there is a crest on them all  i believeÃ¢  there was an eye glass  two razors  and some other thingsÃ¢  there was no blood  or the slightest mark on either of those razors to denote that they had committed the actÃ¢  there were four other razorsÃ¢  i say the same of themÃ¢  there were halfa dozen walking canes in the room  four of which have gold about themÃ¢  on finding these things i said to the prisoner   it is a very curious thief to leave all this valuable property behind Ã¢  he said   it certainly is very strange Ã¢  i did not ask him any thing after thatÃ¢  i then went to the next table  upon which was a dressing case  which had been wrenched openÃ¢  i am now speaking of a little table at the foot of the bed  near the fire placeÃ¢  this is the dressing caseÃ¢   producing it Ã¢  it was standing in this way  with the back of it towards the bedÃ¢  the lid was on it  a little way out of its placeÃ¢  it had been wrenched at the hinges  and i consider that was done after it had been unlockedÃ¢  it was still lockedÃ¢  the lock remained upÃ¢  i consider that it was unlocked before it was wrenched  and the hinges afterwards wrenched  forced back  without any instrumentÃ¢  it appeared to me that the box being locked had been opened with a key  the top thrown back  and the hinges broken  and then locked again afterwardsÃ¢  a bunch of keys were found in the back drawing room  one of which fits the boxÃ¢  mr  weymouth  i believe  has them court q  you say you suppose the dressing case had first been unlocked  and then the hinges wrenched backÃ¢  can you give any reason what you form your judgment on  a  because i consider if they broke the front part they would not have wanted to break the backÃ¢  they are inside hingesÃ¢  there is no mark at the back of their having been praised mr  adolphus q  could it be opened from the back without some mark being left  a  i think it must have left some mark  but i am only giving my opinion of itÃ¢  after the prisoner and i had examined that box i said   is there any thing missing from here   Ã¢  there were five gold rings in that dressing case  and four glass bottles with silver topsÃ¢  we were counting themÃ¢  he was looking at it with meÃ¢  when i asked if there was any thing missing from there  he said   yes  five gold rings  which his lordship wore yesterday Ã¢  they were missingÃ¢  here are four mourning and one gold chased ringÃ¢  when he spoke of the five rings his lordship wore yesterday  he meant five other ringsÃ¢  he had looked into the dressing case when he gave me that answerÃ¢  i asked him if there was any thing else missing from thereÃ¢  he said   i can t tell you  but ellis can Ã¢  from there i went to a cupboard  in the left hand corner as you enter the roomÃ¢  i there found four silver mounted tobacco pipes and an opera glassÃ¢  i then examined the wardrobeÃ¢  i asked the prisoner if there was any thing missing from thereÃ¢  he said   i don t think there is Ã¢  the locks of those places were perfect and uninjured  and the hinges not touchedÃ¢  i found a rushlight stand with a rushlight in itÃ¢  about a third of it was burntÃ¢  the prisoner told me  when i looked at it  that his lordship always had a rushlight burning at nightÃ¢  i asked him what time his lordship went to bed last nightÃ¢  he said   about half past twelve  or a quarter to one o clock Ã¢  there was a key in the bed room door  insideÃ¢  i asked the prisoner if his lordship locked the door of a nightÃ¢  he said   no  he never did Ã¢  i do not believe i made any observation on the doorÃ¢  the door opens and shuts very gentlyÃ¢  i do not think a person lying in bed could hear it if they were awake  when the carpet is down  it is impossibleÃ¢  i went from there to the front drawing roomÃ¢  there was nothing there worth noticingÃ¢  i then went to the back drawing room  which is a room in which there are booksÃ¢  i found the davenport writing desk turned round a little  moved a little out of its place  and some papers lying on the groundÃ¢  the papers inside were in confusion  and appeared disturbedÃ¢  i saw a screw driver on the chair which his lordship used to sit in to writeÃ¢  i believe mr  pearse has itÃ¢  there was a bunch of keys lying by the side of the davenport writing deskÃ¢  i asked the prisoner if the screwdriver belonged to the houseÃ¢  he said   i believe it does Ã¢  i asked him   did his lordship use it yesterday Ã¢  he said   i am sure i can t tell you    i then went into the front parlour  or dining roomÃ¢  i found some drawers in the side board pulled out  and plate and plated articles lying about on the floorÃ¢  i said to the prisoner    is there any thing missing from here   Ã¢  he said   some spoons and forks  but i cannot tell you how many at present    i do not think there were any leftÃ¢  i found a cloak  an opera glass  and a great many things in the passageÃ¢  i asked the prisoner if they were his lordship s propertyÃ¢  he said   yes Ã¢  i said   no thief would ever leave this property behind Ã¢  he said   it is certainly very odd Ã¢  i asked him if he had locked the street door at night when he went to bedÃ¢  he said   yes Ã¢  he showed me howÃ¢  he put up the chain  and locked it  and put the two bolts toÃ¢  he showed me just as he had left it the night previousÃ¢  the upper and bottom bolts boltedÃ¢  i asked how he found it that morning  and after he had unchained  unlocked  and unbolted it  and put the spring of the lock back on the hook  he said   as you see it now Ã¢  the area door of the front kitchen was undamaged  nothing arises from thatÃ¢  there is a door at the end of the street door passage which goes into the yardÃ¢  half of that door is glassÃ¢  that door was not disturbed or moved in any wayÃ¢  the chain was on it  and it was boltedÃ¢  it had never been disturbed at allÃ¢  there is an inside shutter to thatÃ¢Å“  door  but it was downÃ¢  it could be taken down without undoing the fastening of the doorÃ¢  it is an inside shutter  it slips downÃ¢  it shuts up the glass partÃ¢  when i saw it  the shutter was not placed against the glassÃ¢  it was the same as it is kept in the day timeÃ¢  the glass was unbrokenÃ¢  there was not a mark on that doorÃ¢  the area gate was entireÃ¢  nothing had happened to that  it was lockedÃ¢  that is the area that leads into the streetÃ¢  there is no gate to the back areaÃ¢  i afterwards went into the pantry and saw a press there  in which were some drawersÃ¢  those drawers were openÃ¢  the top one was forced  as if it had been done by a chisel or screw driverÃ¢  the lock was sprung  as if it was left locked  and forced open in that stateÃ¢  the articles in the drawers were disturbedÃ¢  there is a window in the pantryÃ¢  i asked the prisoner whether the window had been fastened that night  whether the window shutters had been put to  and whether it was fastenedÃ¢  he said   i do not think it was  i can t say exactly  i am not certain Ã¢  i then went to the back door on the basement story  that was found bruised  as i have stated  very muchÃ¢  the prisoner assisted me to examine that door  and pointed out some marks which i had not seen before q  did you say any thing to him on the examination of that door  a  yes  i said   some of you in the house have done this deed Ã¢  he said   if they have i hope they will be found out Ã¢  i said   there is not much fear but what they will Ã¢  i looked about to see how any body could have broken into the houseÃ¢  i examined this wall  pointing out on the model the wall between nos  14 and15  but could not see any mark of any one having come down that wayÃ¢  there were some slates near the top of the steps  which i should think must have been disturbed by anybody descending that wall  but i could not say exactlyÃ¢  i saw baldwin going up the steps to examine itÃ¢  i should think no one could have gotdown that wall without disturbing the slatesÃ¢  there was a quantity of dust on the slates  and that was not disturbed at allÃ¢  i went up on the leads  but baldwin and rose were up there before meÃ¢  there was a great deal of dust on it q  could any person or thing have trampled on that dust without making marks  a  i think it impossibleÃ¢  i think a man passing there must have left marks of his feet behindÃ¢  the weather just before had been dry and windyÃ¢  if a person got over the opposite wall  that is sir howard elphinston s houseÃ¢  i should think they could not have got into lord russell s house that wayÃ¢  i examined that carefully and could see no markÃ¢  the other constables had not been thereÃ¢  there is a water closetÃ¢  they could not have got to the house without getting on that water closet  and i should think they could not have got on the water closet without disturbing itÃ¢  it was not disturbed at allÃ¢  there is a deep area on the other side of that wall  much deeper i believe than on this sideÃ¢  i examined it  i did not measure it q  did you go with the prisoner into his own bed room  a  yes  he showed it meÃ¢  he took me up stairsÃ¢  i there found a purse containing a 5l  bank of england note  and six sovereignsÃ¢  i gave them upÃ¢  i asked the prisoner how he got that noteÃ¢  he said  he gave his lordship change for it a day or two ago  and the rest of the money was his own  he had had it some timeÃ¢  he showed me his box which contained his linenÃ¢  i examined every thing in it as i went along  but saw nothing to tend to explain this case at allÃ¢  he had the key of the box himselfÃ¢  it was left in the roomÃ¢  i left it with himÃ¢  he left the box open every day q  what had he on at the time  a  in the morning a sort of round morning jacket  and a clean shirt  apparently a very clean oneÃ¢  the prisoner was from that time  though not in custody  yet under the watch of the police  and the female servants alsoÃ¢  care was taken to prevent their having any conference with one anotherÃ¢  the prisoner was not debarred or hindered from going to his own room if he pleasedÃ¢  he was taken into custody on friday  the 8th of may  in the afternoon partÃ¢  he was not taken out of the house till sunday night  but there was a constable with him constantly in the room  from friday till sundayÃ¢  he was not exactly in my custody  but there was a constable with himÃ¢  he was taken to the stationhouse on sunday night  the 10th  and before the justices  at bowstreet  on the mondayÃ¢  there were several examinations  and he was finally committedÃ¢  on the evening of the 13th  while he was in custody  application was made for some linen for himÃ¢  his uncle came to the door  and said his nephew wanted a clean shirt and stockingsÃ¢  i did not see the prisoner afterwards  so as to let him know what his uncle had said or done court q  what did his uncle ask for  a  he came to the house and said his nephew wanted some clean linenÃ¢  i had had directions to send him whatever he requiredÃ¢  i did not go up with the uncle to the place where the linen was mr  adolphus q  did you go up to the box  a  next morning i went up with sergeant lovettÃ¢  i did not send the linen that evening  as i was going to bow street myself next morningÃ¢  i went up with lovett next morning  took a shirt out  unfolded it  held it up by the collar  and these gloves dropped out of itÃ¢   producing a pair slightly stained with blood Ã¢  i first unfolded the shirt on the bed  and shook it and these gloves dropped down into the trunkÃ¢  they are such gloves as servants wear when in attendance on their masters  white cotton glovesÃ¢  i had not seen those gloves when i examined the trunk before q  had you examined with sufficient accuracy to tell whether they were there  a  i pulled the things out  and laid them on the bed  but i certainly did not examine so accurately as i did thenÃ¢  i had unfolded them  but not shaken themÃ¢  the gloves dropped down when i shook itÃ¢  i did not perceive them when i unfolded itÃ¢  i unfolded the shirt  and did not find them before  and i unfolded it then and did not find them court q  describe how you unfolded the shirt this time  a  i undid itÃ¢  i unfolded it  as if it was lying on a table or a bed  and then held it up and shook itÃ¢  i did not find the gloves when i unfolded it  but when i shook it i didÃ¢  when i first searched we unfolded the shirts on tbe bedÃ¢  i and beresford merely unfolded them mr  adolphus q  did you make any further observation at that time on the linen  a  no cross examined  bymr  phillips q  have you one of the shirts here  a  yesÃ¢  i do not think i have a clean oneÃ¢  the prisoner had all the clean ones  court q  did you examine the prisoner s hands  to see if there were any scratches on them  a  i didÃ¢  i noticed them that day  and also on that day when i took the glovesÃ¢  i first examined his hands on the first day  on the 6th  when i examined his roomÃ¢  i did not see the slightest scratch or mark mr  phillips q  did you consider it your duty to examine the trunks of the different persons in the house when you were first apprised of this melancholy transaction  a  they all wished me to do it  both the prisoner and the other servantsÃ¢  i did do itÃ¢  i examined the prisoner s trunk  to see if there was any weapon or any article with marks of blood on itÃ¢  i satisfied myself on that subjectÃ¢  i searched as carefully as i possibly could q  mind the form in which i put this question  when you talk of the morning of the 6th  is this true  that you  found two shirts  which you looked at  and found them free from spots    a  yesÃ¢  there were several shirtsÃ¢  on the 14th i unfolded the shirt which i was about to give for the prisoner s useÃ¢  i unfolded it in the same way as i did in the first instance as nearly as possible  i thinkÃ¢  on the 6th i took out every article in the trunkÃ¢  i and the prisoner both replaced themÃ¢  i assisted himÃ¢  whatever was done by him was done in my presenceÃ¢  the prisoner had access to this room  and several of our men and the women alsoÃ¢  there was no speck of blood on any thing that i saw in the trunk on the 6thÃ¢  there was no mark on the area door with the glass to it  on the 6thÃ¢  i examined it for the purpose of seeing whether there were any marks q  now  i ask you  not who may have done it  but are there not a number of marks now on that very door which had none on the 6th  a  there are  and also on the post of that doorÃ¢  they appear to have been made with some kind of instrumentÃ¢  the prisoner was under the inspection of the police from the very time of our entering the houseÃ¢  my orders were to keep them separateÃ¢  that is what i meanÃ¢  sergeant pullen was appointed over the prisonerÃ¢  he is with me at the house now  and cronin  a constable  who is hereÃ¢  i did not find any weapon in the prisoner s trunk on the 6th mr  adolphus q  you have been asked about unfolding the linen  did you  eitherÃ¢Å“  on the 6th  13th  or 14th  when you went for the shirt  do more than lay it down and unfold it  as you would linen you wanted for yourself  a  i have said i shook itÃ¢  i unfolded it and shook itÃ¢  on the 6th i only unfolded it q  in that unfolding might a pair of gloves be in the shirt and you not see them  a  i cannot sayÃ¢  there might beÃ¢  when i held it up by the collar  and shook it  every thing that was in it would come out q  was the extent of your inspection of the prisoner such as to prevent any body from visiting and speaking to him  or only to prevent the women  a  only to prevent the womenÃ¢  nobody could have any conversation with the prisoner but ourselvesÃ¢  it was to prevent any body having conversation with himÃ¢  that was the inspection under which both he and the females were placedÃ¢  i was not present when the marks were made on the glass doorÃ¢  i did not see who made themÃ¢  i know nothing  of my own knowledge  of any being madeÃ¢  i had charge of the premises  that is all court q  did you order any to be made  a  noÃ¢  i only had charge of the premises mr  adolphus q  there were none on the 6th  but there were afterwards  a  yesÃ¢  they are there now william rose police constable d124   i went to lord russell s house on the morning of the 6thÃ¢  i went into the back yard with baldwinÃ¢  we examined the wall between nos  14 and 15Ã¢   looking at the model Ã¢  this little edging represents some slates which are let into the wallÃ¢  they project about as much as this in proportionÃ¢  that edging of slate was not in the least disturbed or interfered withÃ¢  the wall itself is whitewashedÃ¢  i did not observe the least marks upon that wall  not before i made any myselfÃ¢  i saw the lead flat  which covers a stair case on the other side of the wallÃ¢  i went up for the purpose of examining itÃ¢  i went firstÃ¢  baldwin was with me as far as the leadÃ¢  there was a deal of dust on that lead flatÃ¢  there was no mark on the dust  as if any person or thing had crossed itÃ¢  i tried whether a foot or band placed on it would leave any impressionÃ¢  there was sufficient dust on the lead to write your name in itÃ¢  i also examined this small building on the opposite cornerÃ¢  it is covered with a tilingÃ¢  this black line represents a board in front of the tiling  to throw the water offÃ¢  what is called weather boardÃ¢  neither the tiling or board was at all interfered withÃ¢  that piece of weather board is quite strong enough to bear the weight of a manÃ¢  i examined the premises on the other sideÃ¢  it is a mews  i believeÃ¢  there is a bottle rack in the back yard of the next houseÃ¢  i went over the leads of lord russell s house on to the leads of no  15Ã¢  i did not go into the premises on the other side cross examined bymr  chambers q  was it a windy night that night  a  i was not on duty at all that nightÃ¢  i was in the morningÃ¢  it was very cold then henry beresford i am an inspector of police  i received information at the station house about ten minutes past six o clock in the morning of the 6th of may  and went to lord russell s houseÃ¢  after looking at the body i went down stairs to the bottom of the house  to a door which leads to the area at the backÃ¢  i examined that back area door and saw several marks upon it  and also on the door postÃ¢  my impression was atfirst  that the marks had been made with the door open entirelyÃ¢  i looked at the marks on the door postÃ¢  i could scarcely tell with what instrument they had been madeÃ¢  my impression was then that they had been made from the inside  and with the door openÃ¢  upon further inspection and examination that opinion was alteredÃ¢  i think the marks were made by inserting some instrument between the door and the door postÃ¢  the door and door post do not close exactly  and some instrument had been insertedÃ¢  i think the marks were made by a person standing outside the doorÃ¢  they might have been made when the door was bolted and fastened  but i think the door was merely on the latchÃ¢  i think the instrument could not be inserted sufficiently if the door was boltedÃ¢  that is merely my opinionÃ¢  the marks did not appear to have been made with n chisel  but i should say with a hammerÃ¢  i tried that experiment with a hammer upon the halfglass door up stairs leading into the yard  and pearse also triedÃ¢  when i first went to the house there were no marks on that door  but pearse afterwards took me to show me the experiment he had madeÃ¢  the marks on the door and door post of the back area door were not on the same levelÃ¢  the marks on the door were something lowerÃ¢   part of the door and door post were here brought into court Ã¢  when i got there the socket of the top bolt was lying on the groundÃ¢  i examined it  and could see some instrument had been put into the socketÃ¢  it was a dark instrument  at it had left a black markÃ¢  it was such a mark as might be left by a pokerÃ¢  that mark could not have been made when the bolt was shot or fastenedÃ¢  the socket was inside the doorÃ¢  i looked at the lower boltÃ¢  the socket of that bolt was not injuredÃ¢  it appeared as if it was slightly sprung  but on more particular examination i do not think it wasÃ¢  it was merely from rust and decayÃ¢  it is much decayedÃ¢  the bolt would not act in itÃ¢  i attempted to bolt it  and it was with the greatest effort i could mote the bolt at allÃ¢  this is the first rail of the door and the door postÃ¢  this is the outside of the door next the yardÃ¢  these are the marks i allude toÃ¢  one is below the otherÃ¢  if an instrument had been put in  which it must be to get a purchase  it would be quite impossible to do that without injuring this edge of the door  as the point of the instrument must necessarily fall on the edge of the door  and there is no injury whatever on the edge of the doorÃ¢  there is a mark made  but that is not the means by which the door could be prised open from withoutÃ¢  there are a great many marks in the place whore the bolt never met the socketÃ¢  the door shuts in a rabbetÃ¢  here is no mark on the edge even opposite all this violenceÃ¢   the witness pointed out to the jury the various marts on the door and door post  to which his evidence refers Ã¢  there are marks of violence on the door post by the lower boltÃ¢  i believe these marks to have been made with a screw driver or chiselÃ¢  i am speaking of the marks outside on the door post opposite the doorboltÃ¢  there are no marks on the door opposite to this to correspond with them  scarcely any violence at allÃ¢  there is one impression  but nothing to correspond with the violence on the door postÃ¢  to make the violence on the door post the instrument must catch hereÃ¢  the next mark is what i have described  as i suppose being done with a hammerÃ¢  that mark is about six inches below the handle of the latch outside  and is both on the door and on the door post  one slightly below the other  that on the door being the lowestÃ¢  i should say both those marks were done from the outsideÃ¢  i am quite certain they were made at the same time  and when the door was closed  from the experiment itried on the other doorÃ¢  they were certainly not made with sufficient violence to prise open the doorÃ¢  i am quite satisfied of thatÃ¢  not if the top bolt was boltedÃ¢  if the latch only were latched  it would be sufficient to resist the violence made  even if unboltedÃ¢  between that and the top there are five marks of exactly a similar nature  with more or less violenceÃ¢  why i feel certain the latch would resist it  is because i tried the upper door with only the latch  and i could make quite as much violence on that door with the latch only resisting  without any boltÃ¢  nearly opposite the top bolt outside there are two marks which i have describedÃ¢  i should say all the marks  except those at the bottom bolt  were made with the same instrumentÃ¢  i have no doubt of itÃ¢  there is certainly not sufficient violence to the top bolt to have forced the socket off from the outside  if it was boltedÃ¢  supposing the door to have been prised open from the outside  the bolt could not have forced the socket off in the way in which it appears to have been forced offÃ¢  there are marks inside the socket which it is impossible the bolt could have madeÃ¢  it could not have been forced from the outside without making considerable violence on the doorÃ¢  the mark is partly destroyed  because the plastered wall comes up to the door  and in taking the door away the impression was partly destroyedÃ¢  it could not be avoided  but still here is the mark of the impressionÃ¢  when i first saw it the dust had come down upon it  and it was evident that the socket had been taken off from the inside  with the door open  because i shot the bolt and found it would not make the marks here made  because it would not touch themÃ¢  it would not reach this mark within half an inchÃ¢  i felt quite certain it could not have been made by the bolt itselfÃ¢  the mark of the instrument appeared to have been recently made  because on the end of the instrument reaching the mortar  it had made an indent there  and the dust was thereÃ¢  it had been made within twenty four hours  i should sayÃ¢  i believe there are no other marks inside the door postÃ¢  here is the socketÃ¢  i found the door would not shut within a certain distance  and this piece of wood was put on to show the exact distance the door would be open in its natural stateÃ¢  it was nailed on to prevent it going further than it would beforeÃ¢  it is in the state it was beforeÃ¢  the bolt will not reach this black mark here  nor will it touch any of the marks that appear here jury q  the wood of the door post is not at all rotten  is it  a  not that i can perceiveÃ¢  the nails are all bright now  but they were rusty mr  chambers q  were you in lord william s bed room when you went to the house with the prisoner  a  yesÃ¢  i went up with the prisoner and tedman almost immediatelyÃ¢  i wished to see the bodyÃ¢  i almost immediately asked the prisoner all the articles that were missing  that i might circulate them through the police generallyÃ¢  i asked him to describe them as nearly as he couldÃ¢  among other things he described a gold watch  but not at that timeÃ¢  he kept saying   you had better send for ellis  ellis knows better than i do Ã¢  he mentioned several articles only slightly  and said ellis would know much better than himÃ¢  i went down and examined the door  and afterwards went up and had all the articles described as well as he could tell meÃ¢  i went down and examined the door  and afterwards returned up stairs with him againÃ¢  it was then he gave me a description of the articles  after my return to the bed roomÃ¢  he mentioned a gold watch  and showed me where it always stood  in a case alongside his lordship s bedÃ¢  he said it was a gold watch with three sealsattached by a black ribbonÃ¢  he told me the watch was made by a foreign or french maker  but he could not tell me the name  but it had  lord william russell  engraved on the caseÃ¢  that is all the description he gave me about the watchÃ¢  he said one of the seals had lord william russell s coat of arms on itÃ¢  he said he knew it was something about a goat  but all at once he said he would go and get me the impression of his sealÃ¢  he went and got a wax impressionÃ¢  in the course of the day i went up into the prisoner s bed room with tedman and the prisonerÃ¢  i believe mr  mayne was there tooÃ¢  that was the first time his box was searchedÃ¢  it was about the middle of the day on wednesdayÃ¢  in a black trunk or box between two waistcoats  about the centre of the box  i found a chiselÃ¢  this is itÃ¢   produced Ã¢  when i first went into lord william russell s bed room  i had seen a rushlight shade  with a rushlight partly burnedÃ¢  i afterwards received a rushlight from one of the servants  i believe sarah manserÃ¢  i lighted it and tried the experiment how long it would take to burn down as far as the one i found in the roomÃ¢  it took about half an hour as near as possible cross examined bymr  philips q  did you find the door of the prisoner s chamber open  a  when i went up to search his box  i really will not undertake to say whether it was or notÃ¢  it was not locked  certainly  at all events  i should sayÃ¢  i really do not recollect whether it was openÃ¢  i do not know that there is no lock to the doorÃ¢  i never took that noticeÃ¢  i really do not recollect whether there is a lock to the door or notÃ¢  i was not in the house when you and mr  clarkson went up to that roomÃ¢  i do mean to say that i do not recollect whether there is a lock  i believe there is  but there may not beÃ¢  if i have any belief  it is in favour that there is a lock  but there may not beÃ¢  the trunk was not openÃ¢  while we were searching the bed i ordered the prisoner himself to get the trunk open for my searchÃ¢  i suppose he opened it  but we were taking the clothes off the bed very carefully one by one  and i really cannot tell i did not notice whether the trunk was locked or notÃ¢  the same search was made of the two female servants as of himÃ¢  i cannot tell whether the trunk was locked or notÃ¢  i should say i took about half of the things out before i came to the chiselÃ¢  i certainly took the things that were at the top of the trunk  off q  did you go to examine it  or had you any specific object  a  on finding the marks on the door  my impression was that they were not made by a house breaker  and that no house breaker had got in  and my wish was to examine all the trunks to find if there was any thing suspiciousÃ¢  i went to the trunk for the purpose of examining its contentsÃ¢  i took them outÃ¢  i did not undo every articleÃ¢  i do not think i took all the articles quite out  for when i got just to the bottom i believe i turned them from one end of the box to the otherÃ¢  i examined sufficiently to convince myself that there was nothing suspicious to be found mr  chambers q  was there more than one trunk or box examined there  a  there wasÃ¢  i examined a black trunk  or i should better have described it as a portmanteauÃ¢  the prisoner saw me take the chisel outÃ¢  he did not make any observation q  did you open any of the articles  a  i think i recollect two shirtsÃ¢  i opened them merely to look at the wristbandsÃ¢  i did not shake them nor turn them out nicholas pearse i am an inspector of the a division of police  i first went to the house of lord william russell on wednesday  the 6thof mayÃ¢  after being up stairs i went to the lower part of the premisesÃ¢  i examined carefully the marks on the door and door post of the door leading out into the back areaÃ¢  it was not my opinion that it was done for the purpose of breaking inÃ¢  i arrived at that conclusion after my examinationÃ¢  the socket which receives the bottom bolt was onÃ¢  the upper one was forced offÃ¢  that appeared to me to have been done by some instrument put into the socket when the door was open  and the instrument wrenched both ways to prise it offÃ¢  i think that was the case  by the marks on the wood of the door postÃ¢  it was on thursday i more particularly examined it q  explain what marks satisfied you that it was forced off by an instrument put into it  a  the top nail was in the socket  and the other nail was at the bottom of the door outside  and the nail bentÃ¢  when the door is bolted  the bolt does not come to the wood by half an inchÃ¢  then is a mark on the wood  and the wood is driven back by some instrument  and it appears very recently doneÃ¢  i found marks at such a distance that the bolt  when shot into the socket  could not reach themÃ¢  i have no doubt those marks were made at the time the socket was forced offÃ¢  i found this poker  produced  in the fire place in the pantryÃ¢  it is bentÃ¢  it was in the same state when i found it as it now appearsÃ¢  such an instrument would make similar marks to those of which i have been speaking  on the woodÃ¢  i found a screw driver on a shelf in the same pantryÃ¢  i applied that to some marks on the door  and it corresponded with themÃ¢  i found this hammer  produced  in a cupboard in the pantryÃ¢  i fitted this to some marks on the door and door post  and it corresponded with them  by placing the claws of the hammer between the door and door post when shut  on the outsideÃ¢  supposing the door to have been bolted inside  the pressure caused by the claws of the hammer would not have been sufficient to force it openÃ¢  it would not be possible with such an instrument to force that door inwardly  supposing it to be bolted insideÃ¢  the marks by the upper bolt and socket could not possibly have been made by a person on the outside  supposing the door to have been fastenedÃ¢  i found the bottom socket started from its place  but not offÃ¢  the bolt was rusted in the socketÃ¢  i should say it had certainly not been used latelyÃ¢  there were marks of violence by that lower boltÃ¢  that violence would not be necessary  supposing the bolt had not been shotÃ¢  i found some marks near the bolt  which  in my judgment  could not have been made if the lower bolt had been shotÃ¢   pointing them out Ã¢  here is a mark on the rabbet  as if an instrument had been put in from the outside between the door and door postÃ¢  if the bolt had been shot  that could not have been doneÃ¢  there is a mark on the outside which corresponds with the mark i have alluded toÃ¢  that mark apparently done by an instrument such as this screw driverÃ¢  a person outside could not have made the mark inside in the rabbetÃ¢  he could have made the mark on the outside q  from all your observation and examination of the door and post  in your judgment did any person break that from the outside or not  to enter the house  a  not to enterÃ¢  some of the marks were made outside when the door was to  and some of them when the door was openÃ¢  a breaking into the house could not have taken place by means of that door  not by the marks madeÃ¢  i made some experiments on the half glass door  on the ground floorÃ¢  some were made only last saturday  and some beforeÃ¢  till those experiments were made  that door was uninjured  and unmarked inall respectsÃ¢  i made the first mark on it myself with the hammerÃ¢  i made those experiments to see if such an instrument made such a mark as we discovered on this door  and it appeared to do soÃ¢  there is a latch on the half glass doorÃ¢  an experiment was made on that door while it was on the latchÃ¢  it was made with a hammer  by placing the claw of the hammer between the door and post  and pressing the handle downÃ¢  the latch resisted the pressureÃ¢  it made a similar mark to those on the door below  equally deepÃ¢  i found this pair of tongs  which i applied to this part of the door of the safe in the pantry  which had been forced openÃ¢   producing it Ã¢  the mark on this appears to have been made with the tongsÃ¢  it is a black round markÃ¢  i also found a chisel in that roomÃ¢  i compared the screwdriver with some marks on the safe  and there were two marks which appeared to have been made with that jury q  was the bolt shot when you tried this to the door  a  yesÃ¢  it was placed back with very little difficulty court q  that is the bolt of the lock of the pantry safe  a  yes mr  bodkin q  on the thursday did you make any inquiry of the prisoner about any missing property  a  yesÃ¢  i asked him if he knew what money or property had been takenÃ¢  he said he had seen a 10l  and a 5l  note in a purse a few days agoÃ¢  i asked him where the plate was kept that was found in the passageÃ¢  he pointed out a cupboard in the sideboard in the dining roomÃ¢  1 do not think he mentioned any other things as having been missedÃ¢  i searched the prisoner s box on fridayÃ¢  shaw  a constable  was present  nobody elseÃ¢  i was not there at any time with tedman when any search was made in his roomÃ¢  there was a portmanteau  a deal box  and five drawers in the roomÃ¢  i turned the things outÃ¢  i did not find any thing that attracted my attentionÃ¢  i saw the shirtsÃ¢  i cannot say that i opened themÃ¢  to the best of my recollection i saw two clean shirtsÃ¢  they were in the portmanteau  to the best of my beliefÃ¢  on the same day  friday  i made a search in the prisoner s pantryÃ¢  at that time work people had been brought into the house to open the drains  and make search of that kindÃ¢  they had taken up the drainsÃ¢  i commenced my search by the side of the fire place  between the fire place and the sinkÃ¢  the sink is near the fire place  under the windowÃ¢   referring to the plan Ã¢  this is the sink in a recess under the window  just at the corner of the fire placeÃ¢  i took off a piece of skirting board which runs from the fire place to the corner  meeting this piece which forms the angle on to the sinkÃ¢   producing the two pieces of skirting Ã¢  i took this piece down firstÃ¢  this is the piece that faced meÃ¢  when i pulled that down i saw the purse which i now produceÃ¢  it was about two inches in behind this piece of skirting which remainedÃ¢  i perceived that the mortar had been disturbed before i took this piece of skirting awayÃ¢  i found in the purse five gold coinsÃ¢  one was in paperÃ¢  five gold rings  one a wedding ring  and a small bit of sealing waxÃ¢   the coins were here produced Ã¢  i then took away this piece of skirting board which ran under the sink  and found this silver waterloo medal  and a little further on this Ã¢  10 bank of england note folded upÃ¢  it had nothing round itÃ¢  the place from which i took it was quite dryÃ¢  it was very near the fire placeÃ¢  the prisoner was in the dining room at the time i found these thingsÃ¢  i went up there directly after finding themÃ¢  he was  to the best of my knowledge  sitting down when i went into the room  but i saw him standing upÃ¢  i think constable collier was with himÃ¢  there was a constable in the roomÃ¢  itook the things i had found up with me  took them out of the purse  and laid them openly before him  and laid the note on the table before himÃ¢  i said   i have found these things concealed in your pantry  behind the skirting board Ã¢  he said   i know nothing about them  i am innocent  my conscience is clear  i never saw the medal before Ã¢  i took him down into the pantry  and pointed out to him the places from whence i had taken the thingsÃ¢  he again said   i am innocentÃ¢  i know nothing about them Ã¢  he remained in the pantry for some time  and i proceeded in my search while he was thereÃ¢  a water pipe goes round his pantry  and continues into a scullery adjoining it  into which there is a door from the pantryÃ¢  one of the workmen was removing the pipe which goes round into the pantry  between the pantry and the door leading into the vaultÃ¢  collier was on my side  and i heard some one say   there is a ring Ã¢  i saw the workman put up his hand behind the pipe  nearly to the bottom part of it  and take the ring from the pipe  and i took it from himÃ¢  it was one of the men employed thereÃ¢  this is the ringÃ¢   producing it Ã¢  it is a split ringÃ¢  i continued the searchÃ¢  a pen mender was found in a drawer in the pantryÃ¢  the things i have mentioned were all i found secreted below on the first searchÃ¢  after searching below i went up to the prisoner s bed room  and there searched his personÃ¢  i found about 5s  in silver  a small locket  and a small bunch of keys on himÃ¢  i did not apply any of those keys to any of the drawers or doors in the houseÃ¢  there was a variety of keys of different sortsÃ¢  the name of lord william russell is on one of the rings of the keysÃ¢  he said the locket was his ownÃ¢  i have no reason to believe to the contraryÃ¢  i then again went below into the pantry  but found nothing moreÃ¢  other officers were pursuing the search  assisted by workmenÃ¢  i saw the hearth stone taken up the same afternoon or evening  after the split ring had been discoveredÃ¢  i think the prisoner was not there at the timeÃ¢  i did not myself see any thing found thereÃ¢  the hearthstone was very firmly fixed in the groundÃ¢  i should say it had not been recently removedÃ¢  i did not perceive any chink or opening between theÃ¢Å“  flooring boards and the hearth stoneÃ¢  i received this tea spoon and saltspoon from sarah manserÃ¢   producing them  cross examined bymr  clarkson q  i think i understood you to say that you made some experiment with the door leading into the backyard  a  yesÃ¢  that is the door which is partly glazedÃ¢  i also made the experiment on the door postÃ¢  it was done at the same timeÃ¢  i am the person that did itÃ¢  i did both at the same timeÃ¢  i did some on saturday last  and there were marks some time beforeÃ¢  i cannot tell the dateÃ¢  it might have been a week q  are there any marks either on the door or posts of the door that were not made by yourself  a  yesÃ¢  i think there is oneÃ¢  that was made in my presence by a man named craker  a carpenter q  now  for the purpose of pointing out to the jury the result of your judgment of the violence you found on the door before you  you have cut away part of the door  and brought here  a  i had formed my opinionÃ¢  it was not from the result of my experiment alone that i came to my conclusion with reference to this door q  did that assist your judgment  a  it confirmed itÃ¢  the comparison of the marks i made on the other door and post confirmed my judgment that a similar instrument would make such a markÃ¢  i did notthink it requisite to bring the other door and post hereÃ¢  i thought what was brought quite sufficient for the jury to form their judgmentÃ¢  i made the experiment to show craker that a hammer would make such a markÃ¢  that was partly the reason why i made the experimentÃ¢  i certainly applied the instrument in the presence of craker  just to see that a hammer would make such a markÃ¢  it was not with the hammer that is produced to day that i made the experiment  but a similar oneÃ¢  not the hammer to which i attribute these marks  but a similar one q  why not use the same  a  being fearful it might get out of its place  so that i could not produce it in the state in which i found it  i was fearful i should alter the state of itÃ¢  i have not the hammer here with which i made the experimentÃ¢  the glass door is not here  and i have not brought the hammerÃ¢  it did not occur to me that i should be asked whether the hammer was the same or notÃ¢  if it had  i should have brought it q  were there any experiments besides the one which you have spoken of  made by any body but yourself  a  i do not knowÃ¢  inspector beresford was thereÃ¢  i did not see anyÃ¢  i saw craker apply a pair of tongs to the glazed doorÃ¢  i have seen it put to  to compare the marks with the tongsÃ¢  i never saw the tongs in the commissioner s handsÃ¢  i saw a man named christie  who  i believe  is a builder or carpenterÃ¢  i do not know that i ever put it into the hands of any person  but several might have seen me do itÃ¢  no one did it that i recollect but myselfÃ¢  i do not know that any one made the experiment with the tongs besides those i have namedÃ¢  beresford might have done itÃ¢  i do not recollect seeing the tongs in his handsÃ¢  collier did not have the tongs in his hands in my presence  not to my knowledgeÃ¢  no  collier had not the tongsÃ¢  i think i can safely say soÃ¢  he did not have the tongs in his hands making the experiment in my presenceÃ¢  he stood by and saw me compare themÃ¢  i have no recollection at all of ever having seen the tongs in his handsÃ¢  there was no other instrument used to try any experiment on that door but the tongs and the hammerÃ¢  i remember some gaping experiments on the door post at the edge  two or three pieces out at the cornerÃ¢  i believe they were made with the hammerÃ¢  i must have made them  because i was the only person that applied the hammerÃ¢  if i saw the door i could tellÃ¢  i made as many as eight or ten  and i have no doubt i made the marks you allude to  because i applied the hammerÃ¢  i have every reason to believe i made those marksÃ¢  i know i made marks  but whether those are the marks you have seen i do not knowÃ¢  there is a mark on the door  and one on the postÃ¢  i will not swear i made all the marks on the door and door postÃ¢  i will swear i made half of them  and more than thatÃ¢  there is one mark of the tongs which craker madeÃ¢  there are about twenty marks i should say on the door and door postÃ¢  no marks were made with this screw driver in my presence or to my knowledgeÃ¢  i never saw any marks on the glass door that had the appearance of having been made with this screw driverÃ¢  i think i last noticed that glass door on mondayÃ¢  i did not receive any orders from my superiors to make the experimentsÃ¢  i did not ask permission of any body to make those experiments before i made themÃ¢  they were all made after the last examination before the justiceÃ¢  they were not made at the suggestion of any body  but at my ownÃ¢  i have not brought that door and post with me q  did you bring the door and post which are here to day by order of your superiors  a  not by the commissioners  i proposed itÃ¢  i had them taken awayÃ¢  the parts of the door cut downÃ¢  that was done by my ordersÃ¢  i had no instructions from any body to do soÃ¢  i think mr  hobler told me to bring them hereÃ¢  i had told mr  hobler that i had applied the hammer to the glass doorÃ¢  i received no directions to bring that door here q  are there marks of violence on any of the wood work you have produced which you assume to have been made by a chisel like this  a  there is a mark on a drawer which i saw the first day which such an instrument would makeÃ¢  i cannot positively say whether there are any marks on any of the wood produced which have been made by such an instrument as thisÃ¢  there are none here which i can speak toÃ¢  i think if violence to any extent had been used on mahogany or any other hard wood with an instrument like this  it would show that violence had been used to it q  then this chisel  in your judgment  is not in such a state as you would expect if it had been used for any violence  it depends entirely on what force is usedÃ¢  i searched the prisoner s boxes on friday  the 8thÃ¢  constable shaw was with meÃ¢  he went up with meÃ¢  i believe i asked him to go up for the purpose of making the searchÃ¢  i consider that i made the search with every degree of minutenessÃ¢  there was a black leather portmanteau and a box besidesÃ¢  those were the two articles in which the prisoner s things wereÃ¢  the trunk was not lockedÃ¢  it was shut downÃ¢  i do not think it was strappedÃ¢  there is a strap to itÃ¢  one of the buckles might have been fastenedÃ¢  i do not recollect whether it was strapped or not  but i think not q  what induced you to go up on the 8th to examine the portmanteau and box  they having been examined by tedman on the 6th  a  i went to examine the dirty linen  and the coat  waistcoat  and trowsers  pockets  and to examine the clothes  for no other reasonÃ¢  when i make a search  and see any thing that may strike my attention  i may say a general search  i might go again  and be more minute than i was the first timeÃ¢  i generally make a search with every degree of minutenessÃ¢  i went to make a minute searchÃ¢  i knew that tedman had already made a search on the 6thÃ¢  it was impossible for me to tell whether he made a minute searchÃ¢  i was not thereÃ¢  i had never heard he had made a minute searchÃ¢  nobody suggested to me to make a second search  i swear thatÃ¢  it came into my own headÃ¢  it was on the 8th  the day i found the propertyÃ¢  it was after i had found the property  i mean the concealed propertyÃ¢  i saw some clean linen thereÃ¢  i looked at it  and examined itÃ¢  i might have opened some  but i do not recollect that i opened every article i foundÃ¢  i do not think i did  i do not believe i didÃ¢  i will not swear it  but it is my opinion that i did notÃ¢  to the best of my belief  there might have been articles that i did not openÃ¢  there was such a variety i could not examine every article that came into my hand q  did you not turn out from the box and portmanteau every individual article that was in them  a  i took them out with my handÃ¢  to the best of my belief i did not unfold the shirtsÃ¢  i do not think i have any recollection of opening the clean shirtsÃ¢  i think there were two clean shirtsÃ¢  i think there was only twoÃ¢  i am not certain that i unfolded themÃ¢  i have no certain knowledge that i did do it  and to the best of my belief i did not unfold themÃ¢  i took them outÃ¢  i took out every thing  and put them on the bed  and left them on the bedÃ¢  i did not put them back againÃ¢  i saw the prisoner put them backÃ¢  i had left the room  came there again  and saw the prisoner placing his things awayÃ¢  i put the shirts on the bed with other things q  now  will you have the kindness to repeat what you say passed between you and the prisoner when you say his answer to you was   i am innocent  i know nothing about themÃ¢  my conscience is clear    a  they are about the exact words q  i want to know what was the act done  or the words said by you  which preceded that observation of his  a  i said   i found this property concealed in your pantry  q  what was the object of your making that observation to him  a  i thought it my duty to acquaint him  because i suspected that he had put them thereÃ¢  i thought as an officer i was in duty bound to do it q  it was not to get a confession from him  a  i never tried itÃ¢  it was not for that purposeÃ¢  it was for no other reason than i thought it my duty  in that stage  to make the prisoner acquainted with what was found  and whereÃ¢  i naturally expected he would make some replyÃ¢  it was impossible for me to tell what reply i expected q  do you really mean to tell the jury  and to pledge your sacred oath to that answer  that in making that display of the things  and telling him that  that you had no object to obtain from him a confession  a  i expected he would make a replyÃ¢  i suspected what he might say might be evidenceÃ¢  it might be for him and it might be against himÃ¢  what i expected it is impossible for me to knowÃ¢  am i bound to answer the question  what i expected court q  you can state what passed in your own mind  a  i naturally expected he would make some remark  and i considered it my duty to make him acquainted with it mr  clarkson q  on your oath  did you hope or expect  when you produced the things  and made that statement  that you would obtain from him a confession  or any thing to that effect  a  i was anxious  decidedly  to do all i could in the case  but as to being anxious that he should make a confession to me  i was not particularly anxious  i felt an anxiety to arrive further into the state of the businessÃ¢  i am sot aware that the question was an improper one q  did you do that entirely of your own suggestion  a  i suggested it firstÃ¢  mr  mayne  the commissioner  was in the roomÃ¢  he it a magistrate  i believeÃ¢  i first suggested the producing of the thingsÃ¢  i thought it my duty at once to make the prisoner acquainted with what had been found in the pantryÃ¢  mr  mayne coincided with meÃ¢  mr  mayne said   take the property up stairs  and let him see it    to the best of my recollectionÃ¢  mr  hobler was present  as well as me and mr  mayne q  now attend to thisÃ¢  did you not state this to the prisonerÃ¢  be careful how you answerÃ¢   i have found these things concealed in your pantry  con you know look me in the face   Ã¢  did you make that observation  a  yes  i made that observation with othersÃ¢  those were the words q  on your solemn oath  why did you suppress those words when my friend  mr  bodkin  asked you the question  having  as you say  no hope or expectation of obtaining a confession from the prisoner  a  why i should not mention to the counsel that i found them concealed q  noÃ¢  you say you went to the prisoner  and in the discharge of your duty presented the things to him  and said   i have found this property concealed in your pantry Ã¢  why suppress the remaining part of the sentence   can you now look me in the face    a  i had no motive or reason for suppressing it q  will you now swear you did not expect to obtain a confession from him  when you said   can you now look me in the face    a  it was impossible for me to say what he would sayÃ¢  i did not expect a confessionÃ¢  i have told you over and over my motiveÃ¢  i considered it my duty to do itÃ¢  i thought it was no other than a proper question to put to himÃ¢  i used no intimidationÃ¢  i cannot say whether that might intimidate him or notÃ¢  it was very likely to do so if he was a guilty manÃ¢  i do not think the question i put was an intimidationÃ¢  it might be taken in that light by the court  but i did not think soÃ¢  if i had thought so i should not have put the questionÃ¢  there is a reward in this caseÃ¢  i believe it it 400l Ã¢  there is also 50l  offered for the recovery of some plate stolen from his lordship s houseÃ¢  i do not belong to the same station as baldwin q  do you expect to get any of the reward  if the prisoner is convicted  a  very likely i mayÃ¢  i do expect it  in the course of my dutyÃ¢  if i should say no  i should say falseÃ¢  i have had nothing at all yet  not a farthing from any body q  how long after the reward was offered did you make the discovery in the skirting board  a  the property was found before i was aware there was a reward offeredÃ¢  i found the property on the friday  and on that evening late  i think twelve o clock  i called at the station house  and found there was a reward offeredÃ¢  that was after all the property was found by meÃ¢  i have not the least notion what share i shall get if there is a convictionÃ¢  i am not aware that i shall get any if there is not a convictionÃ¢  the reward is upon convictionÃ¢  if the prisoner is not convicted there will be no rewardÃ¢  i never thought of a reward at the time i said to the prisoner   can you now look me in the face   Ã¢  if there had been any bloodstained articles in the prisoner s box  when i examined it on the 8th  i think i should have seen themÃ¢  i believe i should have seen them  if they had been in the box or the portmanteauÃ¢  i searched the prisoner s person  and found a locket on himÃ¢  that locket was never claimed as being his lordship s  not by meÃ¢  i have no reason to believe it is my lord s locketÃ¢  i have reason to believe it belongs to the prisonerÃ¢  i took it from him  because i thought it my duty to take what property he had from him  particularly such an article as thatÃ¢  i did not know at that time that his lordship had lost a locketÃ¢  i did not see ellis on the subject of this locketÃ¢  i never heard ellis say he thought it was my lord sÃ¢  he said it was notÃ¢  i think i did hear ellis say he thought it was my lord s  whilst in the room  but not at the time i took it from the prisonerÃ¢  i think i saw ellis before i found the locket on the prisonerÃ¢  i saw him in his lordship s houseÃ¢  i was not aware  till after the locket was found in the prisoner s possession  that there was one missingÃ¢  that locket was not produced to lady sarah bailey  to my knowledgeÃ¢  i was not present at the time she saw it john christie i am a carpenter and builder  and life in the new cat  lambeth  on saturday last  the 13th of june  i went to no  14  norfolk street  and examined this part of the door and door postÃ¢  it was shown me by inspector pearseÃ¢  i examined it carefullyÃ¢  i saw some marks on the outside of the door  and also on the door post outsideÃ¢  the marks of violence on the outside  were not  in my judgment  sufficient to have forced the door open if it had been boltedÃ¢  if forced open from the outside  the marks of violence must certainly have been greaterÃ¢  i examined the socket of the upper boltÃ¢  i should say that had been forced off by a pokerÃ¢  by applying my magnifying glass to it  i could tee that by the grain of the woodÃ¢  that socket could not have been forced off by the poker  if the poker had been used from the outside  while the door was closedÃ¢  in my judgment  the poker must have been used after the door was openedÃ¢   looking at the poker produced Ã¢  i should say it could have been done by this pokerÃ¢  if it was bolted  they could not get the poker inÃ¢  i am quite sure it could not have been done by the bolt q  supposing the bolt to have been shot into the socket  and the door forced open  could the socket have been forced off by the bolt  in the manner it it  a  no  i do not think it could  because the poker could not be usedÃ¢  the staple was on too fast for the violence used to force it offÃ¢  the marks on the door do not appear sufficientÃ¢  i see no mark inside the door post where the bolt shuts againstÃ¢  there is plenty of roomÃ¢  the bolt does not go at far into the socket as the mark of the poker extendsÃ¢  i also observe tome marks at the bottom of the door where the bottom bolt isÃ¢  i looked at the bottom bolt and socketÃ¢  i should not suppose from the appearance of the bolt that it had been bolted at all  very little  if anyÃ¢  the marks of violence at the bottom of the door near the bolt  were not considerableÃ¢  part had been made by a screw driver  and part by a pokerÃ¢  they had been used from the outside  when the door was closed  only on the latchÃ¢  it could have only been on the latch  because i should say they could not get at it well withoutÃ¢  i should have thought the instrument would have cut the door  if it had been dose extent when on the latchÃ¢   the witness here pointed out to the jury the several marks on the door  and door post Ã¢  here is the mark of a screw driverÃ¢  if it bad been used to force it open  it would have marked the edge of the door with itÃ¢  here it where the poker hat been applied to itÃ¢  besides the marks at the top and bottom  where the bolts are  there are three or  four little hammer marks outside the door and postÃ¢  they do not appear to have been done with sufficient violence to force the staple offÃ¢  from the whole appearance of this doot  it is my opinion it was not opened with force from withoutÃ¢  it must have been opened first before that violence was usedÃ¢  all these impressions were done while it was on the latch  and not boiledÃ¢  i have teen this part of the cupboard door before  and hare compared the tongsÃ¢  there is an impression of these tongs cross examined bymr  clarkson q  if those tongs were applied to it two or three times to make examinations  that would be very apt to make a mark  would it not  a  that must have been done on purpose mr  chambers q  you speak of hammer marks  and screw driver marks on the large door  did you compare a hammer and screw driver with those marks  a  i didÃ¢  here is the hammer and screw driverÃ¢   looking at them Ã¢  they exactly correspond with the marks i find on the door george collier police constable e88   i went to lord russell s house on the 6th of mayÃ¢  i examined the door and door post leading into the back areaÃ¢  in my opinion from the appearances i observed  the breaking was from withinÃ¢  on the 8th of may  i assisted inspector pearse in a search made in the prisoner s pantryÃ¢  i saw mr  pearse remove a small piece of skirting board leading from the fire place to the corner where the sink is  and take a purse from there  and afterwardt a silver medal  with a ribbon attached to it  and a Ã¢  10 bank of england noteÃ¢  mr  pearse thenleft the pantry  and went up stairs to the prisoner with the thingsÃ¢  i followed him up to the parlourÃ¢  the prisoner afterwards came down into the pantryÃ¢  i went on with my search about the placeÃ¢  i saw mr  pearse find a split ringÃ¢  it fell from behind a leaden pipe  which is against the wallÃ¢  the prisoner continued in the pantry some time while we were searching  three or four hours  i should thinkÃ¢  i saw some rings in the possession of pearse  which he took from behind the skirtingÃ¢  i did not hear the prisoner asked any questions about themÃ¢  i heard him say he never saw the medalÃ¢  he said nothing to pearse about the rings  but he did to meÃ¢  he was in company with me in the pantry  and i asked him if those were his lordship s rings which pearse had foundÃ¢  he said they  were  and his lordship had worn them yesterdayÃ¢  i asked him where his lordship had put them when he went to bedÃ¢  he said   on the table  in his bed room Ã¢  i asked him if his lordship had a gold split ringÃ¢  he said he had  and he used to keep his seals on itÃ¢  this was not before the split ring had been foundÃ¢  i said to him   it is a most shocking thing Ã¢  he said   it is  i am innocent of it  but it would not look so bad against me had not the property been found in my pantry Ã¢  i said it looked very suspiciousÃ¢  he said   i shall say nothing  at least  until i hear that the whole truth is told Ã¢  he was then taken up stairs and searchedÃ¢  he was then taken into strict custodyÃ¢  next morning i again searched the scullery  adjoining the pantry  along with shaw  the police sergeantÃ¢  i assisted in taking down a platerack  and behind the leaden pipe  which runs close against the wall  and adjoining the plate rack  i found this sealÃ¢   producing it Ã¢  i immediately showed it to shaw  and marked itÃ¢  it has a coat of arms on itÃ¢  it was entirely concealed between the pipe and the wallÃ¢  there was just room for it between the pipe and the wallÃ¢  i searched another leaden pipe in the scullery  leading to the pantry  and found this signet ring behind itÃ¢   producing it Ã¢  it was behind the same pipe as the seal was found behindÃ¢  the ring was bent with the pressureÃ¢  it was squeezed down behind the pipeÃ¢  the ring part was bent down exactly as it is nowÃ¢  it was close to the pipe  so that it could not be seen without feeling thereÃ¢  i was in the pantry on wednesday  the 13th  when the flooring was taken upÃ¢  i took the carpenter thereÃ¢   i had still continued searching the drains and parts  and found nothing Ã¢  it it a wooden floorÃ¢  from under the second board that was removed  which required some force to take up  the plumber pulled a handful of rubbish  among which was this sovereign   producing it    which he gave to me  and i marked itÃ¢  it was close to the door of the pantry into the sculleryÃ¢  on the following morning  thursday  the 14th  i and cronin went into the dining room  and saw tedman  and in consequence of what he informed us  we went up stairs  and in a portmanteau  in the prisoner s bed room  i found these two handkerchiefs  one cotton  and one silk  near the top of the portmanteau  and likewise in the same portmanteau  this shirt frontÃ¢   producing them Ã¢  the handkerchiefs are both marked  b c Ã¢  there were a great many other articles of wearing apparel in the portmanteauÃ¢  i saw some spots or marks of blood on both the handkerchiefsÃ¢  there are several spotsÃ¢  they are dirty handkerchiefsÃ¢  i was present some days before this when that portmanteau was examinedÃ¢  i attended to the examination that was then made of itÃ¢  i could not swear that i noticed either of these things thenÃ¢  i did not find any shirt any where  that this front would matchÃ¢  the handkerchiefs and front are is preciselyÃ¢Å“  the same state as when i found them cross examined bymr  philips q  was there any body present at the conversation you had with the prisoner  a  there was not q  did you tell him  in the course of that conversation  that he was sure to be hanged or transported  a  i never made use of such a word q  and the prisoner did not upon that tell you he would speak nothing farther to you whatever  a  he did notÃ¢  i have stated the facts word for word that passed between the prisoner and meÃ¢  i did not say   do you suppose for a moment that a stranger would have come and put these things behind the skirting board Ã¢  nothing of the kind  and the prisoner did not say   it is very strange Ã¢  cronin was with me when i searched the portmanteau  on the 14thÃ¢  i believe it was shaw that i saw search the portmanteau some time beforeÃ¢  i will not be certain  but i know it was searchedÃ¢  i am not sure it was not shaw and cronin  or shaw and staple  i was busy searching another part of the room  and did not pay much attention to itÃ¢  i assisted in the examinationÃ¢  i could see what was going onÃ¢  that might be three days before the 14thÃ¢  it was some time between saturday and the 14thÃ¢  saturday was the 9thÃ¢  i believe the prisoner was sent to prison on sunday night  the 10thÃ¢  i cannot state whether the search was on sunday  because nothing transpired to bring any thing to my recollectionÃ¢  i helped to search the trunkÃ¢  we were searching it for several things  as a good deal of property was missing thenÃ¢  i knew the trunk had been searched on the 6th q  and you went to look for spoons and forks  on the 9th  a  i went to look for several thingsÃ¢  there was no bloody shirt foundÃ¢  i did not know what might be foundÃ¢  the inspector was as likely to overlook a thing  as meÃ¢  i thought i might find the forks and spoonsÃ¢  it was on the 8th that i knew the box had been searchedÃ¢  i did not know it had been searched on the 6thÃ¢  it was on the friday  the day mr  pearse found the property that he and shaw searched itÃ¢  i never heard of tedman searching it on the 6th  not up to this instantÃ¢  i did hear of inspector pearse and sergeant shaw searching it on the 8th q  and you went on the 9th  hoping to find a bloody shirt  and forks  and spoons  and some of the missing things  a  i do not know about hopeÃ¢  i went to see if i could find any thingÃ¢  i went to search what i could find  or for any marks of any thing bloody  that is what i went to look forÃ¢  i suppose it was searched with that same object  on the 8thÃ¢  i suppose inspector pearse and sergeant shaw would not fill the stations they do  if they were not officers of some reputationÃ¢  i have stated that i found the two handkerchiefs very near the top of the trunkÃ¢  i did not overlook themÃ¢  i found them directlyÃ¢  i took up one handkerchief first  and i and cronin took it to the windowÃ¢  i did not take any thing else to the window before i took the handkerchief  because the rest was linen  and we could seeÃ¢  i did not expect any thing was on itÃ¢  i took it to see if there was any thing on itÃ¢  i could not expect about it  i did not knowÃ¢  i took the other to the window in the same wayÃ¢  i searched the whole of the boxÃ¢  it was not lockedÃ¢  the room door was not lockedÃ¢  i did not notice whether there was a lock on itÃ¢  i had no charge of the trunkÃ¢  there were a great many police in the houseÃ¢  sergeant pullen is in the house nowÃ¢  superintendent baker  and police constable humphries  and one or two of the c divisionÃ¢  i should think there are eight or ten altogetherÃ¢  i will not swear to oneÃ¢  the handkerchiefs were lying very near the top  no one could search the portmanteau without seeing them  if they had any eyesÃ¢  i found the shirt front after i found the handkerchiefsÃ¢  near the middle  a little below  under the handkerchiefsÃ¢  i should consider a torn shirt front was a thing that would attract attentionÃ¢  it attracted my attentionÃ¢  i do not see how any one could miss seeing it  i could not  i knowÃ¢  if a person took each article one by one  out of the trunk  i do not think he could have missed seeing it  or the handkerchiefs either  if they had been thereÃ¢  i do not think the prisoner was in the house when i searched the trunk after the 9thÃ¢  i cannot tell what day it wasÃ¢  i think it was after the sunday  but i could not say what day it wasÃ¢  i do not think it was on sundayÃ¢  i think it was on monday morningÃ¢  i believe it was shaw and humphries who searched it with meÃ¢  they searched more particular than i didÃ¢  i was searching other placesÃ¢  i helped a littleÃ¢  i mean to say i did not search the box minutely myselfÃ¢  i saw them searchingÃ¢  i was searching other places at the same time there  a band box  and other thingsÃ¢  they appeared to me to be minutely searching the boxÃ¢  i observed none of these things on that dayÃ¢  the prisoner was certainly not in the house on the mondayÃ¢  any body might have access to that room  for what i knowÃ¢  my duty was below stairsÃ¢  i found the door openÃ¢  i cannot tell whether every body might have had access on that morning  for i was not thereÃ¢  i have not brought the trunk hereÃ¢  it is a moderate sized travelling portmanteauÃ¢  i found it strappedÃ¢  there was one strap on itÃ¢  it was buckledÃ¢  it was not locked  but there was one strapÃ¢  it was about eleven o clock on the morning of the 14th  that i went to search itÃ¢  i cannot tell whether the other time was on the monday  or notÃ¢  i cannot tell what o clock it wasÃ¢  if i could tell you what o clock it was  i could tell you the exact dayÃ¢  i think it must have been in the afternoonÃ¢  i should say it was in the afternoon  after two o clockÃ¢  it could not have been many days before the 14th  because monday would be the 11thÃ¢  if i knew how many days it was  i could swear to the dayÃ¢  i cannot tell whether it was two days before mr  bodkin q  how many windows are there in the prisoner s sleeping room  a  oneÃ¢  the portmanteauÃ¢Å“  was standing near to the window  but it was more towards the middle of the room when i saw itÃ¢  opposite the dressing tableÃ¢  when i lifted up the lid of the portmanteau  the lid went against the table  in a line with the windowÃ¢   pointing out the situation on the plan Ã¢  the window is at the back of the houseÃ¢  the front of the portmanteau was from me when i went into the roomÃ¢  as you enter the room  the portmanteau was on the left hand side  and the window tooÃ¢  i should not think any person could fail to see those handkerchief when they looked into the portmanteauÃ¢  i took them to the window to examine whether there was any mark on them  because they are darkÃ¢  there was not light enough at the portmanteau to distinguish whether there were any marks on them court q  what is the size of the room  a  a very small room indeed  just big enough to hold a little bedstead  a table  and two or three chairsÃ¢  it is a small back attic frederick shaw police sergeant e8   i went to lord william russell s house on friday  the 8th of may  and assisted in searching the pantry that afternoonÃ¢  on the following day  saturday  i saw collier find a gold seal behind the pipe  and a seal ring bent behind the water pipe in the sculleryÃ¢  the sink had been taken up in the pantry  and taken away  when i got thereÃ¢  about five o clock on the saturday afternoon i searchedthe pantry  near the hearth  and found this gold locket close to the joist of the flooringÃ¢   producing it Ã¢  the stone hearth had been taken upÃ¢  i was sifting the dust  and among it turned over the gold locket court q  were the joists of the floor taken up as well as the hearth  a  only the hearthÃ¢  i found this close to the joists cross examined bymr  phillips q  had you ever searched the prisoner s box  or assisted to search it  a  i did on friday afternoon  the 8th  between five and six o clockÃ¢  i assisted inspector pearse to search it  to see if we could find any thing to lead to a discoveryÃ¢  our search was a minute oneÃ¢  we do not make a careless search when our object is to find any thing suspiciousÃ¢  i paid every attention my duty required me to payÃ¢  no one else was in the room  when we searched it on the 8th  but me and pearseÃ¢  we took all the things out of the box one by oneÃ¢  we took each article up in our hands  and placed it on the bedÃ¢  we left nothing behind that we considered suspiciousÃ¢  we took every thing out  and put it on the bed  so as to bee the box was empty and contained nothing moreÃ¢  i am sure nobody was in the room with me  except pearse  at the time we were searching the boxÃ¢  i did not search it again after the 8th  that i am sure ofÃ¢  i never searched or assisted to search it after the prisoner was seat to prisonÃ¢  i never searched it with collier s assistance  nor in company with humphries or croninÃ¢  my only companion at my only search was mr  pearseÃ¢  the portmanteau is a good sized oneÃ¢  it is hereÃ¢   produced Ã¢  the initials  f b c  are on itÃ¢  the prisoner s room is a small oneÃ¢  i was near the window when i examined the portmanteauÃ¢  the room was perfectly light enough to see any thing mr  bodkin q  do you remember whether any thing was taken to the window in order to examine it by the strong light of the window  a  i do not recollect that there wasÃ¢  the bed was on the right as you went into the roomÃ¢  the portmanteau was in the centre of the room  near the fire place  when i went up stairsÃ¢  when i took the things out  they were put on the bed away from the windowÃ¢  i do not recollect that i saw any handkerchiefs among the things that were taken out mr  phillips q  you found no breast of a shirt torn  in the search you made  a  i recollect seeing one in the portmanteauÃ¢  i saw one very similar to thisÃ¢   looking at the shirt front produced Ã¢  i think it is the sameÃ¢  i recollect seeing a front there of this descriptionÃ¢  i do not know that i saw these two handkerchiefs thereÃ¢  there were a great number of things in the portmanteauÃ¢  i will not speak positively to the handkerchiefsÃ¢  this front i recollect seeing on the 8thÃ¢  mr  pearse was with meÃ¢  i had this front in my handÃ¢  i remember there were a good many neck handkerchiefs in the portmanteauÃ¢  i do not recollect seeing any of this description paul cronin police constable c158   i went to lord william russell s house on wednesday morning  the 6th of may  about half past seven o clock  but i did not go into the house till half past tenÃ¢  i was outside the door till thenÃ¢  i remained there every day and night until saturdayÃ¢  i assisted mr  pearse in searching the pantry  and saw him pull down two boards of the skirting  and take out a gold clasp purseÃ¢  he found it just on the corner inside the skirting boardÃ¢  i also saw him draw out a ribbon  and attached to it was a waterloo medalÃ¢  he took that from behind the second skirtingÃ¢  i next saw him draw out a 10l  noteÃ¢  i believe mr  pearse took possession of all that propertyÃ¢  it was on friday the 8th  that mr  pearse made this search  and found the property  about eleven o clock in the day  or about twelve or one  as near as i can recollectÃ¢  on tuesday  the 12th  i went there again  in the morning  with mr  pearseÃ¢  i had left the house after saturday nightÃ¢  i had done nothing in the house from saturday night till tuesday morningÃ¢  on the 12th i went into the scullery  leading from the pantry  and examined the flooring  particularly under a small vault attached to the sculleryÃ¢  i passed my hand along the boards composing the flooring of the scullery  and in doing so my finger struck against what i considered to be a ringÃ¢  it is a very dark small place attached to the sculleryÃ¢  i drew my hand out in the darkÃ¢  i had no lightÃ¢  i drew it out with some difficulty  and it appeared to me to be part of a watch key with the pipe and ring broken offÃ¢  this is itÃ¢   producing it Ã¢  i went again on the following day  wednesdayÃ¢  i first searched in the pantry  and afterwards up in a yardÃ¢  there are two yards  one above the otherÃ¢  it was in the upper yard i searchedÃ¢  i went there with collier for the purpose of raising some stones which appeared looseÃ¢  after raising the stones i saw a leaden sink encased with woodÃ¢   produced Ã¢  it came from the pantryÃ¢  i had seen it in the butler s pantryÃ¢  it was a fixture there  just over the place where pearse found the propertyÃ¢  i saw the sink taken down  and  i believe  it was placed in the yard afterwardsÃ¢  i looked at the sink round the edgesÃ¢  it appeared to me that the lead had been turned up and put down againÃ¢  not the whole of it  only a small place in frontÃ¢  i turned up the front with an iron chisel which i had in my hand  looked inside  and saw a watch thereÃ¢  i immediately called collier  who saw me take the watch outÃ¢  i kept it and sealed it up almost immediately afterwardsÃ¢  i produced it at bow street  and have had it ever since in my custodyÃ¢  it was in the same state as it is now  with the glass out of it james ellis i am at present in the service of the earl of mansfield  i was for two years and eight months in the service of the late lord william russellÃ¢  i left i believe on the 1st of april this yearÃ¢  the prisoner succeeded me in my situationÃ¢  i remained two days there to initiate him into his dutiesÃ¢  i am perfectly well acquainted with three out of these five ringsÃ¢  they belonged to lord william russell  and it is my firm belief that the other two belonged to himÃ¢  he was always in the habit of wearing those five rings dailyÃ¢  when his lordship retired to bed  they were usually placed on a small dressing table in the bed room  which stood between the two further windowsÃ¢   looking at the watch Ã¢  i used to wind up lord russell s watch for him  on a common average  five days out of the sevenÃ¢  i firmly believe this to be the watch which i was always in the habit of winding upÃ¢  that i placed at night always in a watch stand on a little table by the side of his lordship s bedÃ¢  here is a name inside it  but it appears to me to be the maker s nameÃ¢  i never noticed that his lordship had a watch in which his own name was engravedÃ¢  this name is engraved on the inside case of the watchÃ¢  i am perfectly acquainted with this seal  these two watchkeys  and this signet ringÃ¢   looking at them Ã¢  they were all the property of his lordshipÃ¢  this split ring appears to be the same which was always worn to the watchÃ¢  it is rather broken  but it is a similar ring to what his lordship usedÃ¢  the watch key also appears to be the same  but a portion of it it goneÃ¢  his lordship had a chased key of precisely the same patternÃ¢  i know that his lordship had a waterloo medal  but i never examined it  and he had a ribbon attached to itÃ¢  this russia leather box was called the cash boxÃ¢  i know that  and these note cases i can speak positively toÃ¢  hislordship had always foreign gold coins in the cash box  but i never examined themÃ¢  it was always evident to me they were not english moneyÃ¢  i remember to have seen this miniature in lord russell s possessionÃ¢  it was always in the small cash boxÃ¢  i never saw it any where else while i was in the serviceÃ¢  this gold pencil case i know perfectly well by marks which i now see on itÃ¢  that was his lordship sÃ¢  he was in the habit of carrying it in his pocket every dayÃ¢  this tooth pick case appears to me precisely similar to the one always carried by lord william russellÃ¢  they were generally placed on the small table at night  where the rings were placedÃ¢  this sugar sifter i am positive toÃ¢  it was always used by me when in lord russell s service  and this dish cover is the top of a hash dish always used by me in lord william s serviceÃ¢  this cloak appears to be his lordship s evening cloakÃ¢  it appears precisely the same as when i left his lordship s serviceÃ¢  a card is sown in itÃ¢  i have seen a locket in his lordship s possessionÃ¢   looking at the one found in the pantry Ã¢  it might have resembled this  but i am not quite positive of itÃ¢  i never by any chance had much cause to examine it  only if his lordship left it in any part of the house  he desired me to fetch itÃ¢  i am not at all positive to the locketÃ¢  it was a similar one court q  you say you have seen his lordship with a locket resembling this  but cannot take on yourself to say this is the identical locket  a  no  i cannot mr  adolphus q  we understand a rushlight was lighted in his lordship s room every evening  a  every night when his lordship retired to bedÃ¢  his lordship was never in the habit of reading in bed at all  to my knowledgeÃ¢  i never observed itÃ¢  the candle  by which his lordship went to bed  was always put out by me when  his lordship retired to bed  and put on the table by the side of the rushlightÃ¢  i never observed the candle to have been left to burn out in the socketÃ¢  his lordship was particularly careful on the subject of fireÃ¢  he has very often cautioned meÃ¢  i remember his lordship s returning from a short visit to richmondÃ¢  i saw the prisoner several times after that  before i left londonÃ¢  probably two or three timesÃ¢  once i recollect very well the prisoner asking me if i had any recollection of his lordship s having a locketÃ¢  i told him i hadÃ¢  he then said his lordship had lost the locket while out of town at richmondÃ¢  i said i wondered how it could be lost  as his lordship always carried it in the note caseÃ¢  the prisoner also said he could not account for its being lost  unless it had fallen from the pocket of his lordship s clothes while he was brushing themÃ¢  he said his lordship had written  or was going to write  to mr ellis  the proprietor of the hotel at richmond  concerning the locketÃ¢  there are only two days in particular that i recollect having conversation with the prisonerÃ¢  one day was shortly after the return from richmond  and the other the monday before the murderÃ¢  i rather think this conversation was a day or two after the return from richmondÃ¢  when i left lord russell s service  i handed over to the prisoner the plate that was in my careÃ¢  i had a list of it  which i gave to the commissioners  i believeÃ¢   the plate box was here produced Ã¢  the list is inside thisÃ¢  i examined the contents of the box at the house with my list  before it went to the bankinghouseÃ¢  this is my own listÃ¢  it is the list by which i checked the plate before i delivered it over to the prisonerÃ¢  i examined the contents of the chest with this list shortly after this eventÃ¢  four table spoons  four large forks  four dessert spoons  and two tea spoons were then missingÃ¢  the greater portionof the plate was always kept in my own bed room at the top of the house  in a drawer belonging to a large dressing table  standing in the valet s roomÃ¢  they were generally deposited there  but not alwaysÃ¢  i considered it the safest place for themÃ¢  the plate in ordinary use was kept in a cupboard in the pantry belowÃ¢   several articles of plate were here produced by mr  cumming Ã¢  to my firm belief these are the articles that were missing from the house  according to my listÃ¢  they correspond in quantity and size  and they have the crest of lord russell on themÃ¢  the same as i have always seen richard mattison harrison i am chief clerk in the banking house of hoare and co   fleet street  the baroness de clifford keeps an account thereÃ¢  mr  wing  the solicitor  draws on her account occasionallyÃ¢  i remember paying a cheque of mr  wing s on the 25th of april lastÃ¢  i can tell from an entry which i have  that this 10l  note was one of the notes i paid on that occasionÃ¢   this was the note found concealed in the pantry Ã¢  the cheque was for 200l  and was drawn by thomas wingÃ¢  here is the chequeÃ¢   producing it Ã¢  it is dated the 25th of april  1840 cross examined bymr  clarkson q  have you the book here in which the original entry is  a  yes court q  do you know who you paid it to  a  i cannot say  but this is one of the notes i paid for that cheque thomas wing i am solicitor to the baroness de cliffordÃ¢  i drew a cheque on her bankers  by virtue of her authority  on the 25th of april this yearÃ¢  i received the amount myselfÃ¢  i do not know whether this is one of the notes i received on that occasionÃ¢  i received fifteen 10l  and ten 5l  notesÃ¢  i kept them till i saw the baroness on the monday after  and then gave the notes i received from mr  harrison to her ladyshipÃ¢  i gave the self same notes to her ladyship on the monday morning following the saturday on which i received themÃ¢  the deceased s name was lord william russell  by courtesy lady clifford i am related to the late lord william russellÃ¢  i am the widow of one of his sonsÃ¢  i remember  on the 27th of april  receiving from mr  wing some bank notes amounting to 200l Ã¢  among them were some 10l  notesÃ¢  on the 29th of april i gave one of those 10l  notes to the late lord william russellÃ¢  it was given for a charitable purpose  court q  was there any thing to be done with it  a  it was to be given to lady sarah baileyÃ¢  i went abroad on the friday  the day after lady sarah bailey i am related by marriage to the late lord william russellÃ¢  he married my sister  i knew him for many yearsÃ¢  i reside at hampton court palaceÃ¢  while lord russell was residing at richmond this spring he came over to see me many times q  do you remember on any occasion any thing happening about a locket  a  yesÃ¢  he left the locket on my table while he went to chapel in the afternoon  and when he returned from chapel i gave him the locket againÃ¢  he put it into the left hand pocket of his coat  an upper pocket when i first saw it it was in a brown and blue letter case which was worked by his daughter q  had his lordship a great regard for that locket  a  i suppose so  because he wrote for itÃ¢  i bad never seen it before that timeÃ¢   looking at the letter case Ã¢  this is the letter case  and to my belief this is the locketÃ¢   looking at it Ã¢  there is hair in itÃ¢  i cannot say whose hair it isÃ¢  it is tied with a piece of blue silkÃ¢  lord william russell wrote to me to inquire about the locketÃ¢  i think he wrote for it from camden hillÃ¢  i wrote to him in answer to his noteÃ¢  he was at richmond at the time  but my letter to him was directed to norfolk streetÃ¢  i have no particular reason for knowing who was in attendance on him during his stay at richmondÃ¢  i did not see his servant when he came over to me at hampton court court q  what was the occasion of lord russell s taking the locket out  a  he gave me a letter to read from that very caseÃ¢  i cannot remember whether the locket fell out  but when he was gone

attendance on lord russellÃ¢  on the 25th  after lord russell had left my house  i received this letter from himon the subject of a locketÃ¢  in consequence of that letter i made immediate inquiry  and search was made after the articleÃ¢  nothing was heard of it  nor ever has been sinceÃ¢  i cannot find the envelope of that letter any whereÃ¢  the seal of it was from the travellers  clubÃ¢  i

directionsÃ¢  this is his lordship s watchÃ¢   looking at it Ã¢  i know this watch key  by having taken it off the last time the watch was repairedÃ¢  it is the watchkey belonging to lord william

charlotte peolaine my husband s name is louisÃ¢  he is a frenchmanÃ¢  i am an englishwomanÃ¢  we keep the hotel dieppe  leicester place  leicester squareÃ¢  i know the prisonerÃ¢  i think it is about four years ago that i knew himÃ¢  he came to a situation  to take a place in the hotel as waiterÃ¢  i do not recollect whether he told me his nameÃ¢  we used to call him jeanÃ¢  french is generally spoken at our hotelÃ¢  he staid with us a month or five weeks  it was not long q  since that time has he continued to be acquainted with you  coming in occasionally  a  i never saw him since till about six weeks ago i thinkÃ¢  he then came to our hotelÃ¢  it was on a sunday eveningÃ¢  he merely asked me how i wasÃ¢  he staid about two minutes q  how did he introduce himself to you  do you remember  a  he knocked at the room door  i said   come in    and he walked inÃ¢  i did not recognise who he was at the momentÃ¢  it was some time since i had seen himÃ¢  he said   do not you recollect me   Ã¢  i said   no  i do not Ã¢  he said   i am john  that used to live with you some time  over in the square Ã¢  i recollected him thenÃ¢  he staid a few minutes  and then went awayÃ¢  i believe i asked him if he was in a situation  and he said   yes Ã¢  i said   i am very glad of it Ã¢  he said   with a gentleman Ã¢  he did not tell me his nameÃ¢  i saw him again  i think it was on the sunday week afterwards  or the sunday fortnightÃ¢  it was on a sunday eveningÃ¢  he merely came in and asked me how i wasÃ¢  it was in the eveningÃ¢  he had a paper parcel in his handÃ¢  he asked me if i would take care of it till the tuesday following  and he would call for itÃ¢  i said  certainly i would  and he left it with me  and went awayÃ¢  i put the parcel in a closet  and locked it upÃ¢  it is a closet i use generallyÃ¢  i had no notion at that time what the parcel containedÃ¢  it was a sort of round parcel  tied with a string  and sealed q  did he call for it on the tuesday following  a  i never saw him since until to dayÃ¢  i heard once or twice of the murder of lord william russell q  had the parcel been left with you before you heard of the murder  or not  a  oh yesÃ¢  i took the parcel out of the closet yesterday morning  for the first timeÃ¢  i was induced to take it out  on account of what my cousin brought up stairs in a french newspaperÃ¢  he read it to me  and showed it to meÃ¢  in consequence of that i had some conversation with my cousin  and sent for mr  gardie  who lives in king streetÃ¢  he is a chaser and modeller  i believeÃ¢  i also sent for mr  cumming  an attorney  who is an intimate friend of oursÃ¢  mr  vincent  my husband s partner  was also presentÃ¢  he is the person who gave me the information out of the french paperÃ¢  the parcel wasopened in the presence of those personsÃ¢  it had never been opened before  from the moment it came into my possessionÃ¢   mr  cumming here produced the parcel Ã¢  this is the parcelÃ¢  this is the brown paper that was over itÃ¢  the parcel contained spoons and forks  silver i suppose  two pairs of new stockings  and two instruments  which i do not know the name of  a pair of dirty socks  a jacket  and something  i do not know what they call it  i think it is tow  round the plateÃ¢  it is like ravelled rope  that would have the effect of preventing the plate being felt  or from jinglingÃ¢  it did not make the least noiseÃ¢  mr  cumming immediately wrote down on a sheet of paper what there was  fastened it up again  and brought it here  i believeÃ¢  before he fastened it up  we signed the inventory  to attest what it contained cross examined bymr  phillips q  about what a clock in the day yesterday was this  a  about four  i thinkÃ¢  we have a billiard table in our

taken out of it  i think i can swear thatÃ¢  i never heard of itÃ¢  there was never any gang of suspected persons taken out of our house by the police  nor any person q  what did you mean by saying you think you could swear it  a  because i am never down in the billiard room myself  but i never beard any noiseÃ¢  i do not think there is any gambling house in leicester place but ours  and ours is not a gambling houseÃ¢  there are not a great many gambling houses in leicester place that i am aware ofÃ¢  we have lived there two years next septemberÃ¢  i never inquired much whether there were gambling houses thereÃ¢  our house is very much frequented by foreignersÃ¢  there are generally a good many thereÃ¢  the prisoner went by the name of jeanin our serviceÃ¢  that was the name i gave himÃ¢  i do not know whether his name was jeanÃ¢  i called him so for convenience sakeÃ¢  because it would be easy for us all in the houseÃ¢  i never knew him by any other nameÃ¢  we do not take in

tied up with string  and the string sealedÃ¢  my advice was asked on the subject of opening itÃ¢  i opened it myself  and made this list of the articles that were in itÃ¢  i then did it up againÃ¢  before doing so  i noticed a crest on the forks and spoonsÃ¢  after doing it up  i proceeded to a bookseller s shop  in order that i might see by roe peerage book the treat of the bedford family  and having satisfied myself that a goat  which was on the spoons  was the crest of that family  i immediately proceeded from ridgeway s  the bookseller s shop  to marlborough street  for the purpose of seeking the advice of a magistrate  and to be relieved from the possession of the parcelÃ¢  i saw an officer  who introduced me to the clerk of the magistrate  and i made a communication to himÃ¢  in consequence of a communication from him  i immediately came here in a cabÃ¢  i arrived here about six o clockÃ¢  i sent in a communication by note to the solicitor for the prosecution  and was directed to come inÃ¢  i then made a communication to mr  wing and mr  hoblerÃ¢  he paper which i brought in some time ago  contained a portion of what the brown paper parcel contained  but i had given up the brown paper  and some other articles  having first put my initials on them  by the direction of mr  hobler  to an officerÃ¢  the spoons  and forks  and plate  which i have brought in  were in that parcelÃ¢  here are my initials on the cover of the parcelÃ¢  there has been an address on the cover  which is nearly erasedÃ¢  besides the spoons and forks  there is a gold ear apparatus

frederick pollock  mr  wightman  mr  adolphus  andmr  gurney  conducted the prosecution samuel perks  i am a builder  i reside in london at the present time  and had done so one week before the 10th of june last  about six o clock n the evening of the 10th of june i was standing by the column under the portico of the north wing of buckingham palaceÃ¢  i had gone there about half an hour beforeÃ¢  i was standing waiting for the approach of the queenÃ¢  i saw her majesty come out of the wooden gate of the north wing   i believe it is called the garden gate   in a low open carriage  accompanied by prince albertÃ¢  the carriage turned to the left  up constitution hillÃ¢  there was a postilion and four horsesÃ¢  the top of the carriage about leached even with my foreheadÃ¢  i am not acquainted with the name of itÃ¢  it was a low open one with four wheelsÃ¢  i was on the left hand side of the carriageÃ¢  there were no military in attendance on the carriageÃ¢  there were four out riders  two a little in advance  and the others a distance behindÃ¢  there were no other attendants on the carriage  that i am aware of q  did you  on that day  see the prisoner any where  a  the first i saw of him was after the carriage came outÃ¢  i turned short across the corner  up constitution hill  to get a second view of her majesty  and then i saw oxfordÃ¢  he was on the right side of the carriage  on the footpath next the iron railing court  q  he was on the off side of the carriage  a  yes  on the right side mr  solicitor general  q  how near were you to him when you first observed him  a  on the opposite side of the road  about the same distance as from here to the opposite wall of the courtÃ¢  he was walking along very slowly  with his arms folded under his breast  and his coat buttonedÃ¢  he was in advance of the carriageÃ¢  the carriage moved onÃ¢  the prisoner gave a nod with his head when the carriage came on  he turned round  and gave a nod with his head in the direction of the carriageÃ¢  he was then about ten or twelve yards before the carriageÃ¢  the carriage was moving towards himÃ¢  as the carriage advanced he continued to move in the same directionÃ¢  i observed him the moment the carriage passedÃ¢  i was about a foot behind the carriage  and from the singular way he nodded with his head previous to the advance of the carriage  it attracted my attentionÃ¢  when the carriage had advanced  i ran in the direction of it  and the prisoner drew a pistol with his right hand from his left breast pocket  presented it at their majesties  and firedÃ¢  i was just behind the carriage when he discharged the pistolÃ¢  there was about one foot space between me and the carriageÃ¢  i was within a foot of itÃ¢  the prisoner was about five or six yards from the carriage when he discharged the pistol  and on the right side of itÃ¢  the report of the pistol attracted my attention  and i had a distinct whizzing or buzzing before my eyes  between my face and the carriageÃ¢  i was on the left side of the carriage  just at the back of her majestyÃ¢  the prisoner was on the right all the timeÃ¢  the moment he fired the pistol  he turned himself round  as if to see if any one was behind him  he then set himself back again  drew a second pistol with his left hand from his right breast  presented it across the one he had already fired  andwhich he bad in his right hand  and fired  at both times taking very deliberate aims q  what distance was the carriage from oxford when he discharged the second pistol  a  the carriage was then about three or four yards in advance of where he fired the firstÃ¢  after the second pistol was fired  the two witnesses named lowe immediately ran  and joshua lowe seized hold of the prisonerÃ¢  the lowes were somewhere behind me when i first observed themÃ¢  at the moment of the firing  joshua lowe ran towards the prisoner  caught hold of him by the two arms  and albert lowe caught hold of the two pistols and wrenched them from the hands of the prisonerÃ¢  a man named clayton came behind albert lowe  and seeing the pistols in his hands  thought he was the person who had committed the act  and said to him   you confounded scoundrel   i think were the words  and wrenched one of the pistols from lowe  upon which the prisoner exclaimed   it was me  i did it Ã¢  the carriage proceededÃ¢  we took the prisoner along the road  and delivered him into the hands of two policemenÃ¢  the two lowes and clayton helped to take himÃ¢  i held the back of the collar of his coatÃ¢  a great many were about at the time court  q  where did you find a policeman  how far had you gone  a  i suppose about twenty yards  between twenty and thirty cross examined bymr  sidney taylor  q  i think you say the prisoner was on the pathway  a  he wasÃ¢  the pathway is very little elevated from the carriage roadÃ¢  i suppose the footpath is about the height of the centre of the roadÃ¢  it is very little elevated above that part of the road next the footpath  it is nearly levelÃ¢  the channel is about six  or it may be eight inches deepÃ¢  i do not think the footpath is a foot above that part of the roadÃ¢  i do not suppose the channel is more than eight inches mr  solicitor general  q  is there any channel or gutter by the side of the pathway  a  yes  a slight oneÃ¢  there is an iron grating very near where it occurredÃ¢  the descent of the pathway into that channel is about eight inches court  q  it was an open carriage her majesty was riding inÃ¢  did her majesty sit above the line of the carriage  a  yesÃ¢  i suppose the line of the carriage was about the centre of her backÃ¢  the whole of that would be exposed to the sight of any body behind the carriageÃ¢  her majesty sat on the left  side  and prince  albert on the rightÃ¢  he was nearest to the prisonerÃ¢  the top of my head was about level with the top of the back of the carriage q  then the whole carriage was between the prisoner and you when he fired the first shot  a  i was exactly a foot behind the carriageÃ¢  the prisoner stood on the right  just opposite joshua lowe  i am a spectacle makerÃ¢  my place of business is in copthall courtÃ¢  my residence is in london wall  i was in the park on the evening of the 10th of juneÃ¢  my attention was attracted by the cortege of the queen and the carriage her majesty was inÃ¢  i saw her majesty sitting in the carriage on the left sideÃ¢  prince albert was on the rightÃ¢  i was running by the side of the carriage on the left side  the wall side  the side on which the queen sat  and heard the report of fire armsÃ¢  i was then about three yards from the carriage i should think q  were you in advance of it  or behind  or what  a  at the side  exactly at the side of the carriageÃ¢  the noise attracted my attention in that direction  and i saw the smoke ascendÃ¢  the carriage passed on a shortdistance  and then i saw the prisoner with a pistol in his right handÃ¢  his right arm droppedÃ¢  he turned round as if to see if any body was at his elbow  and to me it appeared that he pointed the second pistol across his right handÃ¢  he fired it towards the carriage q  how long had he the pistol in that direction before he fired it  a  not an instantÃ¢  my nephew was with meÃ¢  i immediately ran across and seized the prisonerÃ¢  my nephew seized the pistolsÃ¢  some one came up i believe and took a pistol out of my nephew s hand at the time  and collared my nephew  upon which the prisoner said   it was i  it was me that did it Ã¢  i had at the time he said that  got hold of him by the collar and his armÃ¢  we walked about twenty yards  and the policemen came up  and going along the road towards the station house  after the policemen had come up  i said to my nephew   look out  albert  i dare say he has some friends Ã¢  the prisoner turned round  and said   you are right  i have  Ã¢  i kept hold of him till we got down to gardener s lane station house  and then he was taken into the station house by the policemenÃ¢  myself and two or three more had hold of him at the timeÃ¢  i never let  go cross examined bymr  bodkin  q  did you see the queen s carriage leave the palace  a  i didÃ¢  i should think it had got about a hundred and fifty yards  or it might be a little more  up constitution hill  before this occurredÃ¢  the road is wider thereÃ¢  the carriage was going slowlyÃ¢  i had seen her majesty when the carriage left the palace and followed it for the purpose of seeing her againÃ¢  i did not notice whether a good many other persons did the sameÃ¢  there was a general rushÃ¢  i was on the left hand sideÃ¢  the garden wall of the palace is on that sideÃ¢  it is not very high  about eight feet  or more than thatÃ¢  i did not notice it particularlyÃ¢  it is a wall of considerable heightÃ¢  it is a brick wallÃ¢  the footpath is on the other side of the road  and a very little channel divides the footpath from the roadÃ¢  when i saw the prisoner he was standing on the footpathÃ¢  i think the footpath is about six inches higher than the road  but the centre of the road is about levelÃ¢  the queen s carriage was more in the centre of the roadÃ¢  i believe there is a footpath on both sides of the roadÃ¢  i think the carriage was in the centre as near as possible q  about what distance do you judge the prisoner to have stood from the carriage at the time you saw the smoke  a  about three yardsÃ¢  the carriage was quite open  and was going at a slow paceÃ¢  that three yards would be shortened i think about three quarters of a yard by stretching out his arm q  then the muzzle of the pistol would be within little more than two yards of the carriage  a  i should say soÃ¢  he appeared to take a deliberate aimÃ¢  when i saw him fire he was about a yard from the railing which encloses the green parkÃ¢  the nearest gate by which any one could enter the  green park was about one hundred and fifty yards from where this happenedÃ¢  the railing is quite open q  so as to afford an opportunity for a person to fire from the park side if he had chosen  a  if he had chosenÃ¢  i did not observe what attendants her majesty hadÃ¢  there were outriders  i think before as well as behindÃ¢  i did not see the witness perks till after the occurrenceÃ¢  i was on a slow run when i heard the discharge of the first pistolÃ¢  i did not observe several persons running or walking on the same side of the carriage as meÃ¢  i have no doubt there were persons about  but i did not see themÃ¢  at the time my nephew was seized i had hold of the prisoner onthe pathway up against the railingÃ¢  i had hold of him before he said   it is i Ã¢  he appeared desirous that it should be known he was the person who did itÃ¢  we had got a short distance from where this occurred  when i told my nephew to be cautious  for probably he had friends q  either when the prisoner said   yes  i have friends   or at any other time in the transaction  did you see any persons whatever in his company  a  not in his companyÃ¢  there were plenty had got hold of himÃ¢  i had an idea at the time that the witness clayton was with him court  q  can you give any notion what distance of time there was between the firing of the two pistols  a  merely to turn round and to place his handÃ¢  the carriage was moving onÃ¢  i suppose at the last firing the carriage was about eight yards in advance of himÃ¢  he fired the second pistol up the road  after the carriageÃ¢  there were a few persons in front of the carriage albert lowe  i am the nephew of joshua lowe  on the 10th of june i was with my uncle on constitution hill in the parkÃ¢  i saw her majesty come in her carriage from the palaceÃ¢  i followed the carriage up the road and had not proceeded far before i heard the report of a pistolÃ¢  my uncle and i were running by the side of each otherÃ¢  i did not know from whence the sound proceeded  but turning my head round i saw the prisoner holding a pistol in the direction of the carriage  and he firedÃ¢  that was the second pistolÃ¢  i thought he held it in his right handÃ¢  upon his firing the second pistol my uncle ran across the road with meÃ¢  my uncle seized him  and i took both pistols from the prisonerÃ¢  a roan came up  caught hold of me  and said   you confounded rascal  it was you  Ã¢  i had then the pistols in my handsÃ¢  the man took one pistol from my hand the prisoner then cried out   i did it   or  it was me that did it Ã¢  something to that effectÃ¢  we were going to take him to the station house  and the police came upÃ¢  as we were going along  my uncle told me to look out  for be thought he had some friends about himÃ¢  he turned his head round and said   you are right  i have  Ã¢  i delivered the pistol up which clayton did not take from me  to the policeÃ¢  i do not know whether it was the one i saw fired q  can you tell how far the carriage had proceeded from buckingham palace when the first shot was fired  a  i thought about thirty yards  at first  but i have since been to see the place  and it is about 100Ã¢  i did not see the prisoner fire the first pistol  but when be fired the last he was about five yards from the carriage  i should think elizabeth stokeley  i am housekeeper to lord bexley  i was on constitution hill  on wednesday the 10th of june  going from the palaceÃ¢  i was on the side next the wallÃ¢  i did not see the queen s faceÃ¢  i saw her carriageÃ¢  my attention was first attracted by seeing the carriage approachÃ¢  i turned round on seeing it approach  and saw the prisoner walking in this positionÃ¢   with his arms crossed over his breast Ã¢  he was walking by the railing  on the opposite side to me  nearly oppositeÃ¢  immediately on the carriage approaching i saw him draw his hand  and present  and then fireÃ¢  i was not so near to the carriage then as i was afterwardsÃ¢  it came on a few paces before the second fireÃ¢  when he fired the first pistol i saw him change his hands  and immediately present the second pistol  and fire it q  in what direction did it appear to you that he presented the pistol  a  immediately opposite where the queen was sittingÃ¢  the flash of thepistol came almost immediately over the queen s headÃ¢  the queen was crouchingÃ¢  she rather crouched  and the prince stoodÃ¢  i think  to the best of my knowledge  the queen first rose  and by what i observed  the prince rather pressed her down  and it was immediately before the second pistol was fired that her majesty crouchedÃ¢  it was the second flash which appeared to come over the queen s head  and it came close past me  the flash didÃ¢  it seemed something that whizzed past my ear  as i stood  it seemed like something quick passing my ear  but what i could not sayÃ¢  at the time the second pistol was fired i was very near to the queen s carriageÃ¢  i was as close to the edge of the pavement as i could be  and the queen s carriage was coming along the centre of the roadÃ¢  i was near as could be  within a yard of the carriage court  q  all this was at the second firing  a  yes mr  wightman  q  when the second pistol was fired  what did you see the prisoner do  a  i saw him drop his hands  and standÃ¢  a gentleman rode up on horsebackÃ¢  the carriage drove off a few paces  then stopped  and the gentleman rode up to the carriage and spokeÃ¢  the prisoner was surrounded  and i saw no more court  q  where was the prisoner standing at the time the second pistol was fired  a  he was standing very near the carriageÃ¢  he was on the opposite side of the carriage to me  on the railing sideÃ¢  the second pistol was fired across the roadÃ¢  he was facing the carriage  and backed to get his aimÃ¢  he was more behind the carriage when he fired the second pistol cross examined bymr  sidney taylor  q  was there any person near you at the time  a  a little girlÃ¢  from the time i saw this my attention was so fixed upon it that i saw nothing elseÃ¢  i had not seen several persons about the carriage just beforeÃ¢  i did not notice themÃ¢  i saw the prisoner drawing the pistol  and my attention was fixed upon thatÃ¢  the first thing  when i turned round  was the prisoner drawing his hand out with the pistolÃ¢  i could not see how far in the rear of the carriage he was when the second pistol was firedÃ¢  he was by the carriageÃ¢  he was standing by the railingÃ¢  perhaps he might be two yards in the rear of the carriage when he fired the second pistolÃ¢  i observed a wall thereÃ¢  i saw the second pistol pointedÃ¢  i should say it was pointed right across towards the wallÃ¢  i cannot tell how the first pistol was pointedÃ¢  i did not take notice of the height of that wallÃ¢  my back was towards itÃ¢  i cannot say bow far i was from the wallÃ¢  i was as far as could beÃ¢  i was near the roadÃ¢  i cannot say how far that is from the wallÃ¢  there are several trees about thereÃ¢  they are rather thick before the footpath on the left side of the wallÃ¢  i could see the wall through the stems of the trees mr  wightman  q  you say the flash appeared to pass over the queen s head and before your eyes  a  no  not before my eyesÃ¢  it came just over the head of the carriage  and whizzed past my ear q  what do you mean by the flash  a  the light and the smokeÃ¢  i cannot explain what it was that whizzed by my earÃ¢  it was my right ear william clayton  i am a cabinet maker  and live in princes street  leicester square  i was on constitution hill on the evening of the 10th of juneÃ¢  when the queen s carriage approached i was standing about 200 yards from the marble arch of the palace  on the side where the wall is  the garden sideÃ¢  i heard ft pistol firedÃ¢  the carriagewas then about twenty eight yards from me  or it might be thirty  nearer to the palace than i wasÃ¢  i was in company with my brother  and on hearing the report i said   good gÃ¢  d  jack   and instantly ran off towards the spotÃ¢  i crossed the road  and ran down to where i heard the reportÃ¢  when i came abreast of the horses i heard a second reportÃ¢  i was in the act of crossing the road when i heard the second reportÃ¢  i ran on  i never ceasedÃ¢  the horses stopped  and her majesty arose in the carriage  and looked round  with no fear on her countenance neitherÃ¢  her majesty s back was towards the palaceÃ¢  i was crying out   where are they who did it  Ã¢  i ran on and could not see how long her majesty s carriage stoppedÃ¢  i did not see it goÃ¢  i passed the carriage  and ran on to the spot where i saw the smokeÃ¢  i saw two persons  one with his back to the railing  on the park sideÃ¢  i inquired   where are they who did it  Ã¢  a female said   that is the man who did it Ã¢  she pointed to the two  but i judged it to be the man standing with his back to the railing  which was albert loweÃ¢  i said   you confounded rascal  how dare you shoot at our queen  Ã¢  the prisoner heard me say soÃ¢  he was nearer to me than albert lowe wasÃ¢  i spoke in a loud voiceÃ¢  the prisoner said   i did it  i give myself up  i will go quietly Ã¢  i took hold of his coatÃ¢  the mob rushed in  and seized me  and knocked the pistol out of my hand on the groundÃ¢  i stooped down to pick it up  expecting to resume my hold  when i was seized right and left  back and before  was kicked and torn  and my shirt collar out  and was taken into custodyÃ¢  the police took me to the station house  where i was locked up in a cell and searchedÃ¢  when i was brought from the cell i saw the prisoner in the inspector s officeÃ¢  i asked for a draught of cold water  what with the struggling and the dust that was created  i felt a great wish for a drop of cold waterÃ¢  the prisoner said   and i should like a drop of cold water Ã¢  i was walking up and down  and in passing him  be turned round and said   is the queen hurt  Ã¢  he turned his head towards me  and said soÃ¢  i said to him   what did you put in the barrels  Ã¢  he said   i have answered a dozen questions  there have been a dozen persons asking me questions  and i shall answer no more  q  do you know what became of the pistols that were taken from him  a  there was a pistol lying on the table  one was brought in by the policeman  that was locked up with me in the cellÃ¢  i took hold of that pistol which was lying on the table  saying   i have put my little finger into the muzzle of the barrel  and have wiped out the powder  and is there any here  Ã¢  i asked myself that questionÃ¢  i put my finger into both pistols  but the one i first put my finger into i markedÃ¢  that pistol came from the hands of albert loweÃ¢  i took it from himÃ¢  it was not taken from me when i was knocked downÃ¢  it came on the ground  but i picked it up  and resumed my hold againÃ¢  one part of the time the policeman had it  and at another time i had it  but it never went out of my sight till i had marked itÃ¢  the police made their appearance  i should judge two minutes after the first shotÃ¢  i had got the pistol before the police cameÃ¢  i can say that the pistol i marked was one of the pistols taken from the prisonerÃ¢  it was in the hands of both the prisoner and albert loweÃ¢  this is the pistolÃ¢   looking at one Ã¢  there is a mark on the barrel court  q  how far is the place where you seized albert lowe and the prisoner from the carriage  a  fifteen or eighteen yards from where the carriage stoppedÃ¢  the second pistol was fired when i was abreast of thehorsesÃ¢  the carriage drew across the road immediately on the second pistol being firedÃ¢  the pulling up of horses  going at the rate of six or eight miles an hour  would take six or seven yardsÃ¢  i should say the second pistol was fired the distance of full eight or ten yards from the carriage charles brown  i am a policeman  on the afternoon of the 10th of june  i was on duty at buckingham palace  about six o clock i was sent on an errand to the south wingÃ¢  i saw the queen s carriage going up constituation hillÃ¢  i was in front of the steps at the south wingÃ¢  shortly after i saw the queen s carriage i heard a shot firedÃ¢  i immediately ran towards where the sound proceeded fromÃ¢  it appeared to me to proceed from constitution hillÃ¢  as i went towards the spot i met a gentleman on horseback  who spoke to meÃ¢  my attention was attracted by a mob of people  who had hold of a personÃ¢  before that a second shot had been firedÃ¢  it was after i heard the second shot that the gentleman on horseback spoke to meÃ¢  i was going towards the carriage when i heard the second shotÃ¢  i ob of people having hold of the prisonerÃ¢  the two lowes had hold of him  and several others besidesÃ¢  on my coming up  several voices  i do not know whether it was the lowes  said   this is the man  and i laid hold of himÃ¢  nothing more was said by the persons presentÃ¢  the prisoner said   you have no occasion to use violence  i am the person  i will go quietly  Ã¢  i had merely laid hold of his collar and his left arm when he said thatÃ¢  i proceeded with him to the station houseÃ¢  shortly afterwards some person remarked   perhaps there might be more of them Ã¢  the prisoner replied   i have friends  Ã¢  smith  a policeman  came up  we went in front of the wellington barracks  and as we got opposite the barracks some person said   i wonder whether there was any balls in the pistols  or no Ã¢  the prisoner made answer   if the ball had come in contact with your head  if it was between the carriage  you would have known it Ã¢  i took him to the station house  and he was searched by me and another constableÃ¢  the other constable took from him  in my presence  a key  a knife  and 2s  6d  in silverÃ¢  i have the keyÃ¢  i found a piece of wadding in his trowsers  pocketÃ¢  i looked at it  and saw the mark of the hammer on one side and the cap on the otherÃ¢  i asked him what it was forÃ¢  he said   to prevent the pistol going off   as he did not wish to hurt himselfÃ¢  it would prevent the pistol going off  by putting it between the hammer and the capÃ¢  it had been so usedÃ¢  he also said  if i was to go up to the park  where it occurred  i should find the other piece of waddingÃ¢  while i was in the inspector s room different gentlemen came into the roomÃ¢  a question was put   i cannot say whether it was to the prisoner   whether there were any balls in the pistolsÃ¢  the prisoner said there were balls in the pistolsÃ¢  next day i made search in the garden  on the other side of the wall  but was not able to find any thing cross examined bymr  sidney taylor  q  now when the question was put  as to whether there was any ball in the pistols  how many policemen were in the room  a  i cannot sayÃ¢  i do not think there was any body but the inspector and myselfÃ¢  there were a number of gentlemen there q  had various persons been asking the prisoner questions  a  not asking the prisoner questions  but asking one another  as they came in q  do you mean to say  that questions were not put to the prisoner himself  a  not by the parties while i was thereÃ¢  i did not hear any one put questions to him except the inspectorÃ¢  he asked him questionsÃ¢  he asked his name and where he came fromÃ¢  i believe he asked him something about the pistols q  is it the practice of the police  to whom you belong  to interrogate prisoners as to the fact of any crime with which they are charged  a  i believe notÃ¢  the inspector merely asked him where he came fromÃ¢  he was not interrogated by the inspector  in my presence  as to whether there were balls in the pistolsÃ¢  he asked where he got the pistols fromÃ¢  the question about the balls was not put to the prisoner  but the gentlemen asked whether the pistols were loaded with ballÃ¢  the prisoner was not asked the question  he was in custody at the time q  you say he stated there were balls in the pistols  what were his words  a  as near as i can recollect  his words were   the pistols were loaded  q  he did not say there were balls in them  but the pistols were loaded a   there were balls in the pistols  q  the pistols were loaded    were those his words  a  no  not exactlyÃ¢  he distinctly said there were balls in the pistols q  he said they were loaded  were those his words  a   the pistols were loaded with balls   those were the words  as near as i can judgeÃ¢  i will not swear to the exact wordsÃ¢  i cannot tell the exact height of the wall of the gardenÃ¢  i should say it was eighteen or twenty feet highÃ¢  i searched in the gardenÃ¢  i made a very minute searchÃ¢  not all over itÃ¢  within about 100 yards in length  and about twenty five in breadthÃ¢  what i should suppose to be the range of the pistol ballÃ¢  i did not find anyÃ¢  i searched on the other side of the wall for a short timeÃ¢  about two hours after the firingÃ¢  the police sergeant and three or four men were there when i searchedÃ¢  i assisted in the search for a short timeÃ¢  i stopped there for about a quarter of an hour q  what mode of searching was used  a  we kept moving over it with our hands  and then swept it with a broomÃ¢  that search extended about twenty five yards in length  and five or six yards in widthÃ¢  there was no ball found in the dust while i was thereÃ¢  i did not see all the dust siftedÃ¢  it was taken down to the palace  and sifted thereÃ¢  i saw it brought down to be siftedÃ¢  i did not make any further searchÃ¢  there are several trees about thereÃ¢  i was not examined before the privy council  and have not stated any thing before the privy council as to balls in the pistols q  had you told any body before the examination by the privy council  that you had heard the prisoner state the pistols were loaded with ball  a  yes  i told mr  maule  the solicitor court  q  how many people were there in the room at the time he said there were balls in the pistols  a  from ten to twelve personsÃ¢  he said it out loudÃ¢  he was in my custody at the time  in one corner of the roomÃ¢  i should think he said it loud enough for other people to hear as well as meÃ¢  the people were talking as to whether there were balls  one said   i wonder whether there was one   and he said   there was  charles smith  i am a policeman  i was on duty on the 10th of june  at buckingham palaceÃ¢  i remember the queen coming outÃ¢  shortly after the queen came out  i heard a noise  which attracted my attentionÃ¢  it proceeded from the direction of constitution hillÃ¢  i did not proceed towards the spot from whence the sound came  till i heard a second reportÃ¢  it was like the report of fire armsÃ¢  i then proceeded to the spot  and saw the prisoner there  in the custody of charles brownÃ¢  lowe had hold ofhimÃ¢  i saw a pistol in young lowe s handÃ¢  i proceeded towards the station house with the prisonerÃ¢  going along  i asked where the pistols wereÃ¢  as we were going in front of the palace  young lowe pulled one from his bosom  and said   here is the pistol Ã¢  i said   take care of it Ã¢  some one in the crowd asked if the pistols were loaded with ballÃ¢  the prisoner made answer   if your head had come in contact with the ball  you would have found there was a hall in the pistol  cross examined bymr  bodkin  q  was not the phrase   if your head had been at the head of the pistol  you would have known whether it was loaded or not   a  it was notÃ¢  somebody in the crowd asked if the pistols were loaded with ballsÃ¢  the answer was   if your head had come in contact with the balls  you would have found there was ball in the pistol Ã¢  those were the very wordsÃ¢  brown was thereÃ¢  i have no doubt he heard it william smith  i am a policeman  i was in the green park on the 10th of june  in the middle of the parkÃ¢  it is separated from constitution hill by a railingÃ¢  my attention was directed to the  carriage as the queen was passingÃ¢  i heard the report of a pistol  and saw the smoke of itÃ¢  i hastened to the spot  and saw a number of people running in that direction  and i saw the prisoner present a pistol  and fire it towards her majesty s carriageÃ¢  i was fifty or sixty yards from the carriage at the time the second pistol was firedÃ¢  i ran  and got over the railingÃ¢  they are iron palisades  about five feet high  or more  with spikes at the topÃ¢  i had some difficulty in getting overÃ¢  i hurt my hand in getting overÃ¢  the prisoner was then in custodyÃ¢  the witness clayton had a pistol in his possession at the time  and i took him into custody  to the station houseÃ¢  i took the pistol away from himÃ¢  he was put into the cell  and was there about five minutesÃ¢  i then commenced searching himÃ¢  inspector baites came in  and commenced searching himÃ¢  he took out his card  and gave it to the inspectorÃ¢  i then gave the pistol into his hand to mark  and he gave it into the hands of the inspector cross examined bymr  sidney taylor  q  when your attention was directed towards the carriage  did you see any out riders  a  yesÃ¢  i did not notice where they wereÃ¢  whether before or behind  or on one side the carriageÃ¢  i have been in the police almost twelve monthsÃ¢  there were not many people near the carriage when my attention was directed to it  but afterwards there wereÃ¢  i cannot tell how many there were at firstÃ¢  people were scattered about on constitution hillÃ¢  the people were very anxious to get a sight of the queenÃ¢  there were not so very many there at firstÃ¢  i cannot give any idea about how many there wereÃ¢  i saw the prisoner present the second pistol  and fire itÃ¢  he was ten or twelve yards from the carriage when he fired it  on the right side of the carriageÃ¢  the pistol was presented in a slant direction towards the top of constitution hillÃ¢  i did not search afterwards for the bullet frederick garrett  i am in the employ of mr  william hayes  who is a general salesman  he has two shops  in blackfriars road  where i attend as shopman  i remember the rumour of the queen having been fired atÃ¢  about three weeks or a month before that i saw the prisoner at our shop in blackfriars roadÃ¢  he bought a pair of pistols and a powder flask of meÃ¢   looking at the pistols Ã¢  these are the sort of pistols mr  hayes was in the habit of keepingÃ¢  this has mr  hayes s private mark on itÃ¢  we had such pistols as that recently arrivedÃ¢  these are the pistols thatwere parted with to the prisonerÃ¢  i asked him two guineas for them  they were marked two guineasÃ¢  he said he wanted to know what distance they would carryÃ¢  i said  about twenty or thirty yardsÃ¢  he said  if i would take two sovereigns he would have themÃ¢  i said  if he would not give more i must take itÃ¢  he then asked about a powder flaskÃ¢  i believe i took one from outside the shopÃ¢  he gave me two shillings for thatÃ¢  i also gave him two bags to put the pistols inÃ¢  these are the bagsÃ¢   looking at them Ã¢  i know them againÃ¢  this is the powder flaskÃ¢   produced Ã¢  i had never seen him before that day  to my knowledgeÃ¢  he was about ten minutes bargaining for and paying for the pistolsÃ¢  i had such observation of him as to be quite sure of him when i saw him againÃ¢  i knew the pistol bags and powder flask again when they  were producedÃ¢  they were brought to me about three days after the queen was shot at  and i knew them again immediately cross examined bymr  bodkin  q  you do not tell us the exact day this bargaining took place  a  i entered it on the slate when they were bought  and mr  hayes took it off the slate and entered it in the bookÃ¢  no one was present in the shop besides myselfÃ¢  i think it was before one o clock in the dayÃ¢  the prisoner was alone mr  adolphus  q  when you serve in that shop your master is at the other  a  yes william sampson hayes  i keep a shop in blackfriars road  where fire arms are sold  i have also another shop  i keep a day bookÃ¢  i have not got it hereÃ¢  i had no order to produce itÃ¢  i remember hearing of the queen being fired atÃ¢  i heard of it the same dayÃ¢  i do not know how long before that it was that i made the entry in the day bookÃ¢  it was before thatÃ¢   looking at the pistols Ã¢  here is my private mark on these pistolsÃ¢  i take the entries which i put in my book off the slateÃ¢  they are entered by the young man on the slate  and next morning i copy from the slate into the bookÃ¢  that is my usual courseÃ¢  i remember an entry being made on the slate of a pair of pistolsÃ¢  that was on monday  the 4th of may john joseph gray  my father keeps a shop at no  10  bridge road  lambeth  i assist him in his business  i am the principal there  we sell  among other things  caps for pistols  i remember the prisoner calling at our shop  on either tuesday or wednesday  the 3rd of june lastÃ¢  he brought half a hundred caps of meÃ¢  he asked if i kept bulletsÃ¢  i told him no  but recommended him to a gunsmith in the boroughÃ¢  he wanted to know if i had any small canisters of gunpowderÃ¢  i had  and i showed him our half pound canistersÃ¢  he said they were not small enough  he wanted a small canister  he should like a quarter of a pound  if he couldÃ¢  he tried four or five of the caps while he was with meÃ¢  he only showed me one pistol  but i believe he had a pair with himÃ¢  i found some caps that fitted itÃ¢  i had known the prisoner some years back  in the same road where i am living nowÃ¢  i had been to school with him  but for bow long i cannot sayÃ¢  to the best of my recollection it was eight or nine years agoÃ¢  when he came into the shop i feigned not to know himÃ¢  he asked me if my name was not john grayÃ¢  i told him it wasÃ¢    well   he said   don t you remember any one of the name of oxford  Ã¢  i said   yes  i certainly do  i went to school with a person of that name Ã¢  he said   well  i am the same Ã¢  i asked him what he had been doing with himselfÃ¢  he said he had then lately come from birmingham  but he had been in the public line court  q  how long were you at school with him  a  i cannot say  i did think i was at school with him for about a twelvemonth  but my schoolmaster came forward and proved he was only there five weeks  i might have been mistaken by his once being a neighbourÃ¢  i cannot say how long i have known him  it is so many years ago  it is impossible for me to say  i was very young at the timeÃ¢  i lived about twenty houses on the opposite side of the way to him  in westminster bridge road  he lived about twenty houses lower down  nearer the marsh gate q  you say you feigned not to know him when he came in  what was your reason for that  a  i did not wish to make up the acquaintance again with himÃ¢  i did not observe any thing odd in his appearance  not the least sir henry wheatley  i am keeper of her majesty s privy purse  when i heard of her majesty being fired at  i went to the station house where the prisoner was in custodyÃ¢  i saw him in the cellÃ¢  he came forward when the door was opened  and asked me   is the queen hurt  Ã¢  those were the first words that were spokenÃ¢  lord uxbridge was with meÃ¢  some conversation ensuedÃ¢  we asked him in what situation he wasÃ¢  he stated he was a bar boy  and had been out of place about ten daysÃ¢  i do not recollect that he said any thing about a pistol  or about the shootingÃ¢  he said he had come into the park at four o clock  and had seen the prince come from woolwich  at least  he supposed if was from  woolwich court  q  that was between six and seven o clock  a  about half past six the earl of uxbridge  on the 10th of june i saw the prisonerÃ¢  from the opening of the cell door  where i found him  he addressed me by saying   is the queen hurt  Ã¢  i said   how dare you ask such a question  Ã¢  he said he had been in a public house in oxford street for  about four months  and had left it about a fortnightÃ¢  he said he had been shooting a great deal latelyÃ¢  a very good shot with a pistol  but a better shot with a rifleÃ¢  he said the pistols had been given to him on the 3rd of may  and something else also  which he went on to inform us was money  and  he could have as much of it as he pleasedÃ¢  i then said to him   you have how fulfilled your engagement Ã¢  he replied   no  i have not Ã¢  i said   you have  sir  as far as the attempt goes Ã¢  to that he was silent cross examined bymr  bodkin  q  did sir henry wheatley remain with you during this conversation  a  during the first part  but he retired into the officeÃ¢  i went to the station house immediately on hearing of the occurrenceÃ¢  there were one or two policemen thereÃ¢  it is a very narrow passageÃ¢  i think sir thomas freemantle came in  and a gentleman  who i afterwards heard was mr  thistleÃ¢  no question had been put to the prisoner before he asked whether her majesty was hurtÃ¢  what followed was in answer to questions generally put by myselfÃ¢  he was probably not aware that i was an officer in the queen s householdÃ¢  i did not mention who i was  nor did sir henry wheatley in my hearingÃ¢  there was no reluctance whatever to answer the questions which i put to him samuel taylor  i am acquainted with the prisonerÃ¢  i have known him about twelve monthsÃ¢  i recollect the rumour of the queen being fired atÃ¢  i saw the prisoner the evening before thatÃ¢  he showed me a pistol  and said he had been firing at a targetÃ¢  he did not say when or where he had been firing at itÃ¢  he showed me nothing except the pistolÃ¢  i asked whether it was loadedÃ¢  he replied that it was loaded thomas greenwood lawrence  i live in victoria street  white conduit fields  and am a perfumer  in the employ of delacroix  of bond street  i know a public house in oxford street  called the hog in the poundÃ¢  it is at the corner of south molton streetÃ¢  i know the prisonerÃ¢  he was barman to mr  robinson  the proprietor of that public house  when i first knew himÃ¢  it might be about february when i first knew him as barman thereÃ¢  on easter sunday i went with him and one roach to hyde park  about four o clock in the afternoon  from four to half past fiveÃ¢  at hyde park corner i said to the prisoner   i suppose the people are looking for the queen Ã¢  he replied   they will be disappointed  as she is at windsor Ã¢  we got back to the hog in the pound about half past five o clockÃ¢  roach and curling were in company with usÃ¢  i believe the prisoner quitted the hog in the pound about the let of mayÃ¢  i have frequented that house for the last two years  up to the present timeÃ¢  one evening  after he had left the service  he was in the parlour there  and he said he had lost a half sovereign on a bet respecting the shot at the bull s eye  at the shooting gallery in leicester squareÃ¢  he showed me a flattened ballÃ¢  i beard a person named roach remark that he was more fit to shoot at a hay stack than at a target the honourable john oliver murray  i am brother to lord eli bank  i was on constitution hill on wednesday afternoon  the 10th of june  on horsebackÃ¢  when the first pistol was fired the prisoner was close to me  as near as he is now  or very little furtherÃ¢  after the report of the first shot my horse plunged up into the air  being a very high spirited animalÃ¢  i saw the prisoner put his hand into his breast  draw out a second pistol  and take a most deliberate aim  in the direction of the queen s phaeton  which was about fifteen or twenty yards from where i wasÃ¢  as soon as i got any power over my horse i tried to prevent his firing the second shotÃ¢  when he did fire it i was as near to him as i am nowÃ¢  he stood with his back to the railing  with a smileÃ¢  some persons came over the park  and down constitution hill  and seized himÃ¢  he did not offer the slightest resistanceÃ¢  i immediately afterwards looked at the wallÃ¢  i was the first person that went to the wallÃ¢  i noticed a mark which i supposed to be the mark of the bulletÃ¢  it was a white mark on the dark wall  as large as the palm of my handÃ¢  at that time colonel fox came upÃ¢  i pointed it out to him  and to lord belfast alsoÃ¢  the mark was about five feet from the ground  and rather in a slanting direction from where the prisoner stood q  did it appear to you such a mark as a bullet would have made  a  i have not the slightest doubt of it  in my own mind cross examined bymr  bodkin  q  did you not observe any other mark on the wall  a  there was a kind of angular mark on the wall  but a very old oneÃ¢  it was near this markÃ¢  i took notice of that to mark the spot q  have the goodness to describe what kind of mark this was  a  the wall was darkÃ¢  it was a white round mark upon that wall  as a bullet would makeÃ¢  it was much larger than a bulletÃ¢  it was as if a piece of the brick was knocked out by the force of the ball  or whatever made the markÃ¢  i looked about on the ground for the bullet before any one came  but found none  but being fired in a slanting direction it mightÃ¢  q  did you find any piece of brick  a  i did not look for anyÃ¢  i was looking about the ground for the bullet mr  attorney general  q  i do not know whether you have beenaccustomed to see marks made on a wall by the firing a ballet against it  a  i have  frequentlyÃ¢  the first shot was fired in a slanting direction  the second shot was almost before meÃ¢  the carriage never stoppedÃ¢  it went on up constitution hill  in the direction of grosvenor place court  q  was the place on the wall as big as the palm of your hand  a  i think nearly as largeÃ¢  that would be nearly the whole flattening of the bulletÃ¢  the ball would be a perfectly flat surface if it made so large a mark as thatÃ¢  i should say the piece of brick was broken by the force of the bullet on the wall the honourable william owned stanley  i was in the park on the 10th of june lastÃ¢  i was coming straight down in the direction where the shot was fired  from the reservoir at the top of the parkÃ¢  it might be about two hundred yards from the spotÃ¢  my attention was called by hearing the report of one pistol first  and a few seconds afterwards a secondÃ¢  as soon as i came down to the rails i tried to get over  but could not for the spikesÃ¢  i then asked what had happened  and asked the bystanders whether there were any marks on the wallÃ¢  i got to the wall about ten minutes afterwardsÃ¢  i have tried since  and it took me about seven minutes to walk roundÃ¢  i have had frequent experience in the mark that a ball would make going against a wallÃ¢  i saw a mark which in my opinion was decidedly such as might have been made by a bulletÃ¢  i have not the pleasure of knowing mr  murray cross examined bymr  sidney taylor  q  have the goodness to describe what sort of mark this was  a  it was rather longer than wideÃ¢  it appeared to me that the bullet had struck thereÃ¢  i could see the part where the bullet bad struck  and a chipped brick  which had broken off about an inch and a halfÃ¢  where the bullet struck it appeared to be circularÃ¢  i examined other parts of the wall  and there appeared to me to be another mark about fourteen yards from that  not quite a similar mark  it appeared to me to be fresh  and such a mark as might have been caused by a bulletÃ¢  i examined about twenty yards on either side  but could find no other mark q  after you had seen these two marks on the wall  did you examine whether there were any bullets underneath the places where the marks were  a  it would have been no useÃ¢  i did examine  hooked down on the ground close to the marks  but found no bullet thereÃ¢  there were three little chimney sweepers thereÃ¢  sir john eustace was with meÃ¢  he examined alsoÃ¢  he walked round with me  and there was an old artillery man thereÃ¢  he examinedÃ¢  he found no bulletÃ¢  he agreed with me q  the artillery man  you  and sir john eustace searched for the bullet  and found none  a  cannot say that i did search for the bullet  for being in an angular direction  the bullet would have glanced offÃ¢  i looked down  but no moreÃ¢  i was looking down for a few seconds by each markÃ¢  i looked down to see if the brick that had chipped off had dropped belowÃ¢  i did not look to see if there was a bullet  because i did not think it likelyÃ¢  i did not see any policeman there at the timeÃ¢  some came up before i leftÃ¢  they did not searchÃ¢  i did not speak to themÃ¢  it was no useÃ¢  they did not search while i was there  to my knowledgeÃ¢  the wall is  i suppose  fourteen or fifteen feet high thereÃ¢  i did not search in the garden sir frederick pollock  q  could you form any judgment in what manner the bullet would be likely to strike the wall  a  yesÃ¢  it appeared to me to have been an angular strikeÃ¢  the moment i came up iasked what had happened  and in consequence of what i heard i did not look for the ball in the immediate neighbourhood court  q  in your opinion decidedly the mark in the wall was produced by what  a  i have no doubt whatever in my own mind that it was produced by a bullet fired from a pistol john william linton  i live with my father in the waterloo road  i am a playmate of the prisoner sÃ¢  i was never at school with himÃ¢  i remember hearing of the queen having been shot atÃ¢  on the monday previous to that the prisoner called on meÃ¢  about a month before that i had been to the strand with himÃ¢  i cannot remember our conversation when he called on me thenÃ¢  he asked me to go with him to the shooting gallery in the strandÃ¢  he showed me some pistolsÃ¢  he did not show me the pistols the first time he called to ask me to goÃ¢  he called one day to ask me to go  and i went with him the next dayÃ¢  he showed me the pistols the day we went to the galleryÃ¢  they were very handsome pistolsÃ¢  they were carved on the stockÃ¢  i did not notice how they were mountedÃ¢  he said a friend had lent them to himÃ¢   looking at the pistols produced Ã¢  i almost think these are the pistols  but i could not swear to themÃ¢  to the best of my knowledge they areÃ¢  i went to the shooting gallery in the strand with himÃ¢  he there shot at the targetÃ¢  he had half a dozen shotsÃ¢  the people at the gallery provide the ballÃ¢  when he called on me the monday before the queen was shot at  he showed me the pistolsÃ¢  they were the same i had seen beforeÃ¢  he said he had been at a much better shooting gallery than the one we first went toÃ¢  he did not say where it wasÃ¢  i understood it was over the waterÃ¢  i mean over the thamesÃ¢  we were then in the waterloo road  and he meant over the water  on the westminster side of the thames court  q  where were you when the conversation took place  a  at my own home in the waterloo road  over the riverÃ¢  i understood him to mean on the westminster side sarah packman  i keep the house no  6  west place  west square  the prisoner lodged at my house  and had done so i think six or seven weeks before the queen was shot atÃ¢  his mother had been there

into the front room one pairÃ¢  it was openÃ¢  i found this box thereÃ¢   producing it Ã¢  it was lockedÃ¢  i opened it with a chisel and hammerÃ¢  i afterwards tried this key to it  and it fitted itÃ¢  i found in it this sword and scabbard  four books  a black crape cap with two red bows  a powder flask containing about three ounces of gunpowder  a razor  a bullet mould  two pistol bags  a memorandum book containing four papers  i also found five bullets  and twelve or fourteen percussion capsÃ¢   producing the articles Ã¢  the bullets that were cast by that mould fitted the pistolsÃ¢  i cast one  and tried it  and it fitted the pistolÃ¢  the bullets that i found loose would roll into the pistols  but they were rather smaller  and did not appear to be cast in that mouldÃ¢  i took the box and the articles to the station houseÃ¢  i showed them to the prisonerÃ¢  hesaid the box was his  and the things that were in itÃ¢  he saw the pocket book and the papersÃ¢  he said those were his alsoÃ¢  he said be intended to have destroyed them in the morning before he went out  bat he had forgotten themÃ¢  the papers were folded up in the pocket book as they are nowÃ¢  they were not

time i was pregnant of the second child  my husband s conduct was dreadful  brutalÃ¢  he neglected me to that i fainted three or four times a day for want of foodÃ¢  he once broke a jug  and threw a piece at meÃ¢  it would have cut my face  but i held up my arm and it cut my armÃ¢  i have the wound nowÃ¢  he annoyed me dreadfully by grimaces while i was pregnant of my second child  and by jumping about like a baboon  and imitating their grimacesÃ¢  that continued during the whole period of my pregnancy of the second childÃ¢  that child was barely born aliveÃ¢  it was a confirmed idiot  and its countenance was precisely as the father looked when he made those grimacesÃ¢  it put its tongue out like he didÃ¢  it lived about between two years and four months  not quite two years and a halfÃ¢  during all that time it had not the least appearance of reasonÃ¢  it never spoke or walkedÃ¢  it was very voraciousÃ¢  it showed no indication of sense or reason at allÃ¢  i continued to suckle that child after the birth of the prisonerÃ¢  it took to the breast two or three days after this boy was bornÃ¢  its cry was not humanÃ¢  it was a sort of moanÃ¢  it was not like a child criesÃ¢  i suckled that child and the prisoner togetherÃ¢  my husband s conduct was much the same during my pregnancy of the prisoner  grimaces and so onÃ¢  i was in tears one day when a lady called  she said   what is the matter  mrs  oxford  Ã¢  i said   he is commencing the same faces he always has done   and she told him it was very wrong of himÃ¢  he once struck a file into my breast  and the milk flew out from the woundÃ¢  there was a stream of milk on the floorÃ¢  that was before the birth of the prisoner  it was whilst i was suckling my first child  and on observing the milk come from the wound  he showed the same indifference that he always didÃ¢  i had not had any quarrel with himÃ¢  he was always tormenting meÃ¢  he delighted in annoying and teasing me q  did you do any thing to provoke him to these extraordinary acts  a  noÃ¢  i was considered too patient  and too attentive to himÃ¢  i was blamed by my parents and many personsÃ¢  he kept a horse at one time  and i have seen him bring the horse into the house  he led it in by the bridle  and he seemed  like a child with a toy  amused at his own follyÃ¢  he brought it into the sitting room  and led it aboutÃ¢  i have frequently applied to him for money for the support of the family  which he has refused  and abused me  and he once knocked me down  and fractured my headÃ¢  i had done nothing more than ask him for money to support the familyÃ¢  i knew he had received many pounds that nightÃ¢  he put 2s  on the tableÃ¢  i said i could not do without moneyÃ¢  he was perfectly soberÃ¢  it was between seven and eight o clock in the eveningÃ¢  i believe it was before the birth of the prisoner that i received the blow which fracturedmy headÃ¢  i cannot say whether it was at the time i was pregnantÃ¢  he cut my head with a quart pot  while i was pregnant with the prisonerÃ¢  he threw it at me  and it cut my straw bonnet through  and cut my headÃ¢  i did not know my head was cut till i felt the blood coming downÃ¢  i do not remember  how far advanced in pregnancy i was then q  was your mind ever at all affected by any violence done to you by your husband  a  when asleep i screamed  and i was obliged to be awoke up in my dreamsÃ¢  that was when my head was fracturedÃ¢  i was carried in by several persons  and when they dressed my head  i attempted to walk  but could not  my head turned round with giddinessÃ¢  that was the day it was doneÃ¢  i was dangerously illÃ¢  i was obliged to have my head shaved and poulticedÃ¢  mr  partridge the surgeon can tell when that was better than iÃ¢  i believe he is hereÃ¢  i remember one day walking with my husbandÃ¢  he left me  saying  he had a box to go off by to morrow  and he must go and finish itÃ¢  he left me at my mother s  on telling me thatÃ¢  after that i went home with the servant and child  and found the house locked upÃ¢  it was not opened to meÃ¢  i went back to my mother sÃ¢  it was afterwards opened  and part of the goods were removed  the house in confusion  and my husband goneÃ¢  he was taken by the authorities of the town next morning  in the act of leaving birmingham  for londonÃ¢  i had not had any quarrel with him at that timeÃ¢  not a word or sentence of angerÃ¢  when i saw him afterwards he did not give me any explanation of his conduct  but he came into my father s house and asked me some questions  which i answered himÃ¢  the persons sitting by wondered how i could speak to himÃ¢  he went away again immediatelyÃ¢  he continued in birmingham for some weeks  and then went to dublin  where he stopped four months  leaving me and my children with my motherÃ¢  at the end of the four months he returned  and sent for me to a lodging house  i of course put out my hand  expecting he would be glad to see me  but he pushed me from himÃ¢  he said nothing particular  only be seemed annoyed at my looking better than when he left meÃ¢  he said soÃ¢  i have heard him reasoned with by his friends as to his conduct  and he said  if any one persuaded him to do any thing  be would act directly oppositeÃ¢  he did not appear to be capable of seeing the folly and wickedness of which he was guiltyÃ¢  he would laugh in the most triumphant manner  and he had i should say  an almost supernatural look with him when he had done wrong  and when i was distressedÃ¢  the day i was put to bed with the first child he kicked me violently because 1 did not agree to something which he proposed to me to doÃ¢  i have known him take poison twice  i believeÃ¢  once he took laudanum  and he was very ill for several days afterwardsÃ¢  he was at my sister s house the same day that he took it in the afternoon  and she spilt half of itÃ¢  he kept his bed several days in conesquenceÃ¢  dr  birt davis was called in in consequenceÃ¢  my husband died on the 10th of june  1829Ã¢  i have seen my husband s father several timesÃ¢  i saw him on the occasion of my husband s death  and the night before he was buried  he said he was determined to lie by the side of his dear boy and he was then in a putrid state  in his coffinÃ¢  i had been obliged to burn vinegar for the last two or three daysÃ¢  his father did not appear to be in a sound state of mindÃ¢  he reproached me for having my husband opened without getting any thing in return  which was very unnatural  i think  in a fatherÃ¢  his conduct was very eccentric on other occasions when i saw himÃ¢  he had a great many peculiarities  the prisoner was born onthe 19th of april  1822Ã¢  for the first seven years of hit life he was under my care q  did you observe any thing remarkable about him from his infancy  a  yes  he would burst out crying when there was no one near him  and no one speaking to him  and he was always very troublesomeÃ¢  it was different to the mere waywardness of childhoodÃ¢  if he sat still or stood still  he would burst out cryingÃ¢  that was after he had learned to walk as well as beforeÃ¢  all children cry  but this was when he was three or four years old  and he has continued to do so through life  to cry without any apparent causeÃ¢  i have known that to be the case up to the time of my going to birmingham  or just before thatÃ¢  that was in the present yearÃ¢  he had a great many other very singular habitsÃ¢  he would get into a violent rage without any cause  he would deliberately break any thing  and willfully destroy any thing that he took in his handÃ¢  he once pointed a pistol at me  that was the first day he brought them homeÃ¢  i should have told you that my husband  during my pregnancy with the prisoner  pointed a gun at my headÃ¢  the prisoner was particularly fond of fire arms and gunpowderÃ¢  i have frequently taken it from him when he was youngÃ¢  he would sometimes play about with other children  and at other  times he would amuse himself with letting off cannons  and he was once very much burnt with gunpowder all over the faceÃ¢  he was very much hurt  that is eight years ago this summerÃ¢  he was at play in the yard with a little boy  and the cannon exploded  and he was very much burntÃ¢  his eyebrows and eye lashes were burnt off  hit hair was very much singed  and his face was a complete massÃ¢  i sat up two nights to wash it with a lotionÃ¢  it was very much hurtÃ¢  he behaved very fractious indeed  and screamed terribly  so that the doctor was angry with him  and gave him a sleeping medicineÃ¢  when i first saw him  after he had burnt himself with the gunpowder  he was crying dreadfullyÃ¢  i was absent at the time  and when i returned i found him washing his face with water q  has he any habit of laughing  a  i have frequently beat him for it when he was much youngerÃ¢  that habit has continued up to the present timeÃ¢  he would laugh hysterically after these gloomy fits and fits of violent passionÃ¢  it is an involuntary laughÃ¢  i told mrs  robinson so the day he leftÃ¢  he was in the habit of alarming me dreadfully  by making strange noises  firing off cannons  and flourishing a great stick before his sister s face  and before the looking glassÃ¢  complaints were made to me by the customers of his laughing  and if i asked him to do any thing when i was in business  be would make such a disturbance  that it used to distress my feelings dreadfully  and annoy the customersÃ¢  i was at that times keeping a pastry cook s shop in the westminster road  but he has annoyed them since then at a coffee house which i afterwards tookÃ¢  when the gentlemen have been reading the newspaper  he has made such a dreadful disturbance that it was very annoying and very distressing to my feelingsÃ¢  the customers complained of itÃ¢  i shut him in the cellar  on one occasion  when i kept the pastry cook s shopÃ¢  the customers came to complain of himÃ¢  i lost a great many of them in consequenceÃ¢  i lost my business entirelyÃ¢  at times he was very affectionate  and at other times the contraryÃ¢  he would break out unawares  and if he wanted any thing  and it was not reached him in a moment  lately  he would strew the room with litters  and throw every thing down that came in his wayÃ¢  he was sometimes very gloomyÃ¢  he would sit  for a long time with his hand tohis head  and not speak  and he would be impatient if i spoke to him  especially if he was reading  and we spoke to him  he would get in a violent rageÃ¢  i went into a situation at mr  prescott s  the bankers  as confidential housekeeper  and was there a year and a halfÃ¢  i saw the prisoner occasionally during that timeÃ¢  i placed him with a person named sandon q  after you left mr  prescott s  and he came from sandon s  did these peculiarities appear to have subsided or increased  a  increased considerablyÃ¢  i could not manage him at allÃ¢  he broke windows to the amount of 29s   and he used to jump on the sofa  and throw the pillows about  and destroy things wilfullyÃ¢  that is eight years agoÃ¢  since that time he has been under my own observation until the last four years  and then he has only been with me for a week or a month occasionally  having gone out to situationsÃ¢  he was with my sister at hounslow first for about two yearsÃ¢  she then kept a public houseÃ¢  she does not nowÃ¢  he then went to mr  minton s  at the shepherd and flock  in london  and from there to mr  farr s  in wilderness rowÃ¢  when at home he was in the habit of going on the roof of the house and throwing at people as they passedÃ¢  he was brought home one night by a policeman  who informed me he had been taken to the station houseÃ¢  he had got behind a carriage  and frightened a lady who was in it by making a great noise  and she was pregnant  and her husband  who was a solicitor  was exceedingly alarmed and angryÃ¢  that was stated in his presenceÃ¢  i went next morning to inquire after the lady s health  and apologizeÃ¢  he took no notice when he heard this accountÃ¢  he did not appear conscious of having done wrongÃ¢  he used to look very indifferently about all these thingsÃ¢  i think this was somewhere about six years ago  between five and sixÃ¢  when he was at home of late  i knew of his having no companion but master linton  who has been examinedÃ¢  he never  to my knowledge  belonged to any club or any meetingÃ¢  i left london for birmingham about four weeks and three days  i think  before this occurredÃ¢  at that time he was out of placeÃ¢  he had left his place just a week before i went to birminghamÃ¢  he received 20l  a year wages where he had beenÃ¢  he did not purchase the clothes he has on with that moneyÃ¢  he has had that coat a long time  he had it just as mrs  minton died  more than two years agoÃ¢  he then had a suit of mourning given him  consequently this coat was savedÃ¢  he has had it in his possession full two years  i should sayÃ¢  i do not know whether it is so much as two yearsÃ¢  i should say he has had these clothes nearly two years q  how lately has any thing occurred between him and you in allusion to macbeth  or any thing of that kind  a  he has always been talking in that manner  repeating parts of plays  from a very little boy  and we used to imitate him because he said it so badlyÃ¢  he wanted to go to sea last winterÃ¢  he wanted me to go to birmingham for 50l  to provide him as a midshipmanÃ¢  i told him of the folly of his going to sea when he knew nothing about nautical affairsÃ¢  he said he should have nothing to do but to walk about the deck and give ordersÃ¢  i said   but you must first learn navigation Ã¢  he said he would allow me half his pay  and how proud i should be of my son when i saw his name in the papers  admiral sir edward oxfordÃ¢  when he brought the pistols home  i said  how could he think of laying his money out in such folly  and he said they were not hisÃ¢  he was saving them for a young manÃ¢  i do not know whether there was any thing in the pistol when he presented it at meÃ¢  he had only just then brought them inÃ¢  he has behaved violently towards meÃ¢  the daybefore i went to birmingham he made my nose bleed by a blow from his fistÃ¢  i was playing with him and turned round  and he hit me on the noseÃ¢  that was not in the course of the playÃ¢  it was afterÃ¢  he turned round suddenly as he was going through the door  and struck at meÃ¢  it hurt me very muchÃ¢  i screamed outÃ¢  the landlady came up stairs  and she said   if i was to strike my mother i should expect my hand to drop off Ã¢  he appeared very sullen q  you know his hand writing  of course  a  yesÃ¢   looking at the paper headed  rules and regulations  found in the prisoner s box Ã¢  i believe this paper is his hand writingÃ¢  all that is his writingÃ¢  i have received two or three notes from him since he has been confinedÃ¢  i have seen him write many timesÃ¢  i have no doubt whatever these are his hand writingÃ¢  these three notesÃ¢   looking at them Ã¢  are also his handwriting cross examined bymr  solicitonr general  q  about this nose bleeding  did he tell you it was an accident  and did you tell mrs  packman that you thought it was an accident  a  i did  because i did not like to appear so severe with himÃ¢  my parents on many occasions witnessed the threats that my husband made to me before our marriageÃ¢  his threats of what be would do to me if i did not marry himÃ¢  the courtship continued  and i afterwards did marry himÃ¢  i do not know the amount of the notes which he burntÃ¢  it was a very large roll of notesÃ¢  i am sure they were notes  because the birmingham notes were very much soiled  and i could tell their appearanceÃ¢  my son  the prisoner  went to school when he was a very little boyÃ¢  walters  i think  was his first schoolmaster s name  i am not quite sureÃ¢  when he went to a master s school i was not thereÃ¢  it was while i was at the situation at mr  prescott s that he was sentÃ¢  i lived in mary ann street  birmingham  at the time of his birthÃ¢  he continued under my care till three months after his father s deathÃ¢  he was seven years old thenÃ¢  he bad been to a small school in the neighbourhood where i livedÃ¢  my husband kicked me at the time of my confinementÃ¢  that was not the occasion upon which my father said he would prosecute himÃ¢  that was when i was in such a dangerous state with the second childÃ¢  i was taken home a month before my confinement  or else there was every reason to suppose i should not have recoveredÃ¢  it was on that occasion my father said he would prosecute himÃ¢  i cannot say exactly how long the prisoner was at school at walter sÃ¢  he next went to mr  robinson s  in the newcut  lambethÃ¢  that is about eight years agoÃ¢  mr  walters was in birminghamÃ¢  he was at mr  robinson s several monthsÃ¢  mr  robinson used to come and complain of his inattentionÃ¢  he next went to a school at camberwell  and remained there a few monthsÃ¢  there were the same complaints then of inattention and wildnessÃ¢  i do not think he went any moreÃ¢  when i was at mr  prescott s  he was placed with george sandon  of birmingham  who married a niece of mineÃ¢  he was there twelve monthsÃ¢  my father had the care of him after thatÃ¢  he remained with my father till eight years agoÃ¢  i do not exactly know how long he remained with my fatherÃ¢  it could not have been much more than a twelve monthÃ¢  part of that time i was with mr  prescott  and the other part in the westminster bridge road  in business as a confectionerÃ¢  when he left my father he came to me in the westminster bridge road  and resided with me till he went to his aunt s at hounslow  four years agoÃ¢  he was barman at his aunt sÃ¢  he continued with her till she failed in business  till he went to mr  minton sÃ¢  the duty of a barman is to serve liquor at the bar  andreceive money  and account for itÃ¢  he went to mr  minton s from his aunt sÃ¢  he was in the same situation there  as barmanÃ¢  he lived there twiceÃ¢  he received wages at his aunt sÃ¢  he lived about four or five months with mr  minton the first timeÃ¢  he then came to my house for a short time  and mr  minton had him back againÃ¢  i cannot say how long he remained there the second timeÃ¢  i should say more than six months  or about six monthsÃ¢  he had 20l  a year thereÃ¢  his next employ was at mr  parr s  in wilderness rowÃ¢  he remained there till mr  parr left the house  and remained a short time with the persons who succeeded mr  parr  to initiate them in the business  for which he received a sovereign  i believeÃ¢  he then came home for a short time  and then went to mr  robinson s  in oxford streetÃ¢  he gave mr  robinson notice  and afterwards he staid for a short time to oblige mr  robinson  till he suited himselfÃ¢  i went there for the first time the very day he left  and asked for himÃ¢  mrs  robinson said he had leftÃ¢  i was rather alarmed  and said   when did he leave  Ã¢  she said   not above an hour ago Ã¢  i said   i hope he has given you satisfaction Ã¢  they said   in every thing but laughing Ã¢  i said   he cannot help it  for i have often boxed his ears for it Ã¢  i did not hear any complaint from mrs  robinson of his breaking the things  but i have often beard it from himselfÃ¢  when he was going to leave mr  minton the first time  i went to know the cause  and he said he made such mistakes in giving change  he liked him in every thing but thatÃ¢  mr  minton is aliveÃ¢  he is not hereÃ¢  the barmaid isÃ¢  it was two or three weeks  i think  before he took him againÃ¢  it was in consequence of the other barman leavingÃ¢  i cannot tell how long exactly he remained the second timeÃ¢  i believe he was recommended from mr  parr s to mr  robinson sÃ¢  my boy told me soÃ¢  i never went to visit him at mr  parr sÃ¢  he went to his aunt s four years ago this summerÃ¢  during that four years  with short intervals he has supported himself in those services q  what were those noises that you speak of that he made at the coffee house  a  why he would cry and roar  like a boy that had been beaten  if i asked him to do any thing  and i put him in the cellar once  and locked him inÃ¢  i have frequently corrected him at other timesÃ¢  i have been compelled to beat him when he was much youngerÃ¢  he was in the habit  as a child in play  of using cannons and gunpowder  occasionally hurting himselfÃ¢  my daughter and i were so much alarmed once that we were both ill by the loud report of a cannonÃ¢  we took it from himÃ¢  i gave it to a lady who was there  and who is now deadÃ¢  he was in the habit of using those

frequent opportunities of observing himÃ¢  the first thing i saw singular about him was on an occasion when he rode into his own parlour on his horseÃ¢  his wife was screaming  and i went over  and saw him riding round  on horsebackÃ¢  i  of course  considered he was not right in his mindÃ¢  i observed peculiarities in his conduct on many occasionsÃ¢  once at dinner he threw the meat and vegetables out of windowÃ¢  i was present at the time  and saw itÃ¢  i was in my own house oppositeÃ¢  my husband and i have frequently said to ourselves that he must be out of his mindÃ¢  that was the general opinionÃ¢  i have very frequently observed peculiarities of conduct in him  though i cannot exactly call them to mindÃ¢  we always considered his acts more the acts of a madman than any thing elseÃ¢  he came from birmingham to london with us in 1820  and there he stopped several weeks  and his actions then were more like a mad man than any thing elseÃ¢  my husband was obliged to tell him he must return  for we could not be troubled with him any longer cross examined bymr  attorney general  q  did he drink a good deal  a  i never saw him drunk  or approaching to isÃ¢  i have seen

the smell that he had swallowed laudanumÃ¢  the bottle was empty when i took it upÃ¢  it was full beforeÃ¢  i called him a fool for acting in that wayÃ¢  he was taken very illÃ¢  i desired he would try to throw it up off his stomachÃ¢  he tried to do so  hut could not do itÃ¢  i got him to bed  and informed his friends of itÃ¢  a car was sent for  and i took him home to his lodgingÃ¢  after that dr  birt davis was sent for to attend himÃ¢  i always considered that he was in a mad state ever since i knew him cross examined bymr  solicitor general  q  pray  when he came and kissed the children

him no questions whateverÃ¢  he and his wife had been parted  perhaps two or three weeks thenÃ¢  he was a gold chaserÃ¢  he carried on that business at birmingham some years  perhaps two or three yearsÃ¢  i cannot say exactlyÃ¢  he came to live in london soon afterÃ¢  he never resided in birmingham after that timeÃ¢  he came to visit the childrenÃ¢  that is allÃ¢  he stopped two or three hoursÃ¢  he did not sleep or live in the house court  q  did you live in london at this time  a  no  in birmingham  but oxford never visited birmingham after he left dr  john birt davis  i am a physician  and reside at birminghamÃ¢  i am also a magistrate of the county  and am coroner for the borough  i attended the husband of mrs  oxford on one occasionÃ¢  he was labouring under symptoms of

practising as a physician from the year 1823Ã¢  i do not think i had ever seen him before that occasionÃ¢  i never saw him afterÃ¢  the two occasions on which i saw him did not afford me any sufficient opportunity of judging as to the state of his mindÃ¢  i heard at that time of his odd conduct to his wifeÃ¢  representations were made to me of his conduct by othersÃ¢  i have been in court during this trial q  have you formed any opinion of the sanity or insanity of the prisoner  a  i have formed an opinion q  supposing a person in the middle of the day  without any suggested motive  to fire a loaded pistol at her majesty  passing along the road in a carriage  to remain on the spot  to declare he was the person who did itÃ¢  to take pains to have that known  and afterwards to enter freely into discussion  and answer any questions put to him on the subject  would you refer such conduct to a sound or unsound state of mind  a  if to that hypothesis were added what i deem a proof of hallucinationÃ¢  court  q  the question is  whether upon those facts alone you should judge a person to be insane  a  i should judge him to be insane upon those facts alone  but i should be stronger in that opinion if i was permittedÃ¢  q  you mean to state  upon your oath  that if you heard those facts stated  you should conclude that the party must be mad  a  i do q  without making any other inquiry  a  yesÃ¢  taking this into consideration  the absence of motive  the absence of precaution  the deliberate owning  and the free discussion afterwards  of his own conduct  criminating himself in that way immediately afterwards  with the danger staring him in the face mr  bodkin  q  suppose  in addition to those circumstances  it was shown  that just before the transaction  the party had written these papers which you have heard read  would that conduct strengthen  or otherwise the inference that you have already told us you draw  a  it would greatly strengthen the inference cross examined bysir f  pollock  q  i collect from what you have said  that you have no distinct recollection of the remedies you prescribed to the prisoner s father  a  i have notÃ¢  i have seen many cases of poisoning by opiumÃ¢  i should say a dozen cases  i cannot rely on my memory for the treatment of that particular caseÃ¢  i did not make any minute of the caseÃ¢  i was called in within a few hours after the laudanum was takenÃ¢  i do not recollect the particulars of the caseÃ¢  it is mainly impressed upon my recollection by the fact of the man being a man of colour  and his residence q  i collect from that  the only particulars you do recollect  are  that sixteen years ago you attended a man of colour  who had taken laudanum  a  that is about the sum of my recollectionÃ¢  i received the information that he had taken laudanum  from othersÃ¢  i cannot say whether he survived the effects of the laudanum by the assistance of any excitement or stimulant  or whether it was removed from his stomach by an emeticÃ¢  i have no recollection of the particulars of his case q  as a medical man  you are perfectly aware that a large dose of laudanum  may be taken without producing death  if a party is stimulated  and kept in motion by counteraction  a  the majority of such cases would recover  when properly treated  when treated in the usual wayÃ¢  he was drowsyÃ¢  i am sure of thatÃ¢  i was not able to form any notion whatever of his state of mind q  you have answered some hypothetical questions put by my learned friend opposite   mr  bodkin  i beg to ask you whether you give that answer from your knowledge  as a physician  or from your experience as a coroner  or as a magistrate  or merely as a member of society  a  i answer as a physicianÃ¢  i think the circumstances which have been supposed  have  medically speaking  a tendency to prove insanity court  q  we do not exactly understand what you mean when you say medically  a  if  as a physician  i was employed to ascertain whether an individual was sane or insane  in whom i found those facts  i should undoubtedly give my opinion that he was insane q  as a physician  you think every crime that is plainly committed to be committed by a mad man  a  nothing of the kind  but a crime committed under all the circumstances of the hypothesis q  what are the circumstances in the crime itself  which you think show madness  a  the crime is committed in open day  it being obviously of great magnitude and danger  of great atrocity  it is committed without any precaution  without any looking out for the means of escape  it is afterwards spoken of openly  so far from concealing the criminating facts  facts which might afford a chance of escape  the existence of the balls is acknowledged  the free discussion of the circumstances  the absence of motiveÃ¢  by the free discussion  i mean a free respondence to the questions put to him immediately afterwards in the cellÃ¢  the questions which lord uxbridge

palaceÃ¢  i first saw it after the first pistol was firedÃ¢  i was  i suppose  sixty or seventy yards from the carriage at that timeÃ¢  the report of the first pistol attracted my attention to itÃ¢  i saw the second pistol firedÃ¢  i should say i had advanced about three paces when the second pistol was firedÃ¢  i was about sixty or seventy yards from the carriage thenÃ¢  i could see how the pistol was directedÃ¢  the prisoner s arm was on a level  i should say  with the top of the carriage  upwardsÃ¢  his arm was as high as the carriageÃ¢  i should say that pistol was fired rather up constitution hill court  q  how far was he from the carriage when you say his arm was in that position  a  about five yards from the carriageÃ¢  he was behind the carriage at that timeÃ¢  the carriage was about five yards in advance richard m donald  i am a corporal in the 90th regiment  i wascoming through the park on the day the queen was fired atÃ¢  i did not see either of the shots fired  nor

where the carriage wasÃ¢  i looked at the garden wall of the palaceÃ¢  it was pointed out to me by a gentleman on horse back  about the spot where he thought the balls bad struck the wallÃ¢  i observed a mark thereÃ¢  in my judgment it was not a mark which had been made by a ball cross examined bymr  attorney general  q  did you see one mark or two  a  two marksÃ¢  three i saw  one lower

not see one fourteen yards off  a  yesÃ¢  i saw one at some distanceÃ¢  i saw three marksÃ¢  i think the one fourteen yards off was also recentÃ¢  it seemed to be quite newly doneÃ¢  it might be by a scraping with a stick by any body who was loitering about dr  hodgkin  i have been a physician about fourteen yearsÃ¢  i have been lecturer on morbid anatomy  and have written some works  lectures on pathological anatomy  and lectures on the promotion of health q  upon all the circumstances of hereditary insanity in the family  supposing a crime is committed without a motive  that the party committing the crime is subject in consequence of that crime  if brought home to him  to lose his life  and that on the commission of that crime  instead of attempting to escape from justice  he delivers himself up to the law and seems reckless of the consequences  are you as a medical man prepared to say whether those circumstances taken together in the commission of the crime  indicate a sane or unsound state of mind in the criminal  a  by themselves i should consider they were circumstances of strong suspicion  but other facts should be sought before one could be warranted in giving a positive opinionÃ¢  those would be facts leading to a strong suspicion that the party was insaneÃ¢  if it should also appear that there was a previous delusion  that would certainly strengthen the caseÃ¢  supposing there was inherent insanity in the family  my opinion  grounded on cases which have occurred  would be strengthened that the individual was insaneÃ¢  striking cases are on record court  q  do you say that all insanity is hereditary  a  no  i have not said so mr  sidney taylor  q  are there instances on record of persons becoming suddenly insane  whose conduct has been previously only eccentric  a  certainly there areÃ¢  supposing  in addition  that there was previous delusion in the mind  my opinion would be that he was unsoundÃ¢  such a form of insanity exists and is recognised cross examined bymr  sir frederick pollock  q  what form of insanity do you call it  a  lesion of the will  it has been called by le mare  insanity connected with the development of the willÃ¢  i should not consider a headstrong person to be under such an influenceÃ¢  i mention lesion of the will  as a term under which a highly reputed writer on insanity has chosen to designate a form of insanity  in which sometimes flagitious acts  sometimes only eccentric acts  are committedÃ¢  it means more than a loss of control over the conductÃ¢  it means morbid propensityÃ¢  moral irregularity is the result of that diseaseÃ¢  i suppose in some instances there areother indications of the diseaseÃ¢  i do not know that there are notÃ¢  i should think it most likely there would be  if the individual was sufficiently watchedÃ¢  that is a fair conjecture  but the case not coming under my own observation  it is impossible i can give an answerÃ¢  i have had cases under my observation  in which i suppose this form of insanity existed  one case in particular  that person was in perfect healthÃ¢  i do not think i ever met with a case where the only apparent symptom was moral irregularity  where i had no medical indication of physical diseaseÃ¢  i think that  committing a crime without any apparent motive  is an indication of insanityÃ¢  doing any thing of any sort  without any motive  is not an indication of unsoundness of mind in every instance mr  sidney taylor  q  do you not make a difference when a man has to suffer the penalty of death for the act  a  certainlyÃ¢  the species of insanity which dr  le mark calls lesion of the will is a well recognised species of insanity court  q  do you conceive that this is realty a medical question at all which has been put to you  a  i doÃ¢  i think medical men have more means of forming an opinion on that subject than other personsÃ¢  i am supported in that opinion by writers on the subject  by lours  and by le mark  who i have alluded to  who is a particularly eminent writerÃ¢  my reason for thinking so is  because it is so stated by those writers q  why could not any person form an opinion whether a person was sane or insane from the circumstances which have been referred to  a  because it seems to require a careful comparison of particular cases  more likely to be looked to by medical men  who are especially experienced in cases of unsoundness of mind q  what it the limit of responsibility a medical man would draw  a  that is a very difficult pointÃ¢  it is scarcely a medical questionÃ¢  i should not be able to draw the line where soundness ends and unsoundness beginsÃ¢  it is very difficult to draw the line between eccentricity and insanity john conolly  esq   m d  i am physician to the hanwell lunatic asylum  i have 850 patients under my careÃ¢  i have had some experience in the treatment of disorders of the mindÃ¢  i have seen and conversed with the prisonerÃ¢  in my opinion he is of unsound mind cross examined bymr  attorney general  q  when did you see him  a  the day before yesterday  for the first timeÃ¢  i saw him on that occasion  and i have been in court the whole of yesterday and this morningÃ¢  i never saw him in private more than onceÃ¢  that interview lasted perhaps half an hourÃ¢  a person who is unsound need not  in all cases  be under the care of some personÃ¢  it depends on the character of the insanityÃ¢  there may be individuals who may be at large  and associate with others  and still be of unsound mind q  do you consider there is any danger in the unsoundness you have discovered in the prisoner  a  certainly i doÃ¢  dr  chowne  mr  clark  and a gentleman who i am informed is mr  maule  the solicitor of the treasury  were with me when i examined himÃ¢  he did not exhibit any violenceÃ¢  he replied willingly to the questions i put to him  but his answers were very unsatisfactoryÃ¢  he seemed to have a very indistinct impression of the circumstancesÃ¢  he knew he was to be triedÃ¢  when i spoke to him of his trial  wishing to see what impression it made upon him  on two occasions he said   what trial  when   and subsequentlyhe seemed to know the trial was about to take place the next day  and what it wasÃ¢  i asked him if he was not conscious that he had committed a great offence in shooting at such a young and interesting person as the queenÃ¢  he said   oh  i might as well shoot at her as any body else Ã¢  i did not take notes of the conversationÃ¢  it was so short an interview  and so few questions were put  it seemed to me unnecessaryÃ¢  i went there with the view of being a witness on the trial if required q  tell me any answer that was unsatisfactory  a  without recollecting the whole conversation  i cannot pretend to do soÃ¢  i am unable to recollectÃ¢  when i asked him if he was not attached to his mother and relatives  and whether he did not think it would very much distress them that he should be brought to trial  and condemned  his reply was   yes   he was attached to themÃ¢  when i asked whether he thought it would affect them or distress them  he said he did not knowÃ¢  when i said he might possibly be condemned  he said he did not knowÃ¢  he answered indifferentlyÃ¢  i do not remember any other question  the answer to which was unsatisfactory  not so distinctly as to take on myself to repeat it q  how long before had you notice that you were going to see oxford with a view to ascertain his state of mind  a  on the evening beforeÃ¢  i made some notes when i got home of my observation of him  of the general result of the impressions of my mind  not of the questions i put or the answers i receivedÃ¢  i did not ask him to do me a sum in arithmetic mr  bdkin  q  are these the notes you refer to   producing them  a  yesÃ¢  they were not made on the same dayÃ¢  i examined the prisoner s headÃ¢  it appeared to me that the formation of the anterior part of the head would indicate an imperfect development of a certain portion of the brainÃ¢  i frequently find that form of head in insane personsÃ¢  there are many persons of that form of head who are not insaneÃ¢  my notes were written as soon afterwards as i could possibly write themÃ¢  they are very briefÃ¢  they were not made with any intention of being read Ã¢   reads  Ã¢   a deficient understanding  shape of the anterior part of the head  that which is generally seen when there has been some disease of the brain in the early period of lifeÃ¢  an occasional appearance of acuteness  but a total inability to reasonÃ¢  a singular insensibility as regards the affectionsÃ¢  an apparent incapacity to comprehend moral obligations  to distinguish right from wrongÃ¢  an absolute insensibility to the heinousness of his offence  and to the peril of his situationÃ¢  a total indifference to the issue of the trial  acquittal will give him no particular pleasure  and he seems unable to comprehend the alternative of his condemnation and execution  his offence  like that of other imbeciles who set fire to buildings   c  without motive  except a vague pleasure in mischiefÃ¢  appears unable to conceive any thing of future responsibility  court  q  of course in that conversation you had with him you were watching his manner as well as what he said  a  certainlyÃ¢  my judgment is formed in part by his manner  as well as by what he said q  did you try to ascertain whether he was acting a part with you or not  a  i tried to ascertain it as well as i possibly couldÃ¢  my judgment is formed upon all the circumstances together dr  chowne  i am a physician of charing cross hospital  i have been a physician twelve or thirteen yearsÃ¢  i am lecturer in that hospital on medical jurisprudence q  if you heard of a person committing a crime without the ordinary inducements to crime  either revenge or interest  and that crime exposes him to loss of life  and he seems reckless of consequences  and delivers himself into the hands of justice  and appears wholly exempt from any thing like consciousness of responsibility for the act  what opinion should you form of that state of mind  a  i should consider it an exceedingly strong indication of his being in an unsound state of mindÃ¢  a propensity to commit acts without an apparent or adequate motive under such circumstances is recognized as a particular species of insanity  called in medical jurisprudence  lesion of the willÃ¢  i do not know a better termÃ¢  it is an old termÃ¢  it has been called moral insanity  may i be allowed to give you an example  it is by no means an uncommon thing for me to have patients who complain to me that they are impelled with a strong disposition to commit suicide  of the madness of which act there can be no doubt  and yet there is no one symptom about those people indicating mental disease  there may be a slight degree of general indisposition  but no symptoms at all of any mental irregularity  these patients will say   i have nothing to complain of  i have no unhappy news  i have no disappointment  i have no unsatisfied wish  my husband  if the case be so  is kind to me  i have nothing at all to impel me to the act but a strong impulse Ã¢  i have been asked to prescribe for such cases  not in one sex only  but both in men and women q  now  in that sort of mental disease  is it quite consistent with the person performing the functions of life and the duties of life with accuracy  a  there is no doubt of it  they can perform the duties of life with accuracy  i do not say with the same facilityÃ¢  i saw the prisoner in newgate the day before yesterday  by permission of the secretary of state  in company with dr  conolly  mr  clark  and mr  mauleÃ¢  i had some conversation with him q  now  from the conversation you had with him  and the opportunity you had of observing him  what is your opinion as to the state of his mind  a  i should consider his state of mind is essentially unsound  there seems a mixture of insanity with imbecilityÃ¢  i regard the incapacity of controlling laughing and crying  as proofs of imbecility  not as positive proofs in themselves  but as assisting to form my opinion cross examined bymr  solicitor general  q  this propensity to suicide in the patients you speak of  were they persons performing all the duties of social life  a  they were persons proceeding with their duties of life  and in all their ordinary avocationsÃ¢  despondency of mind is very often connected with disorders of the stomach  but it very often happens that the physical cause has not been obvious  and has not developed itself at all  it is not at all necessary that the physical cause should be obviousÃ¢  in such cases  i prescribed for disease in the stomach  i found those remedies did operate on the mindÃ¢  laughing and crying without control is connected with hysteria  and also with imbecilityÃ¢  generally  when connected with hysteria  it is associated with the sensations  there must be fainting and globus hystericus  which arises in the throatÃ¢  the questions put to the prisoner were not numerous  some were put by one gentleman  and some by another  i endeavoured to impress upon him that he was labouring under error when he considered it was incapable of being proved there were balls in the pistols  i assured him  in a manner i thought most likely to make him believe  there really were that the fact of there being balls in the pistols would be proved against him  that his responsibility was a terrible one  and in all likelihood it would end in capital punishment  and if he knew whether that was decapitationÃ¢  he said he had been decapitated in fact a week before  for he had a cast taken of his headÃ¢  i endeavoured to make him understand it would be proved that there were balls in the pistolsÃ¢  i knew he had the impression that it could not be proved  from questions asked by myselfÃ¢  i cannot tell what he had said to induce me to form that opinion  but something was said to that effect by himÃ¢  i concluded  from something he said  that he entertained that opinionÃ¢  he insisted that there were no balls thereÃ¢  the fact did not occur to me beforeÃ¢  i do not remember his words  but the remark was to the effect that it was impossibleÃ¢  the question as to whether he was not concerned about his mother he treated with indifference  and seemed to be totally destitute of feeling  apprehension  or thought on the subjectÃ¢  during the whole time i was struck with a very peculiar mannerÃ¢  he was not an instant  though i believe it is partly habit  that he was not playing with a pencil and a piece of indian rubber  with which i found him drawingÃ¢  when we went into the room he was quietly drawing  with a pencil on a piece of paper  something like a landscapeÃ¢  during the whole conversation he was leaning with his head on one hand  with the other flapping about with a piece of indian rubber  sometimes clapping one pencil against another  in fact  a manner entirely without acute feeling or acute consciousness  and in order to ascertain how fax what i would call dullness of manner  that peculiar manner  might indicate idiotcy even  i desired him to get up and walk  and if i had supposed that he was acting when he was clapping the indian rubber about  that idea would entirely have been done away with by the manner in which he walked across the room  which he did with a great deal of lightness  liveliness  briskness  and smartness  not at all as if endeavouring to put on a peculiar mannerÃ¢  it occurred to me that it was perfectly natural  not as if he was acting or making the least pretenceÃ¢  the interview lasted  perhaps  about three quarters of an hourÃ¢  i did not make any note of the conversation  neither at the time or after court  q  would it not have been wise to note the time of going and coming away  a  perhaps it would  but i did not use that precautionÃ¢  mr  maule was present during part of the examination  not during the wholeÃ¢  he came in during the latter partÃ¢  i was in court all yesterday q  did you form any opinion at all from the prisoner s manner during the trial  a  i didÃ¢  i considered that manner was a continuation of the same kind of manner  but under some restraint hereÃ¢  i have no observation to make as to the form of the headÃ¢  i also subjected the prisoner to what is called the arithmetical testÃ¢  i infer nothing from itÃ¢  i merely mention it because it did occurÃ¢  he was pretty ready in casting up  but not ready in subtractionÃ¢  i am not quite certain whether at the moment he was giving his attention to it  indeed i consider it is a fallacious test james fernandee clarke  i am a practising surgeon  and have been so between three and four years  i am surgeon to the dorcas charity  and honorary secretary to the westminster medical societyÃ¢  i have had some experience in the treatment of insane persons  such as usually falls to the lot of the general practitioner  perhaps a little more  for having been so short a time in practiceÃ¢  i have been in the habit of attending the family of the prisonerÃ¢  i have known him nearly two yearsÃ¢  i accompanied dr  conolly and dr  chowne  in their visit to him  the day before yesterdayÃ¢  i have formed an opinion as to the state of his mind  not from that alone  but from other circumstances which i had had personal opportunity of seeing q  what is the opinion you have formed as to the state of his mind  a  that it is decidedly that of imbecilityÃ¢  i consider it more imbecility than any thingÃ¢  i do not like giving definitionsÃ¢  in my judgment he is decidedly of unsound mindÃ¢  during the time i have been attending his mother and sister occasionally i have had opportunities of seeing the prisoner  and his mother has frequently mentioned to me that she thought there was something exceedingly peculiar about him  and asked what i thoughtÃ¢  the chief thing that struck me was the laughing  which has been so much dwelt upon  the involuntary kind of laughingÃ¢  with what perhaps we might call a kind of general hysterical tendency in himÃ¢  he did not seem to me to have that sufficient control over the emotions which we generally find in sane individuals q  did you notice  at any time  any other symptom that is usually connected with hysteria  a  my interviews with him were not prolonged  and my attention was attracted to him chiefly by the desire of his mother  who said she was afraid he was getting in the way that his father wasÃ¢  i did not know his fatherÃ¢  i put one or two questions to him  when i saw him in newgateÃ¢  i heard questions put by the other medical men as well  and the answers which he gaveÃ¢  i watched his manner during the interview q  did it appear to you to correspond with his manner on former occasions on which you had seen him  or to differ  a  much the tame characterÃ¢  great insensibility to all the impressions which were attempted to be made upon himÃ¢  on one occasion some time ago my attention was more particularly directed to him  from a circumstance which this occurrence has brought very strongly to my recollection  i think it is about five months since i was on a visit at his mother s house  i called in my rounds to see her  she was very poorly at the time  if i recollect right  he was sitting at the fire reading a book  he took no notice of me when i entered  and seemed to be absorbed in what he was reading  his mother made some observation to him  such as   how rude you are    why not take notice of mr  clarke    why sit there and behave in this kind of way   he did not seem to notice the observation of his mother at all  he seemed still to be absorbed in the book  she put the question to him again  and there was still the same apparent reverie  and when she touched him  to put him in mind that some one was there  he jumped up in a fury  such as at the moment alarmed me  and swore that he would  stick her   i think was the expression he made use of  but certainly it was such an expression that at the moment i drew back  thinking he meditated some violence  after this transaction bad occurred  the mother called on me in great trouble  and made a communication to me  upon which i wished to see the prisoner  accompanying that with some opinion of my own  which i had formed  i did not see the prisoner until the day before yesterday  when the permission of the secretary of state was obtainedÃ¢  i had made application at the home office on the monday q  in cases of hereditary insanity  is there any particular period of life at which medical writers consider it likely to break out  to appear  a  in that kind of insanity particularly  which is connected with acts of violence escoreaux says  in several cases which bear great analogy to the one which we might suppose to exist at presentÃ¢  in six of those cases i think that three of them took place at the age of puberty  between the ages perhaps of fourteen and twenty cross examined bymr  sir frederickk pollock  q  you say you have attended the family for some time  a  yesÃ¢  i live in princes street  leicester squareÃ¢  that is perhaps a mile and a half from where mrs  oxford and the prisoner lived  but they did not live there during the whole time i attended themÃ¢  mrs  oxford has lived in commercial road within the last monthÃ¢  i never prescribed for the prisonerÃ¢  i did not recommend any course of treatmentÃ¢  i considered that the disease was mental  one of those weak minds which  under little excitement  might become overthrownÃ¢  i did not alarm the mother  for she is an exceedingly nervous womanÃ¢  i recommended no course of conduct  diet  or treatment whatever q  in short  i am to understand that you never gave any advice on the subject  of any kind whatever to his mother  a  simply in conversation  i gave my opinion rather as to his state than any advice  nothing furtherÃ¢  i never gave any advice  i was never asked my advice q  where did you meet the medical gentlemen when they went to new gate  a  we came together from dr  chowne s  i think  but i forget at this momentÃ¢  we assembled somewhere  and went togetherÃ¢  i communicated with the medical gentlemen before they saw the prisoner  and stated what my notion was about him  to assist them in their investigationÃ¢  i was present when he was brought into this court last sessions  and heard some affidavits read to postpone the trialÃ¢  i was not asked to make any affidavit at that timeÃ¢  i was subpoenaed here  and was actually in court mr  bodkin  q  was you asked to prescribe for him by his mother  a  no  my visits were to her and to the sisterÃ¢  i am not aware of any medical treatment likely to be useful in cases of hereditary insanityÃ¢  i was told he lived a regular life  no intemperance  no late hoursÃ¢  perhaps twelve o clockÃ¢  his bodily health

had nothing on but a shirtÃ¢  i did not observe whether it was a night shirt or day shirtÃ¢  his legs were not tiedÃ¢  there was a chest of drawers in the sitting roomÃ¢  the two top drawers had been

about six inches by ten or elevenÃ¢  there was nothing in itÃ¢  in the bed room mr  roe  the surgeon  picked up a tooth off the pillow  and one off the chair  and i myself picked one up off the

you don t know who the men wereÃ¢  what is their beat  how far does it go  a  it is called the liverpool road beatÃ¢  it belongs to that beatÃ¢  i came on at nine o clock that morning  and was going off at two o clockÃ¢  i was at highburyÃ¢  i do not know how near the policeman in the liverpool road beat would have to go to the place where this happenedÃ¢  i heard him say he passed the cottage about ten o clock  and heard nothing thenÃ¢  i examined the deceased s wristsÃ¢  i did not observe them when the cord was taken offÃ¢  i cannot tell whether the cord was put on after or before he was deadÃ¢  he was bruised about the knees  and on the breastÃ¢  the pillow case was all over bloodÃ¢  it appeared that a blow had been given him while he was lying there  by the tooth being on the pillow mary thorntonre examined  q  to whom did you first give any information concerning the state in which you found the cottage  a  to my son s landlady  a person named pershouse  in the next cottage to ours  about three minutes after i first found it outÃ¢  my son returned from thetheatre about ten or twenty minutes after nine o clock in the morningÃ¢  i had heard mr  templeman mention that he had a grandson living in mortimer street  and i knew him wellÃ¢  as soon as my son came home from the theatre  i sent him to give information to mr  templemanÃ¢  that was in consequence of what the deceased had told me during his life time cross examined  q  did you see mr  templeman s body through the window  a  i didÃ¢  i said so to mrs  pershouseÃ¢  she did not accompany me to the window  and i told the baker  who came up with mr  templeman s breadÃ¢  i do not know the policeman who was on duty at the timeÃ¢  i never saw himÃ¢  i have seen policemen there  but do not know who was there that morningÃ¢  they very seldom came thereÃ¢  i did not attempt to find one edward roe  i am a surgeon  and live in brown buildings  islington  i accompanied mr  lord and a policeman to mr  templeman s cottage  about twenty minutes after eleven o clockÃ¢  the policeman got through the window  opened the door  and let us inÃ¢  i saw the deceased with only a shirt on  lying with his feet towards the fire place  and his head towards the door of the roomÃ¢  the body was in the bed room  towards the door  which is between the two roomsÃ¢  he was lying on his back  rather inclining to the left side  lacing the windowÃ¢  his eyes were firmly bandaged with a stockingÃ¢  if he had been alive  he could not have seenÃ¢  there was a good deal of blood on the stocking  which i think must have been saturated with the blood on the floor  after it was tied on his eyesÃ¢  i have no doubt his head had fallen on the floor  and the stocking got into the bloodÃ¢  his hands were securely tied by a cord in this postureÃ¢   describing it Ã¢  a small cord secured the other cord fastened between the wrists  through a noose in the cord  to make it more secureÃ¢  i did not notice the wrists thenÃ¢  i did after the cord was removed  and they were galled  and the hands and nails blueÃ¢  that would unquestionably show that it had been put on during lifeÃ¢  i have no doubt he struggledÃ¢  the blueness would be occasioned by the pressure of the cordÃ¢  i observed several bruises on his face  a severe blow over the left temple  and a cut on the noseÃ¢  the lower jaw was fractured on both sidesÃ¢  i observed four clean cuts on the back of the head  and one or two bruises on the breast bone  in conjunction with the collar boneÃ¢  his knees were much abraised  rubbed up  as he had  no doubt  been struggling on the floorÃ¢  there was some blood on the floor immediately under the deceased s headÃ¢  i should say perhaps ten ouncesÃ¢  the wounds would most likely continue to bleed some timeÃ¢  there was no contused wound on the left temple to cause the bloodÃ¢  i have no doubt a good deal of the blood came from the jaw  and also the clean cuts on the back of the headÃ¢  the blow on the temple was most probably given by a blunt round instrument  similar to a policeman s staffÃ¢  it might be done by a piece of woodÃ¢  the same instrument might have produced the fracture of the jaw  and one blow might produce both fracturesÃ¢  i think the wound on the nose was from a kick  or something of that description  not done by a sharp instrumentÃ¢  the wounds on the back of the head were inflicted by a very sharp instrument court  q  were they inflicted as with a knife  as if a person had cut  or a hatchet  as if they had struck  a  neitherÃ¢  i should say like a chisel  as if a chisel had been struck on the back of the head mr  jones  q  did you find any teeth  a  i found one on the pillow  with a great deal of blood round it  and another on a chair  with a few spots of bloodÃ¢  i was present when a third was found by the policemanÃ¢  i examined the jaw  and found three teeth had been forced from the socketsÃ¢  they were not front  but tide teethÃ¢  i think that was very probably done by the blow which produced the fracturesÃ¢  there were several blows about the mouth  and i think one while he was lying in bed  from the circumstance of the tooth being found on the pillow  and the blood thereÃ¢  the tooth on the chair was as if it had fallen out when he got out of bedÃ¢  i found a small piece of stick  about two inches and a half or three inches long  with hair attached to it  and saturated with bloodÃ¢  it was the hair of the headÃ¢  it was dark hairÃ¢  i can scarcely call it greyÃ¢  this is the piece of splinterÃ¢   produced Ã¢  there is hair on it nowÃ¢  a kick from the heel or toe of a shoe might have made the cut on the nose  if there were nails in it  and i think it might be done by a shoe or boot without nailsÃ¢  from the appearance of the body when i saw it  i should judge it had been dead fire or six hoursÃ¢  it retained a little warmth about the region of the heartÃ¢  the body was quite coldÃ¢  the time in which a body gets cold depends occasionally on the kind of death the person meets withÃ¢  a body has retained warmth occasionally two days after deathÃ¢  ten or eleven hours is not at all an unusual timeÃ¢  i have no doubt  had the body remained in bed  it would have been warm a long time after it wasÃ¢  mr  lord accompanied meÃ¢  he was also present at the post mortem examinationÃ¢  the injuries which i saw on the body  produced deathÃ¢  i have no doubt the death was owing to the violence i have described court  q  how was the stocking fastened round the head  a  it was tied in a knot twiceÃ¢  the knot was formed in the stocking itselfÃ¢  the blow on the temple was above the stocking  over the temple cross examined  q  is it your judgment  as a man of experience  that the body had been dead about five or six hours  a  it isÃ¢  i should rather say a body would be more likely to retain heat two days where the party came to his death by violent meansÃ¢  a body would of course be more likely to get cold on the floor than in bedÃ¢  it was a very cold night on monday  and morning tooÃ¢  i should think there was not sixteen ounces of blood altogether on the pillow and floor q  i believe the piece of stick is mahogany  a  i am no judgeÃ¢  it is saturated with blood  and the character of the wood is alteredÃ¢  it is splintered off a round stickÃ¢  there is no doubt of it mr  jones  q  in your judgment  would the blows you saw on the deceased occasion instant death  a  i believe the blow over the left temple would occasion instant deathÃ¢  i did not observe whether there was any matting or carpet on the floorÃ¢  he might have been dead more than five or six hoursÃ¢  it is mere matter of opinionÃ¢  saw nothing to render it improbable that he had been dead a longer time court  q  it may have been fifteen  ten  or five or six  but it must have been five or six  that is what you mean  a  yes  it could not have been less than five or sixÃ¢  i do not know whether it might have been fifteen  it is a very difficult question to answerÃ¢  i should rather not pledge myself to a few hours  more or less alfred lord  i am a surgeon  and live in trinidad place  islington  i was present at mr  templeman s cottage with mr  roe  and saw the state in which the body wasÃ¢  i attended the post mortem examinationÃ¢  in my judgment he died of the wounds i sawÃ¢  the blow on the left temple would alone be sufficient to produce deathÃ¢  it produced concussion of the brain  and extravasation of bloodÃ¢  he would not be able to stir after that the same blow producing a fracture of the skull  he could not struggle afterwardsÃ¢  the struggling with the arms and knees must have been beforeÃ¢  after the blow which fractured the jaw there might have been a good deal of struggling court  q  did the deceased appear to be an athletic strong man  a  he appeared to have been so at one period of life  and from my observation of his body he was rather a stout manÃ¢  he appeared rather a strongish man  and one who would struggle a good deal  i thinkÃ¢  the hands were blue below the cordÃ¢  the hands and nailsÃ¢  i do not think one man could have tied his hands unless another held them john collins  police sergeant   i went to mr  templeman s cottage on  tuesday morning  and was there with the surgeonsÃ¢  i have produced the splinter of woodÃ¢  it was cut at the police officeÃ¢  i have had it examined  according to the prisoner s request  by a turner  who gave his opinion that it is  red saunders Ã¢  he described it as a very heavy close wood  coming from new south walesÃ¢  i searched the drawers in the deceased s sitting roomÃ¢  the top drawer on the left hand side had been broken open apparently by a chisel or small crow bar or somethingÃ¢  i found in it two boxes  a quantity of papers  and two notes of the bank of eleganceÃ¢  one for 50l  and the other for 5l Ã¢   producing them Ã¢  this is the mahogany boxÃ¢  it has a lock to itÃ¢  it is not brokenÃ¢  it was shut when i found it  but unlockedÃ¢  i found the key of it in the deceased s trowsers pocketÃ¢  i do not think any violence had been offered to the lockÃ¢  there are also a quantity of papers  bills  and memorandumsÃ¢  i found no money in the drawers  but in his trowsers pocket was a purse with three sixpencesÃ¢  that was in the same pocket with the keyÃ¢  the papers were apparently tumbled about a good dealÃ¢  these notes  folded up in this way look like notes of the bank of englandÃ¢  i thought they were so when i first found themÃ¢  behind the door of the sitting room i found a chopper and a hammer in the corner between the outer door and the bed room doorÃ¢  i do not think they had been usedÃ¢  i also found a hammer in the cupboard on the top of some clothesÃ¢  that did not appear to have been usedÃ¢  i found no piece of wood except thisÃ¢  i found no weight except two clock weightsÃ¢  they were round at the bottom and flat at the topÃ¢  they were in the further corner of the sitting room  attached to the clockÃ¢  i did not find any other weights in the bed room cross examined  q  how many persons have you taken up on this charge  a  there have been four persons  jarvis and his wife  ciprani

about three yearsÃ¢  he appeared generally poorly in the winter  he had better health in the summerÃ¢  he appeared rather poorly that dayÃ¢  he had acold  i imagineÃ¢  i paid him 3l  that morningÃ¢  it consisted of five or six half crownsÃ¢  i am positive there were five  and one half sovereign  the rest in shillings  and to the best of my knowledge six sixpences cross examined  q  do you know where you got that money  a  i took it in business at different timesÃ¢  i took the whole of it within two days in our shop hannah morgan  i live at no  18  skinner street  somer s townÃ¢  i knew the deceasedÃ¢  he called on me on the 16th of march at half past eleven o clock in the morning  and asked me to lend him 3l   which i didÃ¢  i gave him fourteen half crowns and twenty five shillingsÃ¢

bad cold court  q  did he give you any reason why he borrowed the money  a  he said he wanted it to make up an account of moneyÃ¢  he left at a quarter before twelve o clock  and came in again and dined with us afterwards mr  jones  q  did he ask you to lend him the 3l  before he went away  or afterwards  a  he asked for it as soon as he returned to dine  which was about a quarter before twelve  or from that to twelveÃ¢  i do not live near himÃ¢  he left at half past three o clock in the afternoonÃ¢  skinner street leads into the new road  nearly opposite judd streetÃ¢  i cannot tell how far that is from pocock s fieldsÃ¢  i never was there  only at the barnsbury castle public houseÃ¢  i suppose it is two miles from thereÃ¢  i know mrs  lovettÃ¢  she lives about three doors from meÃ¢  he gave me the shilling after he asked for the 3l jane lovettre examined  i did not observe whether he had any other money about him when i paid him the 3l  for the rent cross examined  q  where did he

subpoenaed to attend here  a  last nightÃ¢  that was the first time i was applied to court  q  did your dog make any noise on the night of the 16th  a  noÃ¢  the dog was about as far from the window at which the persons got into the house  as across this court  or half as far againÃ¢  i am sure the dog would begin to bark at a stranger at that distance  if he could hear his footsteps  but it would be ten to one if the dog heard them  because that window is in front  and the dog was behind henry wright  i am potman at the duchess of kent public house  devereux street  dover road  where i have been seven weeksÃ¢  it is about four miles from mr  templeman s cottageÃ¢  i have known the prisoner from seven to eight monthsÃ¢  i saw him on the 12th or 13th of last march  i am not positive

money  and for want of money he was getting worseÃ¢  he stated that he knew an old man who had got moneyÃ¢  i asked him how he knew he had got moneyÃ¢  he said he had heard he had bid 25l  for a cottage  and he had flashed a 50l  note  and said if that was not enough he had got moreÃ¢  the prisoner said that he had put the notes into a drawer  and it would be like a gift to him  for he knew where to put his hand on itÃ¢  he said he should like to have a right one along with himÃ¢  i said   a right one  Ã¢  he said   yes  a right one  or i could do it myself Ã¢  i asked him where the old

robbery was intended  a  yesÃ¢  i understood his intent was to commit a robberyÃ¢  it was mentioned only in my bearingÃ¢  i did not suppose any violence was to be done to the old gentlemanÃ¢  i understood him to mean by  a right one   somebody to assist him  that he could depend uponÃ¢  i understood there was to be a robbery only q  were you shocked at it  a  why  i took very little notice of itÃ¢  i named it to squires when i went round at nine o clock  and said i did not know whether it was intended or notÃ¢  squires lives at the two brewers public house  the next houseÃ¢  i did not name it to any policemanÃ¢  squires said he did not think if he had any intention he would have named itÃ¢  squires is not here q  did you think it was a joke  a  i did not think he was jokingÃ¢  i took no notice of what he said  till i named it to squires at nine o clock  and neither of us took notice of itÃ¢  it never entered my mind till i readÃ¢  till i heard of the murder  q  why name it to squires if you thought nothing about it  and if you did think any thing about it why did you not name it to a policeman  a  i named it to squires  and it did not enter my mind afterwards till squires told me he had read in the paper of a murder  and i read of it when i got homeÃ¢  i first heard of it on the wednesdayÃ¢  squires had read the paper  and named it to meÃ¢  i do not know james rogers

the communication to meÃ¢  i went before the magistrate on the saturdayÃ¢  one of the officers called on meÃ¢  that was after i had made the communication to allenÃ¢  i stated at the office all of the circumstances as near as i could recollectÃ¢  i never had any quarrel with the prisonerÃ¢  i had always been on friendly terms with himÃ¢  squires is living at this place nowÃ¢   a messenger was here sent to fetch squires  john richard johnson  i live at no  7  dotset street  spitalfields  and am a print colourerÃ¢  i colour caricatures  and principally religious printsÃ¢  that is the way in which i get my livingÃ¢  i have known the prisoner between four and five yearsÃ¢  i saw him on friday evening the 13th of marchÃ¢  i left off work about half past seven o clock that evening  and when i came down stairs there was a person in the passage inquiring for jemÃ¢  i did not see himÃ¢  i heard him  and when i came down in the passage the woman below said jem was not at home  and then i saw the prisoner  arthur nicholson Ã¢  that was the name he gave meÃ¢   a private in the 11th light dragoons  canterbury Ã¢  the prisoner was present when i wrote this paper i have in my handÃ¢  that if ever he should be tried as a deserter  i might know his right nameÃ¢  he gave me this  as near as possible  twelve months ago last decemberÃ¢  he desired me to write down his name that i might know if he was ever tried as a deserter  he was the manÃ¢  it is my handwritingÃ¢  he saw me write itÃ¢  i put it into the drawer  and there it remained till this occurrence took placeÃ¢  when i saw him in the passage  i said   dick  how do you get on  Ã¢  he said he wanted to see jemÃ¢  i asked him what he wanted to see jem forÃ¢  he said he wanted to see him  for he wanted to borrow a screwÃ¢  i asked him what forÃ¢  he said he was going to serve an old gentleman in a lonely cottageÃ¢  i told him he had better not do any thing of the kind  if he did he would be sure to get transportedÃ¢  he told me he might as well be transported for that  for if he was takes as a deserter  he was sure to be transportedÃ¢  at the end of that conversation  a fight took place at the bottom of our street  and i and the prisoner went down together to see itÃ¢  seven or eight rounds were foughtÃ¢  the police came up to disperse the mob  and i and the prisoner returned back again about as far as our door  and i wished him good nightÃ¢  he said   you had better not go yet  for i want to see jem very particularly Ã¢  i asked him what he wanted to see jem so very particularly forÃ¢  he said he wanted a darkey  that he had left there some time ago  and it might be handyÃ¢  i told him if he wanted to see jem so very particularly  he had better go over the way to the public houseÃ¢  he said he could not go over the way  for he had no moneyÃ¢  he further stated  that if he served the old gentleman  as was his intention on the saturday  he was going over the water to see his aunt or cousin  and would give me a call on sunday  and let me know q  let you know what  a  whether he had robbed the old gentleman  i supposeÃ¢  that is the inference i drew from what he saidÃ¢  he did not say he would rob himÃ¢  he said he would call on sunday and let me know q  you have said he spoke about a screw and a darkey  what is meantby a screw  a  i cannot tell  only from what i have been in the habit of readingÃ¢  i have read  bell s life in london Ã¢  i know what screw means according to the defamation i have heard in the bookÃ¢  according to the defamation i have read in  bell s life in london   it means a picklock keyÃ¢  i bid the prisoner good night  and we partedÃ¢  i saw no more of himÃ¢  i afterwards saw an account of the murder at islington in the newspaper  and the day after i gave information to a policeman of the h divisionÃ¢  that division is in the neighbourhood of spitalfieldsÃ¢  i then stated what i have to day  i believe  word for wordÃ¢  i was examined before the magistrate  after recognising the prisonerÃ¢  i was taken by a policeman to be sure of himÃ¢  waddingtoo the jailer said   you are to recognise the prisoner Ã¢  i believe i said  yes   and i pointed to him  and said   that is the man  cross examined  q  how long have you known gould  a  between four and five yearsÃ¢  that was as near as possible my first acquaintance with himÃ¢  i only knew him then as dick or richard  nothing furtherÃ¢  that was at mr  webber s  at the public house at the corner of our streetÃ¢  i never inquired his other nameÃ¢  i should say i knew him three years as dick q  where was be living when he got you to write this card  a  why  i gave him a lodging  to tell you the truth  at now 7  dorset streetÃ¢  i have not known him up to the present timeÃ¢  he has been absent some timeÃ¢

labouring manÃ¢  he has only a small apartment at 1s  3d  a weekÃ¢  he gets his living among the wharfs  on board the barges  to carry flour or corn  or any thing on shore if barges come up  and if they wanted any body to unload them  they would as life employ him as any bodyÃ¢  he may have regular masters for any thing i knowÃ¢  i do not know that he has q  what has he been during the fourteen or fifteen years you have known him  a  he got his living by going about buying and repairing old umbrellas  portering  or any thing like thatÃ¢  i do not know whether he comes in at good hours at nightÃ¢  he never lived in the same house as me beforeÃ¢  i had no objection to having him in the same house  but i have not the letting of the house q  why should you object to let him the house if you had the letting of it  a  because he is a man so often out of work  and could not afford to pay his rentÃ¢  i have been in business about twenty four or twenty five years  not always colouring religious prints  but latterly i have done themÃ¢  i have done some thousands of prints for mr  fairburn  no  110  minories  principally religious printsÃ¢  i have occasionally done maps  plans  and

knowledgeÃ¢  i bought this coat the other day  and i might sell it to morrowÃ¢  i bought every thing i have got on court  q  do not answer in that foolish wayÃ¢  did you ever buy and sell to make profit  a  never mr  chambers  q  you never bought anything  a  no  it was never said that i didÃ¢  i was never charged with buying any thingÃ¢  i was never in any scrape about a robbery  i am certainÃ¢  i will tell you  the prisoner and i were together at a public house  a man charged me with robbing him of a shilling  and the prisoner went with me to the station house  and offered the man 5s  to let me outÃ¢  i was not let outÃ¢  the man came between one and two o clock in the morning  said he had found the shilling  and wanted the man to discharge me  but he said he could not  as the charge for felony was signedÃ¢  the man never appeared afterwardsÃ¢  it happened at the bluecoat boy public house  in dorset street  within a door or two of my own houseÃ¢  the man was a butcherÃ¢  i have known him in the neighbourhood for yearsÃ¢  that is not quite two years ago  i thinkÃ¢  i was once locked up for being drunk and disorderlyÃ¢  i have never been in any difficulty about other people s property  except about the shilling q  when the prisoner said he was going to commit a robbery  did you endeavour to persuade him not to do so  a  i said if he did he would be sure to be transportedÃ¢  i did not endeavour to persuade him not to do itÃ¢  i did not believe himÃ¢  i understood what he meant by a screw  by reading  tom and jerry  and  bell s life Ã¢  i have seen that expression in  tom and jerry  many timesÃ¢  i have borrowed the book once or twice q  if you thought he really meant nothing  how came you to tell him he would be transported if he did it  a  why he would if he did it q  i thought you considered he was in fun  a  i did not think he was in much funÃ¢  i did not think he was in earnestÃ¢  he has laughed and joked with me many times before q  did you really think him in fun or earnest  a  i should firmly believe now that he did mean it  but i did not believe he meant it at the momentÃ¢  i should sooner say he was in joke than in earnest q  why persuade him not to do it  then  and tell him he would be transported  a  i said if he did it he would be transported q  now  while you were pausing to give me an answer  did not you hear what that gentleman  mr  ballantine  saidÃ¢  did you not give me your answer after hearing what that gentleman said  a  i did not hear what he said  i did not hear him speakÃ¢  i could see his lips go  that is allÃ¢  i did not shake hands with the prisoner when i parted with himÃ¢  i have shook hands with him many timesÃ¢  i did not see jem that night  nor tell him he was wantedÃ¢  i left the prisoner at the door when i bid him good nightÃ¢  i did not go up to my own roomÃ¢  i came back between eleven and twelve o clock  i believeÃ¢  i do not know whether jem was at homeÃ¢  i did not see jem at all before i read any thing in the newspapersÃ¢  he was in the back room  i supposeÃ¢  we have to go down the cellar into the yard  and there is the back room thereÃ¢  i saw jem once before i read the newspaperÃ¢  i think he came home as usual mr  jones  q  had you any other reason for not liking to have jem in the house except his poverty  a  that is allÃ¢  i have never been in custody except on the occasion i have mentioned q  you have been asked whether you believed the prisoner was serious when he said he was going to commit a robbery  did you believe it at the time  a  so many jokes have passed between me and him  i did not know how to take itÃ¢  i believe it now  from what has happened court  q  what time was it he came to you  a  about twenty minutes to eight o clock  as near as possibleÃ¢  at half past seven o clock i sent my wife home with three hundred printsÃ¢  i had just got my coat and shoes on and came down  and judge it to be that timeÃ¢  he was with me altogether about a quarter of an hourÃ¢  he left me before eight o clockÃ¢  as i passed the station house to go into church street  the bells struck out eight  that was the moment i had parted with himÃ¢  i did not see jem during all the time i was with him james rogers  i live at no  7  dorset street  spitalfieldsÃ¢  i am an umbrella maker by trade  but i do not follow itÃ¢  i work at the water side as a labourerÃ¢  i have known the prisoner about five years  or it may be six  by the name of richard or dickÃ¢  on the 13th of march was the last time i saw him  barring seeing him at hatton gardenÃ¢  i saw him at my door  where i live  when i was going home between eight and nine o clock in the evening court  q  between eight and nine o clock  a  yesÃ¢  i believe i once said a quarter before eight o clockÃ¢  i now say it was between eight and nine mr  ballantine  q  where were you standing  a  i was coming home  and he was standing by the window as i was coming  just between the window and the doorÃ¢  the first observation he made to me was   jem  you are just the chap i want to see Ã¢  i said   what do you want to see me for  Ã¢  he said   i want for you to lend me two screws and a darkey Ã¢  i should say he meant skeleton keys and a dark lanternÃ¢  i said he might as well ask me for a Ã¢ 500 note as to ask me for such things as themÃ¢  nothing else was said on that subjectÃ¢  i said i had no money for beer or else i would treat him  and he said he had noneÃ¢  my brother in law was along with meÃ¢  he had not been with me all the timeÃ¢  he came up along with me when i came to the door  but i don t think he heard any thing of what he said  but i cannot say whether he did or notÃ¢  i said to my brother in law   bill  you stand a pot of beer Ã¢  he said   i have not got any money without going home to fetch it  but go over to the public house  call for a pot of beer  and i will come and pay for it Ã¢  we went to the blue coat boy public house in dorset street  and had a pot of beer  my brother in law paid for itÃ¢  i once kept an old iron shopÃ¢  that was while i was acquainted with the prisoner  and he knew it cross examined  q  where was it you kept the old iron shop  a  in little paternoster rowÃ¢  i did not keep the houseÃ¢  i had the lower part nine or ten months  then necessity compelled me to leave itÃ¢  i sold locks and any thing in that wayÃ¢  i bought and sold old iron  and sometimes bottles and rags  not any thing that came to hand  because there might be things that came in a different sort of wayÃ¢  i was very careful of what i boughtÃ¢  i used to go and collect thingsÃ¢  i mostly bought in petticoat laneÃ¢  i have never been in any scrape arising from the old iron shop  not at allÃ¢  i was never taken upÃ¢  if i were to say i never was in any prison  i should say falseÃ¢  when i was a boy i got a month for sleeping out in the open airÃ¢  that is seventeen or eighteen years agoÃ¢  i was in no business thenÃ¢  i was sent to coldbath fields for a monthÃ¢  i cannot recollect any thing elseÃ¢  i became acquainted with the expressions darkey and screws by reading  bell s life  newspaperÃ¢  i don t know whether johnson reads itÃ¢  i am sure i have seen those expressions in  bell s life Ã¢  i never read it in  tom and jerry Ã¢  i do not know that i ever took up that paperÃ¢  i have known johnson  i suppose  about ten yearsÃ¢  he lodges in the same house as me  with his wifeÃ¢  he has got three or four children i believeÃ¢  i very seldom go up into his roomÃ¢  i believe he was a print colourer when i first knew himÃ¢  i may have been up in his room two or three times q  how long before gould visited you had you seen johnson  a  i suppose not for a monthÃ¢  i go in and out of the placeÃ¢  i live down stairsÃ¢  i have not lodged there altogether  i believe  above four monthsÃ¢  i have seen johnson out of the house  but not above once in the house to my knowledgeÃ¢  my brother in law s name is william craneÃ¢  i found the prisoner standing between the window and the doorÃ¢  crane was with meÃ¢  he went home to get the money  returned and paid for the beer  and then retired to look after a sweetheart of hisÃ¢  he was standing within a yard or two till he went away to get the moneyÃ¢  the prisoner did not whisperÃ¢  he spoke loud enoughÃ¢  crane might or might not hear itÃ¢  i cannot sayÃ¢  i dare say he mightÃ¢  i had no notion what the darkey and screws were wanted forÃ¢  i never gave it a thoughtÃ¢  there had been no darkey left with meÃ¢  i did not see johnson at all that nightÃ¢  i do not think i saw him at all after  till i had been up to hatton gardenÃ¢  i am not positive of itÃ¢  he and i had no conversationÃ¢  i never kept such things as skeleton keys when i was in the iron tradeÃ¢  nothing of the kind  nor darkeysÃ¢  when i first knew the prisoner he was pot boy at a house at the bottom of the street q  did you think there was any thing wrong in asking for these  a  i did not give it a thought whether there was any thing wrong or rightÃ¢  i did not trouble my head about itÃ¢  i passed it by as a jokeÃ¢  i get my bread by the water side when i am in employÃ¢  i do not work for any body in the umbrella businessÃ¢  i work for myself  but i am an occasional man in the other jobÃ¢  i had a job on saturdayÃ¢  i sometimes go out very soon in the morning  and work from eight or ten o clock in the evening till twelve o clock  when we are landing ale  and such thingsÃ¢  i was examined at the police office mr  ballantine  q  were you compelled to go before the magistrate  or did you give evidence voluntarily  a  i saw it in the paper  and i went up to hatton garden the same day  but there was no court thenÃ¢  it was not the same day i saw the account of the murder  but the same day i saw my name in the paperÃ¢  that was on monday  and i went up the same day  but the examination was not onÃ¢  it took place the next day  and i attended and gave evidenceÃ¢  i stated all i knewÃ¢  i have been on friendly terms with the prisoner  but i have not seen him above twice for two years court  q  when you went to be examined you knew johnson had been examined  a  i was told he had been the week previous  but i did not see johnson till after i had been examinedÃ¢  i think i saw his examination in the newspaper before i was examined  but i will not be positive richard squires  i am waiter at the two brewers public house  george street  horsemonger lane  and have been so four years  i knowthe prisoner  but no more than by seeing him three times in my lifeÃ¢  i saw him last  i think  on the 17th of marchÃ¢  he came over the water to see wrightÃ¢  it was on the thursday evening  to the best of my recollectionÃ¢  i cannot swear whether it was thursday or fridayÃ¢  it was about half past eight o clock in the evening  or it might be nine o clockÃ¢  i saw him close by where wright lives  at the duchess of kent public houseÃ¢  he was not with wright at that timeÃ¢  i know wright by seeing him  and drinking with him now and thenÃ¢  we drank together that evening  me  wright  and gouldÃ¢  i left first  i believe  but the other two went away directlyÃ¢  i went home court  q  and went to bed  a  after i had done my businessÃ¢  i had to wait on the company in the tap roomÃ¢  i did nothing moreÃ¢  i saw wright again  i believe  that night  at the duchess of kent public house  where he lives mr  ballantine  q  had you any conversation with wright when you saw him again  if you did see him  a  i do not know whether it was the same evening or next morning  it might be next morning he saw me  and we might stop and ask how we got on  and he brought it up about dickÃ¢  he mentioned dick s name court  q  who came for you to day  a  i do not know his nameÃ¢  he said i was wanted hereÃ¢  he did not mention for what  to my knowledgeÃ¢  he did not tell me what i was wanted forÃ¢  he said i must come to the old bailey  or something of that sortÃ¢  he said he wanted me along with himÃ¢  he did not say what about  nothing at all q  do you mean to swear you had no idea what you were gong to be examined to before you went into that box  a  yes  i knew what it wasÃ¢  i was up at hatton garden before  but my evidence was of no useÃ¢  i was not examinedÃ¢  i stated what i knew  and it was of no use cross examined  q  you stated what you had got to say  and then you were sent away  a  yesÃ¢  i came here to day in a cab  with one of the servants  i expect  from this officeÃ¢  he found me at the two brewers public houseÃ¢  i had very little conversation with him in our wayÃ¢  i have not seen wright here to dayÃ¢  i heard him examined at hatton garden the last timeÃ¢  he and i have talked about the matter sinceÃ¢  we have sat together and talkedÃ¢  i was at hatton garden the last time he was there  on tuesday  a week agoÃ¢  i had never been there beforeÃ¢  when i went up i found gould standing near the duchess of kent public houseÃ¢  wright was not there thenÃ¢  he came up about half a minute alter i met gouldÃ¢  i cannot say what was said while we were talking together  nothing very particularÃ¢  we drank a pint of porter  or whether it was a pint or a pot  i cannot sayÃ¢  we drank it at the opposite corner to the duchess of kent  where wright livesÃ¢  i mean outside the duchess of kentÃ¢  we were about three minutes together there  it might be fourÃ¢  we did not talk muchÃ¢  we continued drinking till the pot was outÃ¢  no one paid for the beer at that timeÃ¢  we had beer out with us from my house and from the duchess of kentÃ¢  i was carrying beer outÃ¢  i cannot say whether the pot was taken out of my beer or out of wright sÃ¢  we must have paid for it when we went homeÃ¢  i paid say mistress for mineÃ¢  i cannot say how much was drankÃ¢  i cannot say whether it was a pint or a potÃ¢  i cannot swear whether it was my master s beer  or wright s master s  that we drankÃ¢  i might have paid my mistress for itÃ¢  i paid for all i brought outÃ¢  i cannot say how much i paid herÃ¢  no money was produced by any body while we were drinkingÃ¢  nothing was said about money to my knowledgeÃ¢  i believe  when i saw wright he was coming along with his porterÃ¢  i was talking with gould q  when they saw each other  did they ask each other how they did  or what was said  a  no  it appeared they had been together beforeÃ¢  wright might have said   halloo Ã¢  i do not know that he didÃ¢  i cannot recollect any thing that was saidÃ¢  it might have been half past eight or nine o clockÃ¢  i should say it was half past eight o clock  as near as i can recollect  because i was out with my porterÃ¢  i go out with it at eight o clock  and i was just going homeÃ¢  i might have some porter leftÃ¢  i generally haveÃ¢  i cannot say whether i had or not q  did you toss for any porter  a  we might have tossed  i do not recollect tossingÃ¢  we might have been a pint each  or stood a pint  either one of usÃ¢  i have no recollection whether we tossed  or whether we were a pint each  or whether one of us was a pintÃ¢  i cannot say we did not tossÃ¢  we might have tossed  and i forget itÃ¢  i immediately went in  and was waiting on the customers after thatÃ¢  i came out again that nightÃ¢  i might come out with beer after thatÃ¢  that would be at nine o clock  if it was half past eight beforeÃ¢  if it was after nine o clock i did not come outÃ¢  i do not sleep in the houseÃ¢  i sleep with my wife  in st  george s court  dover roadÃ¢  it might be twelve o clock when i went homeÃ¢  i cannot recollect when i went home that nightÃ¢  i cannot recollect who i saw when i was going home mr  ballantine  q  you were taking out beer for your mistressÃ¢  what is the method  do you account for the number of pots you take out  a  i have to pay for all the porter i take out every dayÃ¢  i never return anyÃ¢  i pay for all every nightÃ¢  the person who came to me this morning did not produce any thing  but had a cab for me to ride overÃ¢  i live 200 or 300 yards from the public house i work atÃ¢  i cannot swear whether i left that night before or after the house was closed charles allen  i live at wilson s cottage  pocock s fields  i am a boot and shoemakerÃ¢  i have seen mr  templeman s house since his death  but not beforeÃ¢  i know it nowÃ¢  i should say it is between 300 and 500 yards from where i liveÃ¢  i have known the prisoner  as near as i can tell  about twelve monthsÃ¢  he has lodged at my house several timesÃ¢  i cannot possibly state when he commenced lodging with me the last timeÃ¢  he lodged with me at least seven nights before this occurredÃ¢  i know he had very little money  if any  before the 16th of march  and i was confident  from circumstances which occurred  that he had no moneyÃ¢  when he has come home of an evening he has said he had no money  and i considered by his getting up of a morning  and not having breakfast before he went out  that he had none  for few people like to go out without food  if they have money to purchase itÃ¢  on the saturday night before this occurred he had none  because he made an observation when he came into the house that he had no money  but he should have some in the course of to morrow  which was sundayÃ¢  on the monday morning following that saturday  i think he went out between eight and nine o clockÃ¢  he had no breakfast with us before he went out that morningÃ¢  i believe he was dressed something similar to what he is now  but i cannot positively swear whether he had that coat or a jacket onÃ¢  as far as i can tell  i believe he was dressed much as he is nowÃ¢  he had on a pair of shoes  which i madeÃ¢  i did not make them for himÃ¢  they were misfits  but i sold them to himÃ¢  they were ancle shoes  similar to what i have on now  shoes the leather of which comes above the ancleÃ¢  they had nailsÃ¢  i saw gouldnailing them about a fortnight beforeÃ¢  they were then getting the worse or wear  still they were wearableÃ¢  i had seen them everyday on his feetÃ¢  at the time i saw him nailing them they were fit for wear  i am certain  and would have lasted much longer for nice fine weather than for wetÃ¢  i have no recollection whether he went out alone or in company that morningÃ¢  i have no recollection of seeing any body before he went outÃ¢  the next time i saw him was  as near as i can tell  on the tuesday morning about three o clockÃ¢  i was then lying in my own bed  and my wife likewiseÃ¢  he came into the houseÃ¢  it was very light at the time  the moon shiningÃ¢  it was the lightness of the moonÃ¢  the instant he came into the house he went into his bed room  as the door opens into the roomÃ¢  he opens his bed room door and closes the front door while he passes to his bed roomÃ¢  my wife said to him   richard  it is early   or  late   i am not sure which  and his reply was   it is early Ã¢  nothing more passedÃ¢  the next time i saw him was  i believe  between eight and nine o clock on the tuesday morningÃ¢  we have no clock to judge the time  but as near as i can tell i saw him between eight and nineÃ¢  i got up between six and sevenÃ¢  he got up between eight and nineÃ¢  i was in my sitting roomÃ¢  he came into it  passed through  and went to the wash houseÃ¢  the wash house leads to the privy and to the back yardÃ¢  he remained in the wash house  as near as i can tell  from twenty five minutes to half an hourÃ¢  when he came out of his bed room he had his coat and waistcoat on his arm  and i believe his boots in his hand  but i am not certain whether they were on his feet or in his handÃ¢  when he returned  he came through the room where i was sitting at breakfast  and went out at the front doorÃ¢  he went straight from the wash house to the front door and went outÃ¢  i observed nothing particular about him when he went outÃ¢  i believe he had on the same clothes he has nowÃ¢  he had on the same shoes as i had made him  but they were blackedÃ¢  when he was in a situation he blacked them every morning  but not at other timesÃ¢  how he got the brushes to clean them i do not know  but the brushes were in the back place when he was goneÃ¢  they were my brushes and blackingÃ¢  if he used it  it was my blacking q  can you tell whether  on this night  he used any candle or rush light to go to bed  a  i never saw richard have a candle in our house all the time he was in it  unless he asked for such a thing  and that was very seldomÃ¢  if he wanted one it was merely for a minute to get something out of the room  and he was supplied by our candle which stood on the tableÃ¢  i have not found any candle or rush light about my premises since that nightÃ¢  he returned about a quarter past seven o clock on the tuesday evening  much about that timeÃ¢  i had heard of the murder about half past ten  or near eleven o clockÃ¢  when the prisoner came home i was gone to fetch a pint of porter and a rasher of bacon for supperÃ¢  when i returned he was sitting in my room talking to my wifeÃ¢  the conversation when i came into the house was  i believe  on the subject of the murderÃ¢  the first time  i believe  i spoke  or richard spoke to me  was   it is a shocking thing  do you consider he could not have done it himself  Ã¢  the reply i made was   richard  how could it be possible for persons to do such things themselves  having their hands tied and their eyes blindfolded  is it likely  Ã¢  that is all the conversation i remember between richard and me  till afterwardsÃ¢  he was sitting at the table a few minutes after  then got up and went into the back placeÃ¢  he went through the wash house  as if he was going to the privyÃ¢  he said his inside was out of order  and he went out at the door as ifgoing to the privyÃ¢  he did not remain there more than six or seven minutesÃ¢  i mentioned to my wife a circumstance which had occurred  and when he came back and sat down i was eating some bacon on a piece of breadÃ¢  i cut off a piece of baconÃ¢  it fell on my knee  and went a contrary way to himÃ¢  i then cut another piece  and it went towards his legsÃ¢  i did it purposely  to satisfy myself of something i thought concerning him  that he had got a new pair of shoesÃ¢  i had a suspicion that he knew something about itÃ¢  then i did a thing which i have no doubt he understood  i took the candle off the table  and put it between his legsÃ¢  he directly put up his legs and hid his shoes behind the legs of the chair  and then began the conversationÃ¢  he said he had been over the water to see his cousin  who had a pair of shoes which did not fit him  and he had jumped into themÃ¢  before that  he said he should like to have something to eat  and asked if i would go and fetch him a slice of bacon and a pot of beerÃ¢  i said   richard  why not go yourself and fetch it  Ã¢  he said   you know i don t want to go out Ã¢  i knew that there was an assault warrant out against himÃ¢  i fetched him a slice of bacon  a pot of beer  and half an ounce of tobaccoÃ¢  he gave me 1s  to pay for itÃ¢  he said he had been over to clapham  limehouse  blackwall  and that way  and called on hit cousins and aunts  and they had given him some moneyÃ¢  he did not say how muchÃ¢  after i had fetched the beer we had some conversation respecting the preceding night  what a shocking  dreadful affair it was  how any body could have committed such a horrible crimeÃ¢  it was no more than common conversation respecting the murderÃ¢  the conversation took place chiefly with my wifeÃ¢  i did not pay attention  my attendon was engaged at that timeÃ¢  i recollect asking richard how it was he was so lateÃ¢  he said he had been to mr  frimley s till twelve o clock  and when he came from there he lit on some friends who detained himÃ¢  i should say he was in bed before nine o clock on tuesday night  or about that timeÃ¢  when he had gone to bed  in consequence of suspicions i entertained  i bolted him inÃ¢  i did not give information at allÃ¢  the policemen came at eleven o clock that night  as near as i can tell  and took himÃ¢  i had at one time a cheese knife in my possession  which i have since foundÃ¢  i had also a piece of wood in my possessionÃ¢  i believe it was plum tree or damson  rather better than a foot and a half long  and about two and a i half inches wide  with sharp edges  and flatÃ¢  it was very smoothÃ¢  the edges were sharpÃ¢  it was to set seams withÃ¢  it is a heavy woodÃ¢  i used it in my business q  have you told us all the conversation  as far as you recollect  that took place between you and the prisoner on the subject of the murder  a  as far as happened  except part that my wife was speaking to himÃ¢  there was a conversation on scriptureÃ¢  i recollect in one part richard said  if the ten commandments were just  or the mosaic law was right  he had broken them all  for adultery he had committed many times  and drunkennessÃ¢  and then that conversation dropped with me  and went on with my wifeÃ¢  i got up to go into the yardÃ¢  that was at the time we were talking of the murderÃ¢  it was all in the same conversationÃ¢  i saw some money produced in a stocking at the station house at islingtonÃ¢  neither the money or the stocking was my propertyÃ¢  i believe one farthing was all the money in the house at all that dayÃ¢  i have never been in the habit of keeping money in the wash house or privyÃ¢  we have not had any to do it cross examined  q  were you present during all the time your wifewas in conversation with the prisoner that evening  a  certainly notÃ¢  i went to fetch some beer  therefore i could notÃ¢  i went to fetch the beer and bacon after he came homeÃ¢  it was not his bacon i cut when i discovered his shoes  it was my own baconÃ¢  i did that while the prisoner was sitting at the table  before i went to fetch his baconÃ¢  i believe i ate my own supper before i fetched his q  at that time had there been any conversation about the murder  a  the conversation might have been about the murder  but i took very little notice of any of the conversation  therefore am not bound to answer the question q  now i ask you to answer the question  had any conversation taken place about the murder before  as you say  you cut the bacon  and saw his new shoes  a  i have already answered that the conversation when i entered the house was on that subject  but i paid so little attention to the conversation between my wife and the prisoner  that probably i could not utter fifty words of the conversation the whole evening  unless the prisoner spoke to meÃ¢  i mean  i could not utter fifty words of the conversation between the prisoner and my wife  except i had the leading point to lead to it  namedÃ¢  there was a good deal of conversation between him and my wifeÃ¢  i had some suspicion at the time i discovered the new shoesÃ¢  i cannot say whether it was after that that i went and fetched the bacon for the prisonerÃ¢  i believe i had eaten my own supper before i fetched it  but i will not swear itÃ¢  i am not confident whether the bacon was cooked before or after q  at the time you went out to fetch the bacon  had you any suspicion as you have stated  a  certainly i had at the time  and beforeÃ¢  i had before he came into the houseÃ¢  i fetched it from a person of the name ofÃ¢  Ã¢  i cannot recollectÃ¢  it was about a hundred yards offÃ¢  i was absent about ten minutes or a quarter of an hourÃ¢  on my return i found the prisoner sitting at the table in conversation with my wifeÃ¢  as soon as his bacon was cooked he had his supper  smoked his pipe  and went to bedÃ¢  when i bolted him in his bed room i said   he is in  he shall never come out any snore by me Ã¢  if my face had been towards him i think he may have heard that  but my back being towards him  he might or might notÃ¢  it is a question i cannot answerÃ¢  i sever bolted him in beforeÃ¢  i have merely put the bolt to to keep the children in of a morning  but not bolted him inÃ¢  the window of his room looks into the front gardenÃ¢  it is about two feet and a half or three feet from the groundÃ¢  i cannot tell whether he paid me for the old shoes which i made himÃ¢  what i have no dealings with i never answer  i left it to my wifeÃ¢  he paid her in part  whether she had the whole i cannot tell  i know nothing of itÃ¢  i have been ill this twelvemonth  and have had very little dealings with any person whateverÃ¢  i have done very little shoe making within the last twelve monthsÃ¢  i was once in the policeÃ¢  i left it  i think  eight years agoÃ¢  i went after the first division that went to whitechapelÃ¢  i was in it  as near as i can tell  a year and four or five monthsÃ¢  i left it entirely of my own accord  without any complaint being made q  now  do i understand you distinctly that there was a great deal of conversation that you cannot recollect  a  yes  distinctly  that i know nothing of whateverÃ¢  if it were repeated  i believe  i might then tell  but not without  for i did not pay the least attention to itÃ¢  i did not take any notice  very little indeed  for my thoughts were far beyond any conversationÃ¢  i did not want to hold any conversationÃ¢  my two children slept with the prisonerÃ¢  one is about six years old at michaelmas  and the other four years oldÃ¢  they were in the bed with him that night court  q  why did you bar the door  i do not understand  a  because i had a suspicion he knew something of the chargeÃ¢  barring the door would prevent his getting out q  could he not get out of the window  a  that he might  but he could not get into my room  and if he had got out of the door i did not mean to go to sleepÃ¢  i was not particularly afraid of him  but i did not intend that he should have gone out of my house  without he did get upÃ¢  if he did get up i should have given informationÃ¢  it was for the public interest as well as my own mary ann allbn  i am the wife of the last witness  the prisoner lodged at our house  and did so on the 17th of march lastÃ¢  i do not know mr  templeman s cottage  i never saw itÃ¢  i know it is but a short distance

week he has been with us since he had been at the barnsbury castle public houseÃ¢  he was with us from saturday night till the tuesday week  a week and two daysÃ¢  he did not pay meÃ¢  i never received any money from him for that  because he had noneÃ¢  he told me he had no money many times court  q  did he not pay you at any time during the twelvemonth  a  yesÃ¢  the last time he came to us was the saturday week previous to the murder mr  ballantine  q  when did he tell you he had no money  a  frequentlyÃ¢  he did not take his meals with us generally since he has been out of employÃ¢  he did not take his meals with us at all in this week  only after the sundayÃ¢  he took his meals with us two sundaysÃ¢  mrs  jarvis brought him some bacon and eggs on the sunday morning  as he came on saturday nightÃ¢  on the following sunday   the sunday previous to the murder   he asked me if i had any breakfast  he wanted some breakfastÃ¢  i did not answer him  because we had none in the house ourselvesÃ¢  that was between eight and nine o clockÃ¢  he said he should go over the water to his cousin s  but his handkerchief was so dirty  and i lent him a stock of my husband sÃ¢  he then went out directlyÃ¢  he returned at one o clock in the dayÃ¢  i was at homeÃ¢  he said he had been out  and drank too much beer  and it had made him very ill on an empty stomachÃ¢  he went out  and was very sickÃ¢  he came in again  and i asked him if he would have some dinnerÃ¢  he said he was too illÃ¢  he asked if he might lie downÃ¢  i said he might  and he did soÃ¢  my little boy called him up at five o clock  for me to make the bed  and put the children to bedÃ¢  he had gone to lie down in his own roomÃ¢  my children slept with himÃ¢  he got up  and came into the room where i was sittingÃ¢  he asked me if i had got any teaÃ¢  i told him i had notÃ¢  he asked me to let my little boy go and fetch him some  for he had taken 1s  while he was outÃ¢  my little boy did fetch him someÃ¢  he said   i have got 6d  left Ã¢  he gave my little boy 6d   and he fetched some tea and sugarÃ¢  i made him some toastÃ¢  he had his tea  and went to bedÃ¢  on the following morning   monday   before he got up  mrs  jarvis came  i think  about eight o clock  or a little afterÃ¢  she came to my door and asked if richard was upÃ¢  i said   no Ã¢  i opened the door  and she called   richard Ã¢  if the front door is open you can hear any bodyspeak at the door in his bed roomÃ¢  she said   make haste and get up  it is breakfast time Ã¢  she then went outÃ¢  she did not go into his roomÃ¢  he got up directly  and said   i must make haste  if not i shall be too late for my breakfast   and he went outÃ¢  that was the last i saw of him that dayÃ¢  i was ill that night  and went to bed before eight o clockÃ¢  my husband went to bed at the same time q  are you able to say at what time the prisoner came home  a  yes  i think it was past two o clock  i am quite sureÃ¢  when he came in i said   richard  it is morning Ã¢  he said   it is early Ã¢  he then went into his bed roomÃ¢  he did not fasten the doorÃ¢  he had no fastening insideÃ¢  on the tuesday morning he got up at half past seven o clockÃ¢  i had been up ever since six o clock  and was getting my husband s breakfastÃ¢  i bad not gone to sleep after the prisoner came inÃ¢  i was weaning my baby  and did not go to sleep any moreÃ¢  my baby was so restless  i got out of bed three timesÃ¢  it was soon daylight after he came homeÃ¢  it was moonlight when he came home  it was very lightÃ¢  i was up three times after be came in  before six o clock  and i did not go to sleepÃ¢  i began weaning my baby that day and she was very illÃ¢  i watched the morning  and i know it was towards morning when he came inÃ¢  i am quite sure it was near three o clockÃ¢  we have no clock in the houseÃ¢  i am quite sure it was nearer three than two o clock  but i say two o clock court  q  how came you to say between one and two o clock before  a  i said  from one o clock Ã¢  i was sure it was quite towards morning  because it was so soon daylight q  that is no answer to why you should say between one and two o clock  a  i cannot speak nearer than i haveÃ¢  i know it was soon morning  and i did not go to sleep after he came inÃ¢  it was very bright moonlight when he came in mr  ballantine  q  you say you were in the room at the time the prisoner came into it in the morning  a  yes  in my own roomÃ¢  he went immediately through my room into the wash houseÃ¢  there is a privy connected with the wash houseÃ¢  he went into the privy  for i heard the door  and the door makes a noiseÃ¢  about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards i went into the wash house  and saw him standing by the table doing something to his trowsersÃ¢  i did not stand long enough to notice what he was doingÃ¢  i turned away  and went into my own roomÃ¢  it was to the top part of his trowsers that he was doing somethingÃ¢  he was not stooping  but standing uprightÃ¢  i cannot say whether he was wiping or rubbing them  or what he was doingÃ¢  i did not pay attentionÃ¢  i do not think he was buttoning themÃ¢  he did not appear buttoning themÃ¢  i did not stop long enough to notice whether the privy door was shutÃ¢  he was quite out of the privy  standing by the window in the wash houseÃ¢  i then returned into the sitting roomÃ¢  i suppose it was ten minutes  or not quite so long  before he came inÃ¢  i did not pay any attentionÃ¢  he asked for a towel when he came in  which i gave him  and he wiped his face with itÃ¢  it might be twenty minutes from the time he went into the wash house till he came out  or it might be longerÃ¢  it might be half an hourÃ¢  i heard the noise of the privy door once  when he went inÃ¢  my husband was going to send me again  as he wanted something out of the wash house  but i said   no  i won t go in  for richard is doing something to his trowsers  and i did not goÃ¢  i do not know how long he remained in the privyÃ¢  when he came out he bid me good morning  and went outÃ¢  i did not pay any attention to his shoes at that timeÃ¢  he returned at a quarter past seven o clock in theeveningÃ¢  i had in the mean time heard of the death of mr  templemanÃ¢  my husband had gone out when the prisoner returnedÃ¢  i said   it is well you have come in so soon to night  richard  i would not have left my door open any more  in consequence of the murder and robbery near me Ã¢  upon which he said   i have just heard something about it at the rainbow Ã¢  he had just called at rainbowÃ¢  i asked him how it was he had not heard of it beforeÃ¢  in a few minutes after that my husband came in  and he stood by the tableÃ¢  he came in as i was speaking to richard  and the conversation droppedÃ¢  after my husband came in he went through my room to the privyÃ¢  that might be a minute after my husband came inÃ¢  it might be two  i cannot sayÃ¢  when he came back he said   i don t feel very well  i suppose i am horror struck like the rest Ã¢  he then asked my husband to fetch him a drop of beer  and he fetched him some beer  a rasher of bacon  and tobaccoÃ¢  while my husband was gone for the beer  i said   this is a shocking affair  richard Ã¢  he said   it is  i know very little about it Ã¢  i asked him where he had been that dayÃ¢  he told me he bad been and called on his aunt  or seen his aunt  i do not know which  and he had had good luck  and the old lady was glad to see himÃ¢  and he had called on his cousin  and his cousin had a pair of shoes that were too large for him  and he had given them to himÃ¢  my husband came in during the latter part of this conversation with the beer and things he had been sent out forÃ¢  i put the rasher on the fire  and broiled it for the prisoner  and he ate itÃ¢  we then went on talking togetherÃ¢  i asked him where he had been over nightÃ¢  he said he bad been to the rainbow public house  that be went in with a pint  and came out with a pintÃ¢  i said   you could not have been there till that time in the morning Ã¢  he said   i was gossipping Ã¢  that is all he saidÃ¢  there was other conversationÃ¢  i do not know of any thing particularÃ¢  he said  in speaking of his situation   many poor creatures like me would rather be hung than transported Ã¢  he was speaking of the difficulties he was in  that he was out of work  and in trouble  and a good deal of conversation to that effectÃ¢  he had often said he had never known so much trouble as he had done this winterÃ¢  i saw the stocking in which the money was found in the privy q  do know to whom that stocking belonged  a  i saw a pair of stockings rolled up on a box  at the side of the prisoner s bed on monday afternoon  at the time i made the bedÃ¢  i cannot say whether it was five o clock  or what timeÃ¢  it was in the afternoonÃ¢  it might be five o clockÃ¢  it was while the prisoner was outÃ¢  i took hold of the stockings and laid them down  and thought to myself  they are richard s stockingsÃ¢  i knew them to be similar to what he always woreÃ¢  i washed for himÃ¢  they were exactly like what he wore  and did not belong to meÃ¢  they belonged to richardÃ¢  they did not belong to me  and are like what i used to wash for himÃ¢  i believe them to be hisÃ¢  he had two pain of stockings when i washed for him  before he went to mr  bartlett sÃ¢  i washed for him three weeks after he went thereÃ¢  i had washed a pair of stockings similar to those for him  just before christmasÃ¢  that is all i knowÃ¢  my children s clothes were not kept in that roomÃ¢  nobody s clothes but the prisoner s would be kept in that roomÃ¢  they were two odd stockings  i had mismatched them when i washed them  i think it must have been six week before christmas when i mis matched themÃ¢  these were formerly two pairs  and i put one stocking of one pair to another court  q  but he could have rightly matched them afterwards  a he never did while i washed for him  because they came off together  and were washed together mr  ballantine  q  do you remember his coming home wet footed one day  a  when he was out with baked potatoes he came home wet in the feet  and i gave him a dirty stocking to pot on  a dry oneÃ¢  that is the way they became mismatchedÃ¢  directly i saw the stocking in which the money was found  i said that was the one i had seenÃ¢  i knew it belonged to richard  and it was on the box on the mondayÃ¢  i am quite sure of thatÃ¢  i am quite sure it was the same stocking i had seen by the side of the bed on monday cross examined  q  who washed for him when he returned to lodge with you for the week  a  i do not knowÃ¢  his dirty things were not sent to the washÃ¢  i never saw any in the houseÃ¢  they were not pot up in a bundleÃ¢  none of his things were put up in a bundleÃ¢  i never said any thing about a bundleÃ¢  i never said i opened a bundle  to ascertain whether they were two stockings  or odd onesÃ¢  i have no recollection of saying any thing about the stockings being in a bundleÃ¢  they laid folded together on the box  one turned over the other  rolled up  and the one produced to me was the one which laid outsideÃ¢  they were rolled up in a bundle  the same as a clean pair of stockingsÃ¢  i did not unrol the bundleÃ¢  they were rolled up in the ordinary form of a pair of stockings  one doubled over the otherÃ¢  the one the money was produced in was the outer stockingÃ¢  i did not unrol them at all on the mondayÃ¢  i took them in my handÃ¢  i do not know who washed for him thenÃ¢  there was no mark on the stockingsÃ¢  i do not think the prisoner bad been out of place above a fortnight when he came to lodge with us the last timeÃ¢  he came and had a night s lodging now and thenÃ¢  i do not know how long he had left mr  bartlett  of the barnsbury castle public house  when he came the last weekÃ¢  when he was in employment he paid me 2s  a weekÃ¢  we never made any agreement this timeÃ¢  i knew he was out of emyloyment and never asked him for any thingÃ¢  if he had got any employment i should have expected the same weekly sumÃ¢  he did not board with usÃ¢  it was the sunday morning after the saturday that he came that mrs  jarvis brought him some bacon and bread for his breakfastÃ¢  it was on the monday morning she came and called him to come to breakfastÃ¢  he was in bed  and she was outside the houseÃ¢  it was after eight o clock  it might be ten minutes after eightÃ¢  he owed us some money for his former lodgingÃ¢  he often  asked me for an account  but as he had no money i never gave it himÃ¢  i never cast it upÃ¢  it might be 1l  or more  if i east it up  because i often let him have his dinner  and any thing of that sortÃ¢  he told me  several times during the week  that he had no moneyÃ¢  he told me he was in great difficulties  and was without moneyÃ¢  many times he mentioned the subject q  you have ventured to say now that it was past two o clock  were you always of that opinion  a  yes  always of opinion that it was towards morningÃ¢  i was always of opinion it was past two o clock when he came inÃ¢  i am quite sure it was after two o clock  according to the time it was daylight afterwardsÃ¢  to the best of my belief it was after two o clockÃ¢  i cannot say whether i was certain of the time when i went to the police office  as i was very much flurried and ill q  did you not believe  when at the police office  that it was between one and two o clock  a  certainly it must have been two o clock fromthe time it was lightÃ¢  i think it was two o clockÃ¢  i believed it was two o clock  because it got so soon daylight  but i had no clock q  since you have been at the police office  have you conversed with your husband about the time he came home  a  my husband said  when he came home   mary  richard did not come home till morning Ã¢  i believe my husband did not speak when the prisoner came in  because i spokeÃ¢  i did not ask my husband whether he was awake  nor did i speakÃ¢  i was out of bed three times to nurse my childÃ¢  the prisoner got up between seven and eight o clock next morning  and went through the wash house to the privyÃ¢  there is a catch to the privy doorÃ¢  it is what i term a night boltÃ¢  it shuts and boltsÃ¢  there is another entrance to it from the gardenÃ¢  if the door is shut you must go through the wash houseÃ¢  if the door is open you can come in that wayÃ¢  the bolt is in the wash houseÃ¢  it is the wash house door boltÃ¢  the privy door was off its hinges at that timeÃ¢  the privy joins the wash house  and when in the privy you can go out of the privy into the gardenÃ¢  you cannot get into the wash house without the door is left openÃ¢  you can get to the privy  through the wash house  without going into the gardenÃ¢  the privy has two doorsÃ¢  the door leading to the garden was off its hinges at that timeÃ¢  i heard of mr  templeman s death  i think  at twelve o clock in the dayÃ¢  i had been outÃ¢  my husband went up  and he told me all the particulars when he came home  of the old gentleman being murderedÃ¢  i cannot remember whether be told me any thing about the state he was found in on the floorÃ¢  i knew all about it  and began to talk to the prisoner about it before my husband came inÃ¢  when he came in he broke upon the conversation q  was his going for the bacon and beer the only occasion when your husband went out that night  a  yesÃ¢  with the exception of that interval he heard every thing that took placeÃ¢  when my husband said richard had got a new pair of shoes  i said   i think not  i think he has blacked and shined his old ones Ã¢  he said so to me the moment richard walked across the room  while he was gone to the privyÃ¢  when he came back from the privy he asked my husband to fetch him a drop of beer  and i believe he went out to fetch itÃ¢  i think he was eating his supper court  q  when did your husband remark about his having new shoes  a  when he came in  he walked through the room  and went into the privy before he sat down  when he came in in the evening q  i thought your husband was out when he came in  a  my husband was out  but he had stood talking to me by the table  and had not sat down when my husband came in mr  chambers  q  was it in consequence of your husband saying he had new shoes that he said he got them from his cousin  a  i do not know  but he said thatÃ¢  i did not ask him about the shoesÃ¢  my husband looked at them  and so did iÃ¢  i never asked where he got themÃ¢  he said he had been very lucky that day q  was it not after that  he talked so despondingly as you say about being such an unlucky man  a  it was during the conversation mr  ballantine  q  you did not unrol the stockings by the bedside  a  no  i merely took them in my handÃ¢  when they brought me the stocking in  i said   there was a pair of stockings on the box on monday Ã¢  i am quite sure that was the outside stocking the money was tied in  and i am quite sure  by the feel of the stockings  that there was more than one court  q  how could you tell there were two odd ones  a  i said to the policeman   there is a pair of stockings Ã¢  the policeman found the other slocking in my room  behind the boxÃ¢  they were two odd stockings  and i said i had mis matched them when i

halfpence in his pocket  and if either of as would bet odd or even  he might have enough for a pint  but nobody betted with himÃ¢  he then played at skittles for a pot of beer  i believeÃ¢  he had some beer to drinkÃ¢  i think it was very near eleven o clock when we came out of thereÃ¢  i know he did not lose any thing  because i was in the ground all the timeÃ¢  he did not win any moneyÃ¢  he won beerÃ¢  he did not say any thing after playing that i heardÃ¢  i went into the tap room with him afterwardsÃ¢  when he first came into the ground he said he had three halfpence  and as he did not

turned offÃ¢  the people did not all come outtogetherÃ¢  i went out firstÃ¢  they came about five minutes afterÃ¢  i observed the prisoner particularlyÃ¢  he had on a fustian coat  the same he has on nowÃ¢  i noticed it because i saw something in his right hand pocketÃ¢  it was long  and thick at one endÃ¢  it was in the outside side pocket  like a shooting jacket pocketÃ¢  there were two pockets  one on each side  rather in frontÃ¢  no part of what he had was uncoveredÃ¢  it must have been about a quarter to twelve o clock when i noticed itÃ¢  it was at the time he was going awayÃ¢  i did not see pizey go for the candleÃ¢  the instrument was the length of his pocketÃ¢  it was lying long ways in his pocket  across the bottom of his pocketÃ¢  the ends seemed to be differentÃ¢  i saw this in

recollect which way he went james miller  i am an inspector of the n division of police  i apprehended the prisoner at allen s cottage  on tuesday night  the 17th of march  at a quarter after eleven o clockÃ¢  i found him in the bed room  in bed with two childrenÃ¢  i said   gould  gould Ã¢  he appeared to arouse from sleep  and said   what  what  Ã¢  i said nothing more at that momentÃ¢  a light was procured  and i again roused him  and said   gould  get up and dress yourselfÃ¢  he appeared still drowsyÃ¢  i told him to get upÃ¢  he then got out of bed  and on getting out of bed  he said   where is your warrant   i replied   i don t need a warrant Ã¢  he then said   what do you want me for then  Ã¢  i said   i suppose you have beard of the murder Ã¢  it is that i want you for Ã¢  he smiled  and said   if i was as innocent of every thing as i am of that  i should not have much to fear Ã¢  i do not recollect his saying any thing more thenÃ¢  as he was packing up his clothes to dress himself  i found 9s  in his trowsers  pockets  all in shillingsÃ¢  while i was counting it  i asked what money he had  and he said 9s Ã¢  in his waist coat pocket i found seven lucifer matches  and two duplicates for a pair of trowsers and a jacket  dated   22nd february  1340  2s  6d    and  25th february  1840  35  Ã¢  one in the name of richard gould  and the other in the name of ann

missed him for some time  and asked where he had beenÃ¢  he said   to norwich Ã¢  i searched him at the station house  and took off his feet a pair of new shoes  or ankle boots  which i produceÃ¢  i asked him where he bought themÃ¢  he said  in kent streetÃ¢  a constable who was standing by  said   the borough  Ã¢  the prisoner said   yes Ã¢  i then asked him what he had done with his old onesÃ¢  he replied   thrown them away Ã¢  shortly after that  i minutely examined his clothes  and took from him this waist coat  which he was wearing at the timeÃ¢  he had three waistcoats onÃ¢  two besides thisÃ¢  this was the middle oneÃ¢  this waistcoat i noticed at the time was stained with blood  and it is also burnt in one particular spot  as if a cinder or a pipe had fallen on itÃ¢  on my saying that the waistcoatwas stained with blood  the prisoner said his clothes had often been stained with bloodÃ¢  i afterwards went to allen s cottage that same morning court  q  have you had the waistcoat examined in the same way as a bag was  a  noÃ¢  the bag was examined  and discovered that what was upon it was not bloodÃ¢  this has not been examined in the same way mr  jones  q  did you search the bed room in which you apprehended the prisoner  a  i did  and found this single stocking thereÃ¢  it is a fine stockingÃ¢  it was lying on a chair by the side of a boxÃ¢  it was dirtyÃ¢  the prisoner bad stockings on when he dressed himselfÃ¢  i have examined them sinceÃ¢  they were a pair  i believeÃ¢  i did not take them offÃ¢  perhaps i did not take notice enough to say whether they were a pair or notÃ¢  i judged they were a pairÃ¢  i did not show that stocking to mrs  allenÃ¢  i did not search any other part of allen s premises  except the bed room  where i took the prisonerÃ¢  i found the stocking about a quarter after eight o clock on the wednesday morning cross examined  q  you went there about a quarter past eleven o clock  a  i didÃ¢  allen opened the door to meÃ¢  we were not more

know what service he was inÃ¢  i knew he had a certain engagement connected with the steam companyÃ¢  i remember going to ellis caspar s house in finsbury pavement  about the october previous to the 25th of march lastÃ¢  i was invited by mr  caspar to call thereÃ¢  we went to the synagogue togetherÃ¢  while there the prisoner came in  and we all three left the synagogue togetherÃ¢  ellis caspar

caspar knew where i lived  and on the sunday following i found him at my house when i got thereÃ¢  the prisoner was not with himÃ¢  he made a communication to me  in consequence of which i afterwards met him at williams s coffee house  in st  martin s le grandÃ¢  we ultimately went to charing cross together to a coffee room thereÃ¢  the prisoner came thereÃ¢  there were two or three strangers in the roomÃ¢  the prisoner said he wanted to speak to me  but not in the presence of strangersÃ¢  we walked out together into st  james s parkÃ¢  it was then darkÃ¢  ellis caspar was with us  and he said to the prisoner  lewin  i have brought moss  i have not told him any thing what you wanted with him  now tell him the business Ã¢  the prisoner said he wanted me to do him a favour  that was to call at his office  and bring a letter which his father would give me  and he would give me a box  which i was to take away and give it to his fatherÃ¢  i asked him what the box was to containÃ¢  he said he did not know  it was to oblige a friend of his in the countryÃ¢  he said probably stones  but it would make no difference  i should be satisfied for the trouble and loss of time i might sustainÃ¢  i made some objection  and he said it was such business a ticket porter might do  only he did not want his father to be seen in the businessÃ¢  he told me there could be no blame  if any  all the blame he would take on himselfÃ¢  the prisoner told me i was to meet his father at a coffee house opposite the monument the following morningÃ¢  he said it in his father s presence  so that he could hear itÃ¢  i was to go there about ten o clockÃ¢  i went  and met ellis casparÃ¢  he said when i met him that he would go and see lewinÃ¢  he left me to go and see for himÃ¢  he returned in a very few minutes  and brought the prisoner with himÃ¢  ellis caspar had a paper in his handÃ¢  the prisoner said the ship he expected the box to come by to him had not yet arrived  and he desired me  as i had lost so much time  to go home and call again in the afternoonÃ¢  i went again in the afternoon to the same place opposite the monumentÃ¢  i saw ellis caspar first  and he went and fetched the prisoner  who said the ship had arrived  but two of their ships had come in collision  and there was a great deal of damage done to them  and the ship could not be unloaded  the box which was for him was at the bottom of the ship  and could not be unloaded till next morningÃ¢  we met next morning at the same placeÃ¢  the prisoner said he thought his friend had made a fool of him  for the box his friend had sent was too heavy for any person to carryÃ¢  i asked him if it could not be fetched in a coachÃ¢  he said   no   he did not wish it to be fetched in that way  as he was afraid the coachman might know his father  and he did not wish his father to be known in the businessÃ¢  he gave me half a sovereign on that occasion  and before we separated he asked me where i could be found when he wanted meÃ¢  he and his father walked a little way  then turned to me  and said they should not want me then  and asked me where i was to be foundÃ¢  i said i was always to be found at my employer sÃ¢  i was then in the service of mr  joshua hyams  a watchmaker  whose service i have been in ten yearsÃ¢  i am not now in his house  but i work for himÃ¢  the prisoner objected to send there for me  and asked  if i was not at home  whether i should be found if he directed a note for me  and he told me he should direct a note  not in his own nameÃ¢  we then partedÃ¢  we afterwards met in finsbury square  very shortly after  a few days  perhaps a day or two afterÃ¢  the prisoner came to that meeting  and ellis caspar tooÃ¢  we met in thesquareÃ¢  i do not precisely recollect what passed  but i recollect it was not on the business of taking away the boxÃ¢  it was some other businessÃ¢  we had several meetings of no importanceÃ¢  at one time of meeting the prisoner asked me what kind of hand i wroteÃ¢  that was at least four months before the 25th of marchÃ¢  i wrote my name and address on a piece of paper that the prisoner had in his pocket  and handed it to himÃ¢  he said that would do admirably  and asked me if i would write for him two forms of letters that he would give meÃ¢  i was to copy two forms  and give them to himÃ¢  he lent me a letter  and said that hand writing i was to imitate as nearly as possibleÃ¢  he lent me the letter for that purposeÃ¢  i recollect the contents of that letter perfectlyÃ¢  i did not return the letter to him immediately i had done what he requestedÃ¢  i kept it by me till the day before the 25th of march  when the prisoner came to my house  i then gave it to himÃ¢  this is the letterÃ¢   looking at no 6 Ã¢  i mentioned my recollection of the contents of it before the magistrate  before the  letter was shown to meÃ¢  i had a recollection of the contents of the letter  before it was shown to me before the magistrateÃ¢  after that letter was given to me  two forms were given to me by the prisonerÃ¢  i cannot exactly recollect when  but it was a considerable time before the transaction took place  some monthsÃ¢  i copied them  and returned them to the prisoner  with the formsÃ¢  i made two copies  because the first he said the ink was too pale  and the paper would not doÃ¢  he destroyed them in my presenceÃ¢  there were spaces left to be filled upÃ¢  i wrote a second copy for himÃ¢  these two letters  nos  3 and 4  are two of themÃ¢  i wrote those two forms  but the date was not there when i wrote them  and several

wassunday  the 24th of march Ã¢  i told him i had business i was obliged to transact that morning  and did not think it would be convenient for me to comeÃ¢  ellis caspar said it would be a very good excuse to me to be out  at i told him i had out door business to do  and he said the business would not occupy many minutesÃ¢  i agreed to meet them i think in mark laneÃ¢  i was to meet both i supposedÃ¢  i went to mark lane  about ten o clock next morning  and met ellis and lewin caspar together  i think in fenchurch streetÃ¢  as i was going along  lewin caspar left his father  and ellis caspar came up to me  and said something to me  and we went together into a house in mark lane i thinkÃ¢  he gave me a letter there  and a blue bag at the same timeÃ¢  the letter was folded at that time  and the address was torn off as it is nowÃ¢  i went the same day with that letter in a cab  to mr  hartley s office  in john street  and delivered it to the prisoner thereÃ¢  this receipt  which is written across the letter  is my hand writingÃ¢  i wrote that on it at the wharf  when i went there for the boxes  after i had been in the city about my own businessÃ¢  i was asked to write a receipt on the letterÃ¢  i had to deliver an order for my employer for twelve lever watches  and i received 50l  on accountÃ¢  this is the cheque i received that morningÃ¢   looking at no  9  Ã¢  i signed my name across it as an acknowledgment of itÃ¢  when i received the letter from ellis caspar be told me what to do with itÃ¢  i took it to mr  hartley s office in john street  in consequence of what he told me  and inquired for mr  hartleyÃ¢  lewin caspar was sent out to meÃ¢  i was in the cab thenÃ¢  i handed him the letterÃ¢  he went into the office  leaving me in the cabÃ¢  he came out again with the letter i had given him  and another one which he compared togetherÃ¢  he put his hand inside the cab with the two letters  one in each band  and examined them jury  q  how long was he before he came out  a  not above a minute or two mr  clarkson  q  did he say any thing on comparing the two letters  a  he said there was a mistake  and asked me to step out into his office  and he would correct itÃ¢  i got out and went through the front office into the back office on the left hand sideÃ¢  there was nobody there besides me and himÃ¢  i observed clerks in the outer office which i passed throughÃ¢  when we got into the inner room  the prisoner made some alteration  in one of the lettersÃ¢  i cannot say which  nor what the alteration wasÃ¢  the words at the bottom of this letter   mr  bristow  please deliver above  messrs  carne have advised me about them Ã¢  l  caspar   was written by the prisoner while i was in the roomÃ¢  this is the letter  part of which i had previously written at his requestÃ¢  he then gave me the letter to go to the wharfÃ¢  he wrote the direction of the wharf i think on another part of the letterÃ¢  here it is on the back   inquire for mr  bristow  dublin steam wharf  irongate Ã¢  he told me to go to the wharf  and get these things  and he should be there as soon as meÃ¢  he told me i should have to give an acknowledgment on the letter  and told me not to write my own name  and told me some name that i was to write  but which i forgot in the interval while i had been about my own businessÃ¢  it was in bread street that i was to deliver my master s goodsÃ¢  i went there  and from there to the wharfÃ¢  i got into another cab to go thereÃ¢  i discharged the first cab somewhere by the globe insurance officeÃ¢  i cannot precisely recollect where i took the other  but it was close on the same spotÃ¢  i went to the wharf  and inquired for mr  hartleyÃ¢  i think one of the porters came to me  or somebody about the officeÃ¢  i afterwards saw mr  bristow q  why did you inquire for mr  hartley  a  i thought probably he might be at that place  though not at the other  as the clerk who first came out at john street  said   mr  hartley is not here  but the agent is Ã¢  i was in the cab when mr  bristow came out to meÃ¢  i gave him the order the prisoner had given meÃ¢  mr  bristow desired me to come into the officeÃ¢  i went in and saw two boxes thereÃ¢  mr  bristow said   these are the boxes  will you take them with you  Ã¢  the porter placed them in the cab i came by  by mr  bristow s desire  and i gave him 1s Ã¢  i then wrote this receipt on the letter  and left the letter with mr  bristowÃ¢  i put one of the boxes into the blue bag  which ellis caspar had given meÃ¢  it was not large enough to hold bothÃ¢  i was desired to meet ellis caspar in wood streetÃ¢  i went there in the cab  but he was not there when i got thereÃ¢  i went to the cross keys public house  wood streetÃ¢  the boxes were taken out of the cab by one of the porters there  without being directed to do so  and put on the counter  supposing i was going by one of the coachesÃ¢  not finding ellis caspar there  i wanted to get a cord to tie the boxes together to carry them  but could not get oneÃ¢  i got another cab  put them in  and drove to my own home near the london hospital with themÃ¢  i drove to the london hospital  mile end road  near the corner of turner streetÃ¢  the man by mistake drove me past the turning at which i intended to get out  which was the corner of turner street  and took me to the next street  which is at the corner of the hospitalÃ¢  i then took out one of the boxes  and went home with it to no  12  new street  and left the other one in the cabÃ¢  i put it in my bed roomÃ¢  i came out with intent to fetch the other  and met ellis caspar in the streetÃ¢  i told what i had done with one box  and where the other wasÃ¢  in consequence of what he said to me  i got into the cab again  and was driven to the commercial road  merely to delay the timeÃ¢  that was in a direction from my houseÃ¢  it was to avoid my own houseÃ¢  the box was still in the cab thenÃ¢  i ultimately took the second box to my houseÃ¢  i had at that time a servant named jane bradleyÃ¢  i got out of the cab at the end of commercial road  discharged the man  and returned by the omnibusÃ¢  i got home about eight or half past eight o clockÃ¢  i had tea  and went to the earl st  vincent public house  which is in the neighbourhoodÃ¢  jane bradley fetched me from thereÃ¢  on going home i found ellis caspar waiting in the front parlour for meÃ¢  i had a conversation with ellis caspar about the boxes  and he then told me what they containedÃ¢  the servant did not sleep at the houseÃ¢  she went home after some timeÃ¢  it was very late before ellis caspar wentÃ¢  i sent the girl home some hours before he went away  rather before the usual time  by ellis caspar s desireÃ¢  i desired my wife to send her awayÃ¢  there was a fire in my back parlourÃ¢  i went up into my bed room with ellis caspar  and showed him the boxesÃ¢  they were taken down stairs to the back parlourÃ¢  there were seals on all four sides of each of the boxesÃ¢  ellis caspar put the lid of one box on the fireÃ¢  i lent him a chisel to get the cover off  that was the wooden cover  they were secured by nails merely as a packingcaseÃ¢  after that box was opened there was a tin box enclosedÃ¢  there was a quantity of hay between the wood and the tin q  what was the box broken for at first  a  it was by desire of ellis caspar to divide the contents into smaller portionsÃ¢  the tin box was considerably smaller than the wooden oneÃ¢  upon finding that  the contents were not dividedÃ¢  there seemed then to be no necessity for itÃ¢  the other box was opened in the same wayÃ¢  the outside cases of both were burnt  every morsel and the hay ellis caspar took away in his handkerchiefÃ¢  he went away before the boxes were quite burnt  and after he was gone 1 took the tin boxes up into my bed room againÃ¢  as near as i can recollect  they were about as large as three of those octavo books   pointing to them  and about six  or eight inches longÃ¢  i opened one of the tin boxesÃ¢  it contained lumps of apparently ore of various coloursÃ¢  they had no appearance of goldÃ¢  i had never seen gold in that state beforeÃ¢  the sizes varied very much  some were larger than othersÃ¢  the largest was not larger than a child s fist  or a moderate sized orangeÃ¢  i placed the boxes in my bed room that night  put them in brown paper  and tied them round with packthread  to make them appear as parcelsÃ¢  next morning i put them into separate trunks  one into a black leather trunk of my own  and the other into a wooden trunk of my daughter s which had no lock on itÃ¢  i corded itÃ¢  the following morning i seat my wife to hire apartmentsÃ¢  that was in consequence of what passed between me and ellis caspar q  well  where were the tin boxes with the ere in them afterwards taken to  a  to mansel street  by my directions  and from thence by my sisterÃ¢  they were afterwards taken  i believe  to petticoat lane  and from thence the ore was brought to me at oxendon street  where i was then concealedÃ¢  i had not the boxes at oxendon streetÃ¢  the ore was taken out of the boxes before it was brought to meÃ¢  the last time i saw the tin boxes was at my place in mansel streetÃ¢  it was to davis s house in oxendon street that i went q  what became of you after this  a  i went to brentford for two days  and afterwards to peckham  to fishwick sÃ¢  i never saw the prisoner after thatÃ¢  i remained at fishwick s a fortnight  and then surrendered to the officerÃ¢  i supplied myself with the lodging at fishwick sÃ¢  i saw nothing of the prisoner at davis s houseÃ¢  i did not take the ore to davis sÃ¢  it was brought to me out of the boxesÃ¢  i desired davis to go for it to my sister s  in petticoat laneÃ¢  i told him they were there  and he said he should fetch themÃ¢  i delivered up some money to the officers when i surrenderedÃ¢  i received that money from davisÃ¢  it was notesÃ¢  i  think it was 140l court Ã¢  q  do you know of your own knowledge what became of the ore  a  only what i was informed ofÃ¢  i never saw it after it was taken from oxendon streetÃ¢  i did not receive the 140l  till nearly a fortnight afterÃ¢  it was given to me by davis in the coach as i was coming here to surrender myselfÃ¢  i do not know what has become of davisÃ¢  i saw him once at the office jury Ã¢  q  did davis know you were coming to surrender  a  yes  when he gave me the 140l  he came with meÃ¢  i came here for that purposeÃ¢  i have been in that dock  and was afterwards dischargedÃ¢  i do not exactly know what may be termed a dischargesÃ¢  it was last mondayÃ¢  i was discharged on the same day mr  clarkson Ã¢  q  do you know fiestel s coffee house  in tower street  a  yesÃ¢  i was there with the prisoner  it night be a month before this transactionÃ¢  i cannot state exactlyÃ¢  i left a handkerchief thereÃ¢   looking at a handkerchief produced by roe Ã¢  this is the one mr  jonesto mr  clarkson Ã¢  q  have you known it happen that there have been mistakes in the manifests  the bills of lading  and letters written at your house  a  i never knew such an instanceÃ¢  i have no recollection of letters having been written to correct errors which have been made q  was your receipt of these boxes from the captain of the sea gullthe first intimation you had of it  a  we received letters the day before with the bill of lading henry mosscross examined  q  had you worked for the prisoner s father in his house  a  yesÃ¢  i did not board thereÃ¢  i had ceased to work for him for some time before this subject was mentioned to meÃ¢  i had done nothing for him for many yearsÃ¢  when i used to meet any of the family we recognised each otherÃ¢  we were very seldom in the habit of visiting each other q  for how long before the subject was mentioned had you visited at caspar s house  a  i cannot sayÃ¢  i sometimes called in at his shop  perhaps it might be a year before  i cannot exactly rememberÃ¢  i know at one time mr  caspar asked me to do a job for him  when i met him by accident q  while you were in his service did you ever have to write  a  no  i had no occasion to writeÃ¢  i never had to make out invoices  or enter in any books  nothing of the kind q  do you mean to swear up to the time you mention  lewin caspar did not know what sort of hand you wrote  a  i do not think he possibly could have knownÃ¢  he might have seen me writing at his father sÃ¢  i might have made some little marksÃ¢  i cannot tell what he knew  i only know he asked me to show him what sort of hand i wroteÃ¢  i am perfectly persuaded he could not know what sort of hand i wroteÃ¢  he was very young when i was in his father s house  and might forget what hand i wrote  if i did write thereÃ¢  i will swear that i do not know he knew what hand i wroteÃ¢  i might occasionally have sent in accounts to ellis caspar in my own hand writingÃ¢  i have no recollection of having written a letter to him since i left him  but i will not swear it q  how many different statements have you made as to the part you took in this transaction  a  i never made but one myselfÃ¢  the statement made before was made for me  and not by meÃ¢  the first statement  which was false  was suggested to me by davis and mrs  abrahams  when they visited me at peckhamÃ¢  that statement was taken down in writingÃ¢  i wrote part of it myself  and gave it to davisÃ¢  i had some conversation with davis while i was writing itÃ¢  davis dictated to me what i should writeÃ¢  lewin caspar s name must have been mentioned in the course of that conversation mr  clarkson  q  did you write what davis dictated  a  yes court  q  had you any conversation which was not reduced to writing  a  i do not know what the conversation was preciselyÃ¢  i only know that by his dictation i wrote down what i didÃ¢  i have no hesitation in saying lewin caspar s name must have been mentioned mr  jones  q  you had conversations with davis on the whole subject  a  yesÃ¢  i have no doubt the prisoner s name was mentioned in those conversationsÃ¢  i have no hesitation in swearing itÃ¢  it is impossible to swear exactly  but i believe it wasÃ¢  i will swear  in conversation with davis  i did mention the prisoner  at that conversation when i was writing my statementÃ¢  i was never asked that question before to dayÃ¢  i gave that statement to davis  or mrs  abrahamsÃ¢  they were both togetherÃ¢  davis is my wife s father in lawÃ¢  he married her motherÃ¢  i do not like to own him myself  he is not quite so respectable as i could wishÃ¢  he keeps a good many bÃ¢  Ã¢  y housesÃ¢  i never lived in any of themÃ¢  i have been in one of themÃ¢  that was in coventry courtÃ¢  i had never been there beforeÃ¢  i have no doubtthat was a house of that sortÃ¢  i went from coventry court to oxendon street  a house i had never been in beforeÃ¢  i went to coventry court on thursday morning  and left there the following tuesday morningÃ¢  i have not seen davis since i saw him at the police officeÃ¢  he has left the countryÃ¢  i believe he was afraid of being taken in custody for thisÃ¢  i was in custody myself for several monthsÃ¢  i made a statement to mr  de mole when i surrendered myself  at the inn over the wayÃ¢  that was the first statement i made myselfÃ¢  that was besides the one 1 wrote at davis s dictationÃ¢  i made a third statement while i was in prisonÃ¢  the second statement i made  as near as i can recollect  corresponded with the first  and was equally falseÃ¢  the third was truth  and nothing but the truth  that i know ofÃ¢  i believe it contained what i have sworn to dayÃ¢  it was in writingÃ¢  i do not believe i read it over after i wrote itÃ¢  my sister  mrs  levy  and my wife  were also taken into custody on this chargeÃ¢  nobody else connected with me  i am quite certain q  now  when the prisoner told you he wanted you to do him a favour  did you ask him what it was about  to know if it was right or wrong  a  i did q  you would not have done what was wrong  a  if i was to assert that i should not be believed  in my present situationÃ¢  i thought i was not doing wrong  but i scarcely expect that to be believedÃ¢  when i went to the office i did not think i was going to steal 5000l  worth of gold dust  or i certainly would not have done it q  i suppose you have been very much surprised to find you committed a felony by it  a  it was a surprise at firstÃ¢  i have not got over it now  i shall never get over it  my feelings are too much hurt by itÃ¢  i wore the same coat i have on now when i went to the officeÃ¢  i was dressed very similar to what i am nowÃ¢  my whiskers were in just the same stateÃ¢  i never saw the prisoner after that day that i saw him at the office  except in custody q  what have you been doing with yourself since the last trial  a  employed at my businessÃ¢  i live now at no  126  cornwall road  lambethÃ¢  my business is carried on thereÃ¢  i work in the front roomÃ¢  it is a private house  with railings in frontÃ¢  i am a housekeeper thereÃ¢  i set up housekeeping the quarter before lastÃ¢  i had no communication with mr  hartley s solicitor  till after i heard the result of the investigation which took place after the last trialÃ¢  i then read it in the newspaperÃ¢  i have had a communication with mr  hartley s solicitor  since the last trialÃ¢  i was desired to go to know if i should be wanted  and told them where to find meÃ¢   looking at no  3 Ã¢  i do not know in whose hand writing this  w  marsh  esq   isÃ¢  it is not mineÃ¢  all my family have been liberated as well as myselfÃ¢  my object in giving my last statement was certainly to effect that purpose q  did you know allen  a clerk at  messrs  hartley s  a  no  i never saw him to my knowledgeÃ¢  i never had any acquaintance with any body of that nameÃ¢  i have no recollection of any such person living in my neighbourhoodÃ¢  i will swear i have no acquaintance of that nameÃ¢  i do not know a person named mitchellÃ¢  i have heard the nameÃ¢  i never had any acquaintance of that nameÃ¢  the hay that was found in the boxes was taken away by ellis caspar in his pocket handkerchief  and the wooden boxes were burntÃ¢  he did not appear to take great care of the hay q  why not suggest to him it would be better to burn it  a  theblaze might have set the chimney on fireÃ¢  i do not know that that reason was assigned  but it would have that effectÃ¢  there was a good large pocket handkerchief fullÃ¢  no means were attempted to burn itÃ¢  it might have been burnt certainly mr  clarkson  q  you have been asked whether you wrote the direction of no  3   william marsh  esq  Ã¢  did you know there was such a person in existence  a  i never heard of such a nameÃ¢  i never heard of a person named allen living near meÃ¢  i had not the most distant idea that mr  hartley had a servant or clerk of that nameÃ¢  i did not know any of the clerks or servants except the prisonerÃ¢  i read in the newspaper the decision of the judges on the last trialÃ¢  i went to mr  hartley in consequence of his sending his porterÃ¢  mr  hartley told me to call on mr  de mole  to see if he wanted meÃ¢  he sent me to mr  humphreys  who said he would send me a subpoena when i was wantedÃ¢  i have always been willing since the last trial to state what i knew of the transactionÃ¢  i do not know whether ellis caspar took away all the hay which was in the boxes  some might have been leftÃ¢  i was never charged with any offence in my life until this circumstanceÃ¢  i conducted mr  hyam s whole business for more than ten years  and am in his service nowÃ¢  davis is one of the persons indicted as isaac isaacsÃ¢  he has run away q  you have made a statement respecting the ore at his house in oxenden street  was that part of the statement you were prepared to make before davis ran away  a  certainly notÃ¢  i was to have screened himÃ¢  it was at his dictation i made the statement  to screen him  and when he found i made the statement before the magistrate which i did  he ran away q  what time on sunday  the 24th of march  was it that the two caspars came to your house  a  i have no doubt it was between one and two o clockÃ¢  that was the usual time i used to go home to dinner  and i met them in the streetÃ¢  none of my family were ever brought to trialÃ¢  i remember ellis caspar being in difficultiesÃ¢  i proved under his bankruptcy as a creditorÃ¢  i have the bill now in my pocketÃ¢  i dare say i had a dozen meetings with the caspars before the proposition to copy these forma was made to meÃ¢  there were several meetings at different timesÃ¢  the original proposition was about another parcel called stones court  q  you say you thought you were not doing wrong when you went to the office  when did you first have reason to know you were doing wrong  a  the same evening ellis caspar came to my house  and told me the nature of the business i had been engaged inÃ¢  he then told me there was gold in itÃ¢  i knew it was something intended to be kept secret  but i had no knowledge of it being a robberyÃ¢  i knew false papers were made out  and that i obtained the articles  in a false nameÃ¢  it was given to me by the prisoner s directionÃ¢  i knew i was lending myself to something not entirely correct  but supposing the prisoner to be a respectable young man  and knowing his father  i did not suppose a robbery was committed q  when you were shifting cabs  and taking things in an omnibus  and by false letters getting goods by false names  did not you know you were lending yourself to a false transaction  a  i did not get the letters milled upÃ¢  i carried a letter which was originally written by myself  but i had not read itÃ¢  it was folded  and i never opened it q  he came to the cab with you  and compared the letters  said therewas something wrong  showed the paper to you  told you to assume a false name  and to go and get the goods  a  i was not aware of it being a theft  however strange the circumstance may appearÃ¢  i mean to assert thatÃ¢  the prisoner told me i might depend on him  he would take all the blame if any body could blame him  as he was the principal in the concern  and i had nothing to fearÃ¢  i thought it was samething of smuggling  i admit  but further than that i did not thinkÃ¢  i knew it was gold the same night  ellis caspar told me so jury  q  you knew it was valuable property before  a  i never was given to understand so q  why put it in your bed room  a  because i had no mote convenient placeÃ¢  it was a very snail place i lived in  and the back parlour used by my wife was very smallÃ¢  i had no motive in carrying it up stairs but putting it out of the wayÃ¢  i have not said it was for security court  q  when you burnt the lid what did you think  a  then i knew all about it  i had been toldÃ¢  i have sot charged any person who had no share with me in the transactionÃ¢  my false statement were only to screen the guiltyÃ¢  that was mrs  abrahams and davisÃ¢  i have not falsely charged any one with the crimeÃ¢  i never made any but the present statement on oath henry mitchell  i am a messenger at mr  hartley s office is john street  on the 25th of march i saw the witness john vince with the city of limerick s ship s box  containing the papersÃ¢  i saw him lay it on the wash band standÃ¢  i saw the prisoner that morning about eight o clockÃ¢  he just walked through the warehouse into his own office as i supposed  and went out again  saying he would be in in a short timeÃ¢  i received the ship s box while he was outÃ¢  he came back and opened the box as it stood there  and took papers outÃ¢  he generally came to the office about nine o clock  but this morning he came about eightÃ¢  it might be a few minutes sooner or laterÃ¢  i went for the letters that morning to a receiving house in the minorie s  and got the letters  which i brought to the office and delivered to the clerk  william blundell  who took an account of them  about twenty minutes or a quarter to ten o clockÃ¢  he remained in the office  and took an account of the lettersÃ¢  the prisoner was standing at his desk at the same time  and took part of the letters out of blundell s handsÃ¢  i then went to breakfastÃ¢  both the prisoner and blundell stretched out their hands at the same time to receive the letters  but i gave then to blundell  and he opened themÃ¢  they were tied in a stringÃ¢  he was commencing to take the account  and while he was doing so  the prisoner took part of themÃ¢  i went to breakfast  leaving blundell taking the accountÃ¢  i returned at near ten o clock  and met the prisoner coming down stairsÃ¢  he sent me down to the wharf with a letter to give to mr  bristow  the wharfinger  and told me to tell mr  bristow  or any of the clerks there  not to let any of the specie off the wharf till he himself came downÃ¢  i went to the wharf but did not see mr  bristowÃ¢  i saw feltham and the foreman of the wharf  and delivered the messageÃ¢  i then returned to the prisonerÃ¢  i was sent down to the wharf againÃ¢  i then saw mr  bristow at the wharf  and delivered the former message to himÃ¢  i then returned to the prisoner  and found mossÃ¢   looking at him Ã¢  with him in the prisoner s office  which was the back roomÃ¢  they did not remain many minutes after i came inÃ¢  they both walked out of the back office through the warehouse  and went outÃ¢  moss got into a cabÃ¢  the prisoner remained behind  shut the door  and went to his room cross examined  q  is it not a common thing to send you down to thewharf with a message  a  yes  every dayÃ¢  i am there for the purposeÃ¢  i am not aware that he ever sent me with such a message before  not to let things go till he cameÃ¢  his orders were generally in writing  sometimes verbalÃ¢  he has not sent me with such messages before to my knowledgeÃ¢  i will not swear he has notÃ¢  he was there about eight o clock that morning  a few minutes before or afterÃ¢  it was before i had any thing but the office open and the floor sprinkled to be sweptÃ¢  seven o clock is the hour it opensÃ¢  i will swear he was there before nine o clock that morningÃ¢  there is a time piece in the office q  what is the earliest hour you have known him at the office  a  i have seen him between seven and eight o clock when a vessel has been sailing at six o clock  but that was very seldomÃ¢  i believe he has sometimes slept on board a vessel on such occasions  as i have taken notes to his mother s house on those occasionsÃ¢  i cannot say he slept on boardÃ¢  i have heard soÃ¢  he had his breakfast at the office those morningsÃ¢  he might have had his breakfast at the office on other mornings besides those on which vessels sailed  but put it altogether i do not suppose i have brought him half a dozen breakfasts since i have been thereÃ¢  i cannot say whether they were all shipping morningsÃ¢  i have been nearly eight years in the employÃ¢  i should say the prisoner has been in the office between two and three years  but at the time he joined the concern i belonged to the west end officeÃ¢  i should say we have both been in the same office about two yearsÃ¢  i am not aware thatÃ¢  he has breakfasted there with mr  hartleyÃ¢  he mightÃ¢  mr  hartley did sleep there sometimesÃ¢  i have not teen the prisoner breakfast with him q  who else was at the office that morning at eight o clock  a  the next clerk that came was allenÃ¢  he came about half past eight  as near as i can sayÃ¢  and another came  i should say  at nine o clockÃ¢  i believe that was mr  blundell  but i had gone for the letters about a quarter before nine  as there was a clerk in the placeÃ¢  it was a grocer s shop where i went to for the lettersÃ¢  the people generally meet there to get their lettersÃ¢  moss is the person who came to the office that morningÃ¢  i persist in swearing thatÃ¢  i gave a description of the person on the last trialÃ¢  i dare say i stated then that the man had sandy whiskersÃ¢  i didÃ¢  i said large bushy whiskers q  do you call moss a person with large bushy sandy whiskers  a  undoubtedly not at presentÃ¢  his whiskers are not in the same state as they were when he came to the officeÃ¢  i believe i described his whiskers as meeting close to the chinÃ¢  to the best of my opinion they were falseÃ¢  they were never the natural growth of his faceÃ¢  they were sandy at that time  to the best of my opinionÃ¢  i am not aware that i gave that description to roe and leaÃ¢  when brought to lambeth street i described them as i have nowÃ¢  i do not call them sandy nowÃ¢  i am not aware that i gave a description of the man to roe and leaÃ¢  i will not swear that i didÃ¢  i did not  to my knowledge  swear on the last trial that i had given a description to one of the officersÃ¢  to the best of my opinion  i did notÃ¢  i am not aware that i gave that description to one of the officers  but i will not swear to any thing i am not conscious ofÃ¢  i did not  to my knowledge  give any such description either to roe or leaÃ¢  i cannot answer in any other wayÃ¢  i cannot say what age the man who came to the office appeared to beÃ¢  he seemed to me to be a middle aged man  a man that had a halt in his walkÃ¢  as he walked out of the warehouse heappeared lameÃ¢  he walked in that wayÃ¢  i might have said  he appeared to be a man about sixty years of ageÃ¢  i do not think i said sixty on the last trialÃ¢  it is so long ago i might be wrong if i swore i did notÃ¢  to the best of my opinion  i did notÃ¢  i never  to my knowledge  described the man as appearing about sixty years of ageÃ¢  i only swear to the best of my opinion q  did he appear about sixty  a  he walked with his bead downÃ¢  it is hard to describe what age he might beÃ¢  i took him to be in the middle age of lifeÃ¢  i should say fifty was nearer the markÃ¢  when a man is sixty he is going down hillÃ¢  i did not take notice whether allen was in the office or not at the time the man came q  how soon after the robbery did allen leave mr  hartley s office  a  to the best of my opinion  he left on whit monday  seven weeks after the robberyÃ¢  i might have said on the last trial that he left a fortnight or three weeks after the robbery  but i have found out since if i did say so i have said wrongÃ¢  i remember seeing moss in custody at lambeth streetÃ¢  i do not know when moss was first taken  but i know allen was in mr  hartley s employ  and left about whit mondayÃ¢  i should say moss had been examined before thatÃ¢  allen did live in commercial road  but i rather think  about the time of the robbery he lived in a street opposite the wharf  burr street or somethingÃ¢  i cannot say when he moved thereÃ¢  i do not know what has become of himÃ¢  i have not heard whether he is living or deadÃ¢  i should say he left the office very suddenlyÃ¢  he was at business the saturday before  and did not make his appearance on mondayÃ¢  i have stated that he elopedÃ¢  those were the words i made use ofÃ¢  i did not notice whether the man who came to the office had a velvet collar to his coat or not  at the time i saw moss first he was leaning both his arms on the deskÃ¢  i had only a side glance at himÃ¢  i have not described him as having a velvet collar  to my knowledgeÃ¢  the prisoner superintended the business when mr  hartley was out of townÃ¢  as far as i have seen  he appeared very zealous and industriousÃ¢  i described the man as between five feet eight and nineÃ¢  i never described him as six feet high mr  doane  q  on the mornings when the prisoner occasionally came before nine o clock  it was when vessels were to sail early  a  those mornings in particularÃ¢  no vessel sailed early on the morning in questionÃ¢  there was no reason  that i know of  for his coming before nine o clock q  you are not sure whether allen was in the office when most came  can you say whether you are sure that most was with allen or with the prisoner  a  i swear the prisoner and moss were both together  and moss took the cab  and the prisoner waved  his hand to himÃ¢  i am positive moss is the man william blundell  on the 25th of march i was a clerk in mr  hartley s officeÃ¢  i was in the counting house that morning  when the general post letters were deliveredÃ¢  the prisoner was thereÃ¢  i received the letters a little before ten o clock from mitchellÃ¢  i keep a book  in which i enter the account of postageÃ¢  i have it with me nowÃ¢  i made an entry that morning in the book  and altered it after i made itÃ¢  the first entry was one falmouth  two plymouth  and four dublin letters  which  according to my reckoning  came to 7s  10d Ã¢  the prisoner took part of the letters from me  opened them  and returned them to me  and when he returned them to me there were two falmouth lettersÃ¢  the postage of aletter from falmouth  at that time  was 1s Ã¢  it was the custom of the postman to put the amount of the letters on the back of one of them  and he had done so that morningÃ¢  there was 1s  difference between his amount and mineÃ¢  that would be the difference of one falmouth letterÃ¢  i put down the amount of the letters in my book  after i received them from lewin caspar  and my account was 1s  more than the postman sÃ¢  the postman s entry on the letters was 1s  10d Ã¢  it if our custom to settle with the general postman once a weekÃ¢  when i paid him that week i paid him for one falmouth letterÃ¢  the letters were taken into the office that morning by lewin casparÃ¢  about eleven o clock that morning i was called out to see somebodyÃ¢  i went out  and saw a cab and a man in itÃ¢   looking at the witness moss Ã¢  that is the manÃ¢  he asked for mr  hartleyÃ¢  i told him that mr  hartley was not in town  but that mr  caspar  his agent  would see himÃ¢  i went in and called the prisonerÃ¢  he went out to the cab  and they both came through the outer office  and went into the inner officeÃ¢  they remained there a few minutesÃ¢  they both came out together  caspar opening the door for mossÃ¢  but before they came out the prisoner came from the inner office to me  and asked me whether there were two boxes of gold dust marked  b  c  18 and 19   consigned to the brazilian a companyÃ¢  i told him there wasÃ¢  i looked into the book to examine before i told himÃ¢  moss went away in the cabÃ¢  the prisoner went out of the office into the street with himÃ¢  i saw the prisoner again at two o clock that day  and he told me that a robbery had been committedÃ¢  he said nothing else that i am aware of  nothing about the letters that i am aware ofÃ¢  i cannot say that the word  forgery  was mentioned cross examined  q  it would be caspar s duty to open all letters that came there in the absence of mr  hartley  a  yesÃ¢  i received the letters from mitchellÃ¢  i entered part of them in the book immediatelyÃ¢  i bad entered part of them when caspar took some of them upÃ¢  i entered them all before he took them away into the back officeÃ¢  it was not after his return from the back office that i discovered there was an extra letter  it was while he was standing at the deskÃ¢  i was entering them when he took themÃ¢  i had entered one falmouth letter before he took them from meÃ¢  i suppose he saw me do itÃ¢  he was standing at the desk at the time  close to meÃ¢  he knew it was my custom to enter letters in the book as soon as they came q  when you received the letters back from caspar  and saw two falmouth letters instead of one  did you mention it to him  a  i told him there was 1s  difference in the postageÃ¢  i did not make any observation about the difference in the lettersÃ¢  i did not tell him there was one falmouth letter more than i had given to himÃ¢  i did not think it was requisiteÃ¢  i immediately made the alterationÃ¢  he did not say any thing particular when i told him there was 1s  difference in the lettersÃ¢  he had nothing to do with the payment of the pottage  any more than to see that it was correctÃ¢  i went to the office at nine o clock that morningÃ¢  several of the clerks were there when i got thereÃ¢  i believe francis allen was thereÃ¢  mitchell had gone for the lettersÃ¢  i paid the postman  at the end of the week  25s  6d   and 1s  10d  for that morning q  now you say moss is the person who came there  did he present the same appearance then that he does now  a  no  he had large black whiskers  not unusually largeÃ¢  they were large whiskersÃ¢  they were so large that they attracted my particular attentionÃ¢  very differentfrom what he appears nowÃ¢  i did not observe what age he appeared to be exactlyÃ¢  i am not aware that i have ever said he was a man of fifty or sixty years of ageÃ¢  i do not remember that i said on the last trial  he was a man between fifty and sixty years of ageÃ¢  i might have said so  but i cannot say  it is so long sinceÃ¢  i think i heard mitchell say he was about sixtyÃ¢  i cannot say whether i swore that at the last trial or notÃ¢  i believe i didÃ¢  the person stooped as he walked  i should say  from infirmity or ageÃ¢  i think i said  last time  that he was from five to six feet high  leaving plenty of room for guessingÃ¢  i did not say he was about five feet seven inchesÃ¢  caspar was not at the office when i got there at nine o clockÃ¢  it was after nine o clock when i first saw him that morningÃ¢  i cannot say whether it was as late as half pastÃ¢  i should say it was between nine and half past nine o clockÃ¢  nine o clock was my usual time for going to the officeÃ¢  i believe caspar very often went earlier than thatÃ¢  it was necessary for businessÃ¢  i have seen nothing of moss since  the last trial  only about here the last day or twoÃ¢  not at the office  or anywhere elseÃ¢  i am not aware of any mistakes in letters from correspondents at falmouth with regard to goods consignedÃ¢  mistakes have happenedÃ¢  goods have been entered on the manifest  and have not arrived  and letters hare occasionally been written to correct the errorsÃ¢  i have known letters from messrs  carne correcting errors made in previous communicationsÃ¢  that has sometimes happenedÃ¢  i do not know that it has not frequently happenedÃ¢  i have not been in the habit of reading the lettersÃ¢  i have heard of such things in the officeÃ¢  i think allen was in the office when i got there that morningÃ¢  i cannot say positivelyÃ¢  he remained in the office six or seven weeks i think afterwardsÃ¢  i do not exactly remember the time moss was taken into custodyÃ¢  i do not know that allen went off very suddenlyÃ¢  i know it was talked of that be ran away  that be went awayÃ¢  i think moss was taken about four or five weeks afterwardsÃ¢  i do not remember whether it was about the same time that allen leftÃ¢  i believe it wasÃ¢  i do not know that allen has run away to americaÃ¢  i do not know whether he it living or deadÃ¢  i have not heard q  were the papers in the office open as much to allen and the other clerks as they were to caspar  a  no  not private lettersÃ¢  letters of any importance were not open to any one who liked to read them q  but could not any other clerk in the office  if so disposed  read any of them  a  no  because they were always looked up  i believeÃ¢  i dare say i could have read them if they were lying aboutÃ¢  i cannot say where the keys were kept  unless caspar kept themÃ¢  i am not aware that they hung up in the officeÃ¢  i never knew of their being kept in the officeÃ¢  allen was collecting clerkÃ¢  he was occasionally in the habit of going on board steam vessels  and to the wharfÃ¢  there are two cupboards in the office  in which boxes of letters were keptÃ¢  letters received in the morning from correspondents would be put in the cupboardÃ¢  it was not locked Ã¢  i believe any clerk in the office could have gone and looked at themÃ¢  i have no doubt of it q  was it not matter of public talk and notoriety that allen had run away  a  not that i am aware ofÃ¢  it was talked of in the office that he had gone away  and had not been seen since  but not that he had run awayÃ¢  i am not aware that any inquiries have been made about himÃ¢  i have never seen him since mr  clarkson  q  whose business was it to take care of letters andsuperintend the business of the office in the absence of mr  hartley  a  caspar sÃ¢  it was his duty to take charge of letters  to read  and answer themÃ¢  no other person in the office had any right to read private communications made to mr  hartley but the prisonerÃ¢  i believe i was asked nearly all these questions about allen on the former trialÃ¢  there have been letters from messrs  came correcting communications of the delivery of goodsÃ¢  caspar would know that  and would know how the absence of goods might be accounted forÃ¢  i did not get to the office till nine o clockÃ¢  whether caspar was there before that  or what he had been doing between eight and nine o clock  i do not knowÃ¢  at the time i spoke to caspar about the postage  i had no idea that one of those letters was a forgery  nor that the post mark had been forged  or that any fraud had been committed or contemplatedÃ¢  i supposed it was a mistake of my own  and altered itÃ¢  allen went away about six or seven weeks after this transactionÃ¢  i do not know when moss was taken jury  q  on the 25th  when the letters arrived  was it possible that any one besides the prisoner could have seen them previous to the arrival of moss  a  if they were laid on the desk  and no one was in the office  any one could walk in and see themÃ¢  they did not lay there that i know of q  from the time you received the letters from mitchell till you saw moss there  was it possible for any one but the prisoner to see those letters  a  no court  q  what time did you see moss come  a  nearly eleven o clock  and the post arrived about a quarter before tenÃ¢  the prisoner was present when mitchell delivered the letters to meÃ¢  i delivered over to the prisoner all the letters i receivedÃ¢  several other clerks were in the office when mitchell delivered the letters to me  but nobody handled them but i and the prisonerÃ¢  he had taken some letters from me before i made the entry complete in the book thomas kingston  i am foreman at iron gate wharf  on the 25th of march  i remember a person coming there in a cab  about twelve o clockÃ¢   looking at moss Ã¢  that is the manÃ¢  he asked me if the agent was inÃ¢  i told him he was not in town  but the wharfinger was at homeÃ¢  he mentioned mr  bristow by name  and desired me to call him outÃ¢  i called him out  and he came out to him  went to the cab  and they spoke togetherÃ¢  moss then came out of the cab into the counting house with mr  bristowÃ¢  he was there about two minutes  and came outÃ¢  i brought out one box and another man another  by mr  bristow s desireÃ¢  mr  bristow told me to put those boxes into the cab  which i didÃ¢  they were marked  b  c  18 and 19 Ã¢  moss gave me a shilling and drove away in the cab with the two boxesÃ¢  i had seen the prisoner in the counting house that morning  about an hour before moss came cross examined  q  are you quite sure moss is the man  a  i am i have no doubt of it whateverÃ¢  i never said i had a doubtÃ¢  he had larger whiskers then  and he looks fatter now than he did then  in my opinionÃ¢  his whiskers were a size larger than now  as large as mineÃ¢  i call mine larger than his  middling sizedÃ¢  they were black  i am certain  quite blackÃ¢  i saw him next at lambeth street  about three weeks or a month afterwards  and i knew him at onceÃ¢  i knew allen very wellÃ¢  i did not see him in the course of that day  to my recollectionÃ¢  he ran away from mr  hartley sÃ¢  every body knew thatÃ¢  he ran away i believe  about the beginning of mayÃ¢  the  first time i saw moss at lambeth street was about april  i thinkÃ¢  i cannot say whether it was about the same time as allen ran awayÃ¢  it was not a great while edward bristow  i am chief clerk at iron gate wharf  on the 25th of march last i remember seeing the prisoner at the wharf  between ten and eleven o clock in the morningÃ¢  i was in the counting houseÃ¢  he brought a letter with himÃ¢   looking at no  3 Ã¢  this is itÃ¢  he threw it on the desk  and said he had received it that morning from messrs  carne  to deliver two boxes  marked  b c 18   19   to a gentleman who would produce a

him bow long he thought the gentleman would be before he cameÃ¢  he said he expected he would have been there before himÃ¢  i wished him to stay and see them deliveredÃ¢  i was aware they contained large property  by the statement on the manifest  which made me wish him to stopÃ¢  he said he would stayÃ¢  he remained about half an hourÃ¢  he then went away with other packages  which he had  to the bank of englandÃ¢  the expected gentleman came  i should think  rather more than half an hour after the prisoner leftÃ¢  kingston  the foreman  informed me of his arrivalÃ¢  i went out  found a cab there  and a person in itÃ¢  it was mossÃ¢  i saw the letter in his hand  with the order of the prisoner at the footÃ¢  he showed it to meÃ¢  this is itÃ¢   looking at no  4 Ã¢  i believe the

 was the prisoner  in the absence of mr  hartley  generally very much engaged in business  a  yesÃ¢  i do not consider that he had any time to throw awayÃ¢  i did not consider it extraordinary that he should go away after waiting half an hourÃ¢  he had the whole business to attend to in mr  hartley s absenceÃ¢  i first heard there had been a robbery about two o clock in the afternoonÃ¢  the prisoner was not the first person to tell meÃ¢  kingston didÃ¢  i saw the prisoner about three o clock in the afternoon  he then told me of itÃ¢  i was examined at lambeth street q  from first to last did not the prisoner evince every anxiety to exert himself to the utmost to discover the perpetrators of the robbery  a  he certainly appeared very much excited about itÃ¢  he expressed himself anxious that the perpetrators should be brought to justiceÃ¢  he never absented himself from the office to my knowledgeÃ¢  i have known him about four yearsÃ¢  i never heard any thing but the highest character of himÃ¢  he was always considered clever in businessÃ¢  i do not know that mistakes were occasionally made at the officeÃ¢  my duty is at the wharfÃ¢  i have known some packages over  which were not in the manifest  and some packages in the manifest  not in the vessel q  in different matters were there not mistakes occurring almost every day of some sort or other  a  there might be slight errorsÃ¢  i never heard of any serious onesÃ¢  i was shown this letter  no  4  by the prisoner  in lea s presence  on the afternoon the robbery was committedÃ¢  i believed the signature of messrs  came to it  to be genuineÃ¢  i have seen messrs  carne s signature occasionally  and believed it to be genuine q  have you known the prisoner very often at the wharf early of a morning  a  no  not very earlyÃ¢  i have seen him there at eight o clock when he had occasion to go on board a vessel that was going to sail  but not on other occasionsÃ¢  i never recollect itÃ¢  i will undertake to say i never did see him unless a vessel was sailingÃ¢  i have seen him at the office as early as eight o clock q  is that the sort of direction the prisoner would write as an order to deliver goods  a  yes  when he had occasion to do soÃ¢  i should have delivered a package without the order under it  but not such valuable propertyÃ¢  if i saw the letter  believing it to be  signed by messrs  carne  i should have delivered itÃ¢  believing it to be genuine  i should have delivered the goodsÃ¢  i knew allenÃ¢  i did not see him at the wharf that day  i am certainÃ¢  he might be at the wharf once or twice a weekÃ¢  i remember his leaving suddenlyÃ¢  i do not know why he left  nor whether he is living or deadÃ¢  i have never seen him sinceÃ¢  i have never had any doubt about moss being the person who came to the wharfÃ¢  i did not hear mitchell describe himÃ¢  i remember bills being put up advertising the robberyÃ¢  communications from falmouth of consignments would be by post advising of them q  did such advice generally arrive the day before the goods  a  it depended on the passage the vessel hadÃ¢  this vessel left  i think  in time to be up on sunday  but the letters could not be delivered until mondayÃ¢  nobody in mr  hartley s establishment could know that the gold was comingÃ¢  the writing of this letter   no  4   is different to any writing i ever saw from messrs  carne s office  except the signatureÃ¢  it is very different to the prisoner s hand writingÃ¢  i should not consider any part of it like his  except the order and endorsement mr  bodkin  q  you remember the prisoner at the wharf at eight o clock  when vessels have been startingÃ¢  were any starting this morning  a  noÃ¢  these boxes corresponded in every respect with the manifest william debonnaire haggard  i am chief clerk in the bullion office at the bank of england  on the 25th of march i did not receive two boxes of gold dustÃ¢  i expected two  from a letter i received from falmouth for the brazilian company james peat  i am accountant to the brazilian company  i went to the office of the company on the 25th of march  about ten o clockÃ¢  no boxes of gold dust marked b c 18 and 19 arrived at the officeÃ¢  we expected such boxesÃ¢  william march is our secretaryÃ¢  he came to the office about eleven o clockÃ¢  in consequence of a communication from him  i sent carthew to the dublin steam packet wharfÃ¢  i was at the bullion office in the bank about one o clock  when the prisoner came thereÃ¢  i went to inquire if the boxes had arrived  and saw the prisoner thereÃ¢  i asked him what had become of oar two boxes of gold dust  marked b c 18 and 19Ã¢  he said   they have been delivered at your house Ã¢  i said   how is that  when they are consigned by the bill of lading to the bank of england  Ã¢  he said   we have this morning received a letter from messrs  carne  stating  that in consequence of an error in the manifest  they were not to be delivered at the bank of england  but to the agent of the brazilian company Ã¢  i asked him the name of the agentÃ¢  he said he could not recollect  but if i would go with him to the office  in crutched friars  he would tell me the nameÃ¢  i asked him if the name was marchÃ¢  he said   that  i think  is the name Ã¢  i then left the bank  and left himÃ¢  i went to our office  and ascertained that the boxes were not delivered thereÃ¢  i then went to the office in crutched friars  and saw the prisoner in the outer officeÃ¢  i said   these boxes have not been delivered at our office  where are they  Ã¢  he said   if you will walk into the inner office  i will tell you what has become of them Ã¢  he produced two letters to meÃ¢   looking at nos  3 and 4 Ã¢  these are thenÃ¢  no  4 was exactly in the same state then as it is now  with the address torn offÃ¢  i asked him   what has become of the outside of this letter  the address  Ã¢  he said   i don t know whether it was torn off when it was first delivered into my hands  or whether it was torn off since Ã¢  he did not tell me whether he knew who it had been addressed toÃ¢  he asked me if i thought the signatures of messrs  carne were genuineÃ¢  i told him i thought notÃ¢  he said   are they not like messrs  carnes  writing  Ã¢  i said   certainly  i think they are like it  but i think they are not genuine  i think they are forged Ã¢  i asked him if the body of the letter was written in a similar hand to any body in messrs  carnes  house that he was in the habit of seeingÃ¢  if it was similar to any writing he had seen coming from messrs  carnes  houseÃ¢  he said  certainly it was  he had seen such writing oftenÃ¢  he did not tell me whose writing it was cross examined  q  did you ask him if the boxes had been delivered  a  he told roe they had been delivered that morning to a gentlemanly looking man  either representing himself as coming from william march  or william march himself  he could not tell whichÃ¢  he said he thought the letters genuine  and he had seen similar writing from carnes  houseÃ¢  i am acquainted with messrs  carnes  writingÃ¢  it is in some degree similarÃ¢  i mean the signature  but  in my opinion  easily detected to be a forgery q  suppose a person received it in the hurry of business  do not you think he might be deceived by it  a  it is possibleÃ¢   looking at no  3 Ã¢  there is nothing particularly extraordinary in this letterÃ¢  i should say  on looking at it  it is not what i consider exactly a mercantile letterÃ¢  in the first place  it is addressed at foot  w  marsh  esq   agent to the brazilian mining company  or order   now mr  march s name is spelt wrong  and he is not agent  but secretary to the companyÃ¢   looking at no  4 Ã¢  this is decidedly much more unmercantile than the other  because it is addressed  messrs  w  marsh  esqr  Ã¢  the signature is somewhat similar to messrs  carnes Ã¢  it is a signature i would not act on q  but a person reading it over once may very likely not be able to distinguish it from a genuine signature  a  it is possible  i cannot say it is probable i confessÃ¢  i am not at all acquainted with the hand writing of the prisonerÃ¢  i should say the note at the bottom of no  8  is a different hand writing from the body  and the date also   23rd of march  1839  i should say was differentÃ¢  all the rest appears to be one hand writing  except the note at the bottom  and the signatureÃ¢  i do not think the date is a similar hand writing to the body  generallyÃ¢  i think it is a different hand writingÃ¢  i think the date of no  4  and  messrs  w  marsh  esq   secretary to the brazilian mining company  or order   is different to the body q  in your judgment  could such an error as that be made by a person competent to conduct mr  hartley s business  a  certainly notÃ¢  nor any person in the habit of correspondingÃ¢   messrs   is in the same line with the name  and appears in the same hand writing as the rest of the address  and it appears to be squeezed into a place not large enough mr  clarkson  q  look at the words   city of limerick  tell me whether that is the same hand writing as the body  a  i think notÃ¢  i think the  18 and 19  appear the same kind of figures as the date  1839  q  can you perceive any difference in the writing and ink of the word  messrs    in the corner  and the name which follows  a  it appears to me it is all written with the same inkÃ¢  the word  messrs   is written rather larger than the rest of the nameÃ¢  it is the same as  w  marsh   c   in my opinion william march  i am secretary to the brazilian company  mr  george haythorn is one of the proprietors of that companyÃ¢  there are other proprietors besides himÃ¢  on the 20th of march we had advice of the arrival of some gold dust from the brazils  by a letter from messrs  carne  of falmouthÃ¢  it was advice of two boxes of gold dust   18 and 19   weighing 102 lbs  10oz  11 dwts   by the sea gull  they were forwarded by the city of limerick steam packet q  when would it be known in london among persons conversant with shipping  that the sea gull had arrived  a  on the 20th  the day we received the adviceÃ¢  on the 25th of march i received further advice of their being shipped  by the city of limerick steamerÃ¢  a bill of lading was enclosed with the advice  which i thought i had here  but i find i have made a mistake  and brought the wrong oneÃ¢  i never authorised moss  or any other person to go to iron gate wharf  to receive those boxesÃ¢  i had no idea of such a proceeding being taken  no  1   being read  was the bill of lading of the city of limerick  in which was  two boxes of gold dust  marked b  c  18 and 19   containing together 1021bs  10oz  11 dwts  troy

received the chest of tea  which shall be returned  mr  bristow  please attend to this Ã¢  l  caspar  william marchcontinued  i never saw this letter  no  4   till after the robbery was effectedÃ¢  that is not written at all in a mercantile style  quite unbusiness like q  would you  as a man of business  act on the receipt of that letter  a  certainly not  not purporting to come from a respectable house like carnes Ã¢  this letter  no  3   is not  in my judgment  a mercantile business like letterÃ¢  a person conversant with mercantile affairs would not act on such a letter  i should sayÃ¢  it is not quite so informal as the other  but my name is improperly spelt  and the firm it mentioned in the body of the letter  and at the bottom it says   w  marsh  esq   agent Ã¢  messrs  carne are aware of the way to spell my name  and are constantly in the habit of writing to me  and they know i am not agent to the company  but secretary cross examined  q  you received the first intimation of the consignment of gold dust on the 20th of march  a  yesÃ¢  i did not make that communication publicÃ¢  it does not go beyond the directors of our own company  and persons connected with the companyÃ¢  i might mention it to themÃ¢  i had no communication with the prisoner on the subject  nor with any body in mr  hartley s office q  although it would be known to shipping people on the 20th  that the sea gull had arrived  would it be known to them what the cargo consisted of  a  it is very likelyÃ¢  it is often mentioned in the newspaper if there is specie on board q  in your judgment  would any one conversant with mercantile matters  intending to commit a fraud  write such letters as these  a  it is difficult to say  a person well acquainted with business  i should say  hardly wouldÃ¢  i did not know the prisoner before this  the record of the conviction of moss was here produced and read   adjourned  saturday  march 7th  1840 james hartley  i carry on the business of a wharfinger and proprietor of steam vessels  with others  under the firm of james hartley and co   i am the prosecutor of this indictment  on the 25th of march i was in dublinÃ¢  i came to london on the night of the 28thÃ¢  the prisoner was in my service  and had at the rate of 150l  a yearÃ¢  in february  last year  he applied to me for an increase of salary  which i declinedÃ¢  on the 21st of march  last year  i had occasion to write to the prisonerÃ¢  this is the letter i wrote to him  no  7 Ã¢  this letter of the 26th of march  no  5  is in the prisoner s hand writingÃ¢  that letter was never sentÃ¢  allen was in my employÃ¢  he quitted my employ on the 13th of may lastÃ¢  moss was taken into custody about the middle of aprilÃ¢  i have not the most remote reason to believe that allen was concerned in this transaction cross examined  q  he was a clerk in your employ  the same as the prisoner  but in a subordinate situation  a  yesÃ¢  he had a salary as the restÃ¢  i had no notice whatever of his going awayÃ¢  the last i saw of him was on saturday evening  when i sent him to the bank with lodgmentsÃ¢  i have not seen him sinceÃ¢  i have heard from his brother that he went to montreal  and is deadÃ¢  i did not learn when he wentÃ¢  i could have his brother here in a few minutesÃ¢  i had the highest opinion of the prisoner s integrity  or i would not have left my business in his handsÃ¢  a good deal of specie came to the bank  which he had to superintend the delivery of q  there was at one time 90 000  at another 10 000 guineas in one parcel  a  i do not recollect that  but very large sums passed through his handsÃ¢  moss surrendered himself in aprilÃ¢  allen lodged in burr street  lower east smithfield  the latter part of the time he was with meÃ¢  i do not know whether he lived in commercial road before thatÃ¢  i do not know whether the prisoner was in the habit of sleeping on board vessels at timesÃ¢  i have seen him at my office early on shipping mornings  between seven and eight o clockÃ¢  i think he might be there on other mornings sometimes as early as eight o clock mr  clarkson  q  allen filled quite a subordinate situation to the prisoner  a  yesÃ¢  he had nothing to do with the letters or giving orders about bills of lading  or any thing  till they had gone through the prisoner s hands george carthew  i am in the service of the brazilian company  on the 25th of march  last year  i was sent to mr  hartley s office  in john street  and saw a clerk thereÃ¢  i believe the prisoner to be the person  but i cannot swear to himÃ¢  i inquired if two boxes of gold dust had arrived by their vessel  from falmouth  on the brazilian company s accountÃ¢  he answered   yes Ã¢  this was about eleven o clock in the morningÃ¢  mr  peat had sent meÃ¢  i should think it was rather after eleven o clock than beforeÃ¢  i think i might be certain it was before twelve o clockÃ¢  i asked if two boxes bad arrived marked  b  c   and i think the numbers were  18 and 19 Ã¢  i mentioned that to himÃ¢  he said they had arrivedÃ¢  i then asked him if he could inform me what time they would arrive as the bank of englandÃ¢  he said   they are about arriving there at this time Ã¢  i believe there was a second person thereÃ¢  the porter  who waited in the office when the clerks were not thereÃ¢  it was not kingstonÃ¢  i have seen him here to dayÃ¢  i think it was mitchell cross examined  q  you were examined on the last trial  a  yesÃ¢  to the best of my knowledge  the prisoner is the person i sawÃ¢  i do not swear he is the person q  will you swear that you believe he is the man  a  no court  q  do you understand the question you have said you believed you saw the prisoner  do you mean you do not mean to represent your belief that he is the man  a  i believe he is the man  but i cannot swear it mr  jones  q  do you mean to swear you believe he is the man  a  yes  that is my beliefÃ¢  i cannot swear positivelyÃ¢  i swear i believe he is the manÃ¢  i remember being examined on the last trial upon this point q  did you not swear on that occasion that you did not see any one in court that you saw on that occasion  looking at the prisoner  a  i hadnot caught sight of him thenÃ¢  i did swear that  but it was before i had seen the prisonerÃ¢  never having been in a court before  i looked all round and did not see the prisonerÃ¢  i said on the last trial that i would not undertake to swear to him by any means q  did you say a word on the last trial about asking the person you saw there when the boxes would be taken to the bank of england  a  yes  that i didÃ¢  i swear that court  q  you are not asked whether the fact passed  but whether you stated on the former trial that you put the question to the prisoner what time they would arrive at the bank of england  a  i certainly gave that statement here  i am confident cross examined bymr  jones  q  do you mean to swear you said so on the last trial  a  i believe i repeated it as near as possible in the same words i have nowÃ¢  i certainly answered the question  and in the same words i think as i have stated nowÃ¢  i asked him if he could inform me what time they would arrive at the bank  and he said   they are arriving about this time Ã¢  i stated that at the last trialÃ¢  i will swear thatÃ¢  i believe i gave that in a confused way  and i was stoppedÃ¢  i was giving the two sentences together and i was stopped  and whether i gave it a second time or not i cannot swearÃ¢  i should think it was as early at one o clock in the afternoon that i went thereÃ¢  i will not be positive whether it was or notÃ¢  i know it was about the middle of the day jury  q  had you ever been to mr  hartley s office before the 25th of march  a  many timesÃ¢  i do not recollect ever seeing the prisoner there on the different occasions henry mossre examined bymr  clarkson  q  i forgot to ask you yesterday whether in the course of your conversations with the prisoner any thing passed on the subject of a letter received from mr  hartley  a  on sunday  the 24th of march  the prisoner was at my house with his father  and the prisoner showed me a letter he had received from dublinÃ¢  i mentioned that at the police office before the letter was shown to meÃ¢  the subject of that letter was a complaint of his not having acknowledged the receipt of 300l Ã¢  i have no doubt this is the letter  no  7   this letter being read in part  was dated dublin  21st march  and was as follows  Ã¢   dear sir  this day week i sent you an order for 300l   to be lodged on my credit at williams and co  s  and you have not to this day acknowledged the receipt    c jury  q  in the different statements you have made concerning this transaction  did you always make the same statement with respect to the share  the prisoner had in the transaction  a  precisely toÃ¢  i have always attributed to him the same share in the transaction cross examined  q  i think you say you made three different statements  a  i think 1 didÃ¢  i am confident i mentioned the prisoner s name in the first statementÃ¢  i gave that statement to davis  who took it from me and took it somewhereÃ¢  i am quite confident i have always mentioned the prisoner to be in the situation i have placed him at the present timeÃ¢  i swear his name was mentioned in the statement davis took awayÃ¢  it must have been after nine o clock  or about nine o clock  that i saw ellis caspar in my parlour on monday night  the 25th of marchÃ¢  rather after than beforeÃ¢  i was fetched from the public house to him by my servantÃ¢  i could not have sworn on the last trial that it was eight o clock q  perhaps you have found out since that lea swore he did not leave ellis caspar till nine o clock  a  no john roe  i am an officer of the city  my assistance was called in on the 26th of march last respecting thisÃ¢  after being at the office of mr  hartley  i went to st  paul s coffee house  and saw the prisoner thereÃ¢  he came while i was thereÃ¢  i asked him if he had the two letters with him  the one purporting to come from falmouth  and the other from marsh and co  of broad streetÃ¢  his answer was  yes  he had  and be then produced them to meÃ¢  these are them  nos  3 and 4 Ã¢  no  4 was just in the same state as it is now  with the back torn off  but the letters  er  leftÃ¢  i said  i suppose you know to whom this was addressed  Ã¢  he said  no  i do not Ã¢  i said   was it in that state when it was delivered to you by the gentleman  Ã¢  he said he could not say whether it was torn off before or since  all he had to look at was to see whether the signature was a genuine one  and which he believed it wasÃ¢  on the 1st of april following  in consequence of information i received  i went to new street  whitechapel roadÃ¢  i found a house there without any body in itÃ¢  i went from there to mansel street to the witness mossÃ¢  i had not communicated to either of the caspars that i was going to mansel streetÃ¢  as far as i know they had no means of knowing what i was aboutÃ¢  while i was in mansel street i saw the prisoner and his father both within thirty or forty yards of the houseÃ¢  they were merely coming down the street when i first saw them  and they immediately turned round again and went awayÃ¢  mr  hartley was with meÃ¢  we overtook them  and mr  hartley asked the prisoner what he did thereÃ¢   at that time we knew nothing against old caspar Ã¢  his answer was he understood we had searched a house and found the gold  and he had come there to satisfy himselfÃ¢  he did not say who told him so  nor point out the houseÃ¢  he said he understood we had searched court  q  he did not describe what street  or what place  a  no  but gave that as his reason for being in that street mr  clarkson  q  do you remember seeing the prisoner and having conversation with him about his knowledge of moss  a  yes  that was the next dayÃ¢  i had not found any thing at that timeÃ¢  i had searched moss s lodging on the morning i saw him in mansel street  but found nothingÃ¢  on the following afternoon  about four o clock  i saw the prisoner in john street  and asked him if he knew a person of the name of mossÃ¢  he said   yes  i do  two or three  one was my father s foreman once Ã¢  i said   where does he live  Ã¢  he said   i don t know Ã¢  i said   when did you see him last  Ã¢  he said   about seven months ago Ã¢  i said   what was your business with him then  Ã¢  he said   i merely met him by accident  and asked him how he did Ã¢  upon his giving that account  mr  hartley gave him into my custodyÃ¢  that was on the 2nd of aprilÃ¢  moss surrendered himself to me about the middle of aprilÃ¢  i have possession of a handkerchief  which i produced yesterdayÃ¢  i got it from a man named fiestell jonas couter  i am a letter carrier in the general post officeÃ¢  mr  hartley s office  in john street  is in my delivery  and was so in march last yearÃ¢  i have an account of letters delivered for mr  hartley on the 25th of marchÃ¢  the amount of the letters delivered that day was 7s  10d Ã¢  i only keep an account of the unpaid letters cross examined  q  were there any paid letters  do you know  a  i cannot recollect  there might have beenÃ¢  i have been in the habit of delivering letters at mr  hartley s office nearly five yearsÃ¢  there have some timesbeen disputes and mistakes  but i always stuck to my bookÃ¢  i was right and they wrong mr  clarkson  q  have you ever had complaints that you made a mistake against yourself  in not having charged enough  a  no  i think notÃ¢  this would be against myself william davis  i am an inland messenger of the general post office  there is a circular stamp kept at the general post office  with which all unpaid letters are stampedÃ¢  the bags  on the 25th of march  were divided into eight divisionsÃ¢  each division was stamped with a particular letterÃ¢  there were four stamps for each of the seven divisions  and one for the eighth  which is an auxiliary divisionÃ¢   looking at the post mark on letter no  3 Ã¢  this stamp i do not consider the office stampÃ¢  it is not the genuine stamp of the officeÃ¢  it is the london mark  e  m  r  25 Ã¢  39  Ã¢  from the appearance of that stamp  that letter could not have come through the general post officeÃ¢   looking at no  4 Ã¢  this is not the genuine london stampÃ¢  that could not have come through the general post officeÃ¢  it would not get such a stamp by coming through the postÃ¢   looking at no  2 Ã¢  this is the genuine london post stampÃ¢  the form of the letters and the figures on the stamps on nos  3 and 4 have been imitatedÃ¢  i have the genuine stamp with me  but there has been an alteration as regards the date  from  39  to  40 Ã¢  we change them yearlyÃ¢  the circle of the letter  e  is the sameÃ¢  the genuine stamp of the day and year was produced on the last trial  but since that the  39  has been altered to  40 Ã¢  the letter  e  is a fixture  and the figures  18  in the circleÃ¢  the same type is used for m  r  this year as in 39Ã¢  here is an impression  taken in a book on that day before the duty commencesÃ¢   producing it Ã¢  all  the genuine impressions would exactly correspond with this cross examined  q  did you stamp letters on the 25th of march  a  i did notÃ¢  the book is signed by atkinsonÃ¢  i should think these stamps would be calculated to deceive an ordinary eye  but would be detected by the experienced eye of a post office clerk jane bradley  on the 25th of march  last year  i lived with the witness moss as his servant  and had done to about two yearsÃ¢  he lived in new street  just by the london hospital  all the time i was with himÃ¢  he went out in a working dress when he went to work in a morningÃ¢  that was generally the case  except on sundaysÃ¢  on monday  the 25th of march  he went out about half past eight o clock in the morning  as near as i can recollectÃ¢  he was dressed in his best clothesÃ¢  he returned between one and two o clock  as dear as i can recollectÃ¢  i heard a knock at the doorÃ¢  it was one knockÃ¢  he usually gave a double knockÃ¢  mistress opened the door to himÃ¢  i heard him say when he was let in   where is the girl  Ã¢  he usually dined between one and two o clockÃ¢  he did not stop to dinner that dayÃ¢  he did not remain long before he went out again  i think  about half an hour  as near as i can recollect  but i cannot recollectÃ¢  he came back again directly  and asked for his handkerchiefÃ¢  mistress brought him down two handkerchiefs  and i gave them to himÃ¢  one was a kind of red one  i forget the colour of the otherÃ¢  he came back in the evening  i think  about eight o clock  as near as i can guess  and had his teaÃ¢  he then washed himself  put on his common coat  the coat he went to work in  and went outÃ¢  i cannot say at what time he went outÃ¢  while he was out  ellis caspar called at my master s house  and i went to the earl st  vincent public house to fetch my masterÃ¢  i knew i should findhim thereÃ¢  he came back with meÃ¢  ellis caspar was still thereÃ¢  i did not sleep in the houseÃ¢  i think i left about eleven o clock that nightÃ¢  ellis caspar was there still in the house with masterÃ¢  i returned next morning  i think  about half past six o clockÃ¢  it was my duty to light the fireÃ¢  the fire place looked very dirty  and was all over white ashesÃ¢  it seemed to be the ashes of woodÃ¢  there were some nails mixed with them  and the hob had red sealing wax on itÃ¢  my master was in bed when i got thereÃ¢  my mistress went out directly after i got thereÃ¢  my master came down soon after  about half an hour after mistress went out  between seven and eight o clock  i believeÃ¢  he went out after dinnerÃ¢  he dined about one o clockÃ¢  i do not recollect that he went out from seven o clock in the morning till one o clockÃ¢  he went out about half an hour or an hour after dinnerÃ¢  i found lodgings were taken in mansel street  which is about a mile from new streetÃ¢  i packed up  to take the things awayÃ¢  there was a box  secured with a ropeÃ¢  it was mr  moss s daughter s boxÃ¢  it appeared very heavyÃ¢  i saw it taken away in a truckÃ¢  we went to the new lodging in mansel street on the tuesday night cross examined  q  were you taken up on this matter  a  yesÃ¢  i was kept under lea s care  at the flying horse public houseÃ¢  i do not live with moss nowÃ¢  i have learnt a businessÃ¢  i was at home on sunday  the 24th of march  at moss s house  all dayÃ¢  i had my meals thereÃ¢  they dined about one o clock on sundaysÃ¢  that was the usual hour  sometimes laterÃ¢  it might be a little after one o clock  because he came home from workÃ¢  he used to work on sundayÃ¢  he went out to work that sunday  about nine o clock  and came home about one o clock  or a little afterÃ¢  he came home by himselfÃ¢  i did not see any body with himÃ¢  nobody came to dinner that dayÃ¢  ellis caspar came while they were having dinnerÃ¢  he was in the front parlourÃ¢  i did not see any more persons come that dayÃ¢  i did not see him come with my masterÃ¢  i think he came while he was at dinner  and went into the parlourÃ¢  then moss went and spoke to him  and then he went home  and moss went to his workÃ¢  i do not recollect whether i opened the door to himÃ¢  i saw him thereÃ¢  i think he remained about half an hourÃ¢  i was in the back parlour q  and he in the front parlour  with your master and mistress  a  mistress was not thereÃ¢  i opened the room door  i think  and let him inÃ¢  i told master mr  caspar wanted him  and ellis caspar went into the front parlourÃ¢  i do not recollect going into that parlour while he remained there q  can you tell whether any body except your master and ellis caspar was in the parlour  a  no  i cannot  but there was somebody else there at nightÃ¢  i do not recollect any body else

went outÃ¢  he had gone  it might be about half an hour  when ellis caspar cameÃ¢  the earl st  vincent public house is not a great way from the houseÃ¢  it would take me five or ten minutes to walk thereÃ¢  my master came with me  and found ellis caspar at his house when we got there q  did you notice what time ellis caspar came to your master s house that night  a  i think it was about nine o clock  or a little afterÃ¢  i thinkit was as much as that  but i cannot exactly sayÃ¢  i think it was about nine o clockÃ¢  the earl st  vincent public house is not within three or four doors of the houseÃ¢  it is not in the same street  you turn down a street  and then down another streetÃ¢  it is at the back of the hospital q  do you remember at any time  after this business  being in a hackney

kingston Ã¢  that is the manÃ¢  he came to the cab doorÃ¢  moss remained in the cab some timeÃ¢  the porter fetched a gentlemanÃ¢   looking at mr  bristow Ã¢  that is the gentle manÃ¢  moss showed him a bill or letterÃ¢  he then went out of the cab into the wharfÃ¢  he was followed out of the wharf by a man who put two boxes into the cabÃ¢  there was some red wax on thenÃ¢  moss had a blue bagÃ¢  i gave one of the porters a four penny piece  by his directionÃ¢  i do not recollect whether he gave the porter any thingÃ¢  i think he gave kingston a shillingÃ¢  i drove him to the cross keys public

meÃ¢  i believe i answered   yes Ã¢  the same person asked if i could inform him what time they would arrive at the bank  and i think the answer i gave was   they are there by this time  q  how did you know any thing about it  a  i knew they would be landed about ten o clock  and by that time they would arrive at the bank of englandÃ¢  i knew they were expected by the manifest bookÃ¢  i had copied the manifest into the book mr  clarkson  q  were there several inquiries made about the boxes  a  no  i believe not george sheen  i helped to move moss s goods from new street to mansel

cheque   no  9  lucy marshall  i am a widow  i lived opposite moss s house in new streetÃ¢  i knew his person well  on monday  the 25th of march last  i saw him go into his house  about three o clock  or between three and four o clockÃ¢  i observed he had something very weighty with himÃ¢  he used to have a plate with his name on the door  and next morning i observed that the plate was taken offÃ¢  i saw the goods being moved away that dayÃ¢  a box  was shown to me at the last trialÃ¢  i saw a box like that moved out adolphus fieldstell  in march last  and before that  i kept a coffee shop in great tower street  i have known the prisoner a long timeÃ¢  i was not acquainted with moss at that timeÃ¢  i remember the prisoner coming to my coffee shopÃ¢  it must have been before marchÃ¢  i think in january  at the end of januaryÃ¢  there was a gentleman with him  but i cannot recollect himÃ¢  they had coffee thereÃ¢  after they were gone i found a pocket handkerchiefÃ¢   looking at the one produced by roe Ã¢  i believe this is the handkerchiefÃ¢  i had known the prisoner a very long timeÃ¢  he had never been to my coffee shop before  to my knowledgeÃ¢  i am certain of his having been there on that occasionÃ¢  i believe this to be the handkerchief  but i gave it directly to my wife  and did not examine it so accuratelyÃ¢  i had it back from her afterwards  and delivered it up at the police office  to lea or roeÃ¢   looking at roe Ã¢  that is the gentlemanÃ¢  i gave him the same handkerchief as i picked up that day cross examined  q  had you ever seen the prisoner at your shop before  a  not to my knowledgeÃ¢  i have known him from a childÃ¢  i did not know moss at allÃ¢  i cannot swear to his personÃ¢  he might have been at my coffee shopÃ¢  there may be a hundred people in my house at a timeÃ¢  i swear i do not recollect mossÃ¢  i have never seen him at my coffee house since to my knowledge  and i do not swear it was him with the prisonerÃ¢  i found the handkerchief  and gave it to my wile instantlyÃ¢  i do not believe any one was in the room when i found it  because it was about six o clock  when they went away  and i went up stairs to see if any body had left any thing  and found the handkerchiefÃ¢  i took it down to my wife instantlyÃ¢  it was about half past six or seven o clock in the evening when i found it  to the best of my recollectionÃ¢  i had a waiter at that time who was my wife s brotherÃ¢  i solemnly declare he was not present when i found itÃ¢  i knew where the prisoner s father lived at that timeÃ¢  i found the handkerchief in the place where the prisoner and the other had sat q  did you take any pains to inform the prisoner you had found it  a  i did not see him afterwards  but i left it  saying  should mr  caspar call  for the handkerchief to be returnedÃ¢  i did not send to him  because i did not know who had lost it  the prisoner or his companionÃ¢  i believed one of them had  but many other people came to the house q  why not send to the prisoner to say you had it  a  i did not know whether the prisoner would not come back to ask for itÃ¢  i should not have kept it if it had not been inquired forÃ¢  it is in possession of the officerÃ¢  i kept it five  six  or seven weeksÃ¢  i did not know where the prisoner lived  and if i had  i expected he might have called again  and that might have been another 1s  in my pocketÃ¢  i have never had any communication with moss since that time q  do you mean to swear you saw that handkerchief for the first time on the day the prisoner was at your shop  a  i can swear positively  i believe it is the handkerchief i found at the time the prisoner was at my house  but i will not positively swear it is the handkerchief until my wife identifies it court  q  the question is  whether you found it on the day the prisoner was at your house  a  yes  i did mr  jones  q  do you know davis  a  a little jew has called at my house  i believe  onceÃ¢  i swear solemnly that i did not know he was moss s stepfatherÃ¢  i heard afterwards that he wasÃ¢  i saw davisÃ¢  i do not know where he livedÃ¢  he did not tell meÃ¢  he came with another personÃ¢  i have not received 15l  from davis since this transactionÃ¢  i received 2l  from him at the time he came to my house with a person named mrs  abrahamsÃ¢  i mean the mrs  abrahams who was triedÃ¢  they came to my shop a few days after the prisoners were taken upÃ¢  the handkerchief was produced to themÃ¢  they did not ask for itÃ¢  they came while i was out  and applied to my wife  and she showed it to themÃ¢  i saw them when i came home q  what did you receive the 2l  for  a  i did not know davi s at all  but mrs  abrahams came to me  and said   do you know caspar  Ã¢  i said   yes Ã¢  she said   how long is it since you have seen him  Ã¢  i said   about two months ago  q  on what account did you receive the 2l   a  i must tell you what forÃ¢  he did not owe me any moneyÃ¢  i did not know himÃ¢  he gave me the moneyÃ¢  he made me a present of itÃ¢  i had seen davis before  but not known himÃ¢  i never had any previous transaction with him q  now  why did he give it you  a  mrs  abrahams called on me with him  and i knew mrs  abrahams very wellÃ¢  she said   mr  fiestell  do you know the name of caspar  Ã¢  i said   yes Ã¢  she said   do you know the gentleman who was with him  can you recollect him  Ã¢  i said   no Ã¢  she said   don t you know mr  moss  Ã¢  i said i did notÃ¢  she said   suppose i tell you how he looks  so and so Ã¢  i said   tell me what you like  i can t recollect him Ã¢  she said   i shall describe him to you Ã¢  i said   if i take descriptions of people who come to my house i must have a very good memory  but  perhaps  if you show him to me i may recollect him Ã¢  at that time there was 500l  reward against moss  and it appeared to me they would not let me see himÃ¢  david made me a present of 2l  to induce me to say i knew him  but i would not q  but you took the 2l   a  certainly  why should not i  but when i came to the office he was pointed out to me  and i said   no  i can t swear to him   and i would not swear to him q  it was given to you to swear moss had been at your coffee house with caspar  a  he made me a present of itÃ¢  the handkerchief was shown by my wife  but not in my presenceÃ¢  i believe i did not see itÃ¢  i might have seen it  or i might notÃ¢  i believe i did not  because it was shown to them beforeÃ¢  they had called twice q  was it not mentioned in that conversation that you should swear that handkerchief was left when the prisoner was at your house  a  i cannot recollect it q  do you mean to swear you cannot recollect  a  i cannot recollect that the handkerchief was shown q  that is not the questionÃ¢  will you swear you cannot recollect whetherthe 2l  was given to you to swear you found it there on a day when the prisoner bad been at your shop  a  i do not recollectÃ¢  i do not know what they gave me the 2l  for court  q  did they suggest to you that you should prove the handkerchief was left when the prisoner was there  at the time you had the 2l   a  the 2l  was given to me to swear i knew moss  to identify himÃ¢  there was no talk about the handkerchief  to my recollection mr  jones  q  now  were you not asked  in the course of conversation  to swear the handkerchief was left there on a day when the prisoner was there  a  it might be soÃ¢  i will not swear to what i cannot recollectÃ¢  you will not make me swear what i do not recollectÃ¢  it might have been said so court  q  were you not asked   cannot you prove this handkerchief was left at the time caspar was at your house   a  yes  that was the caseÃ¢  it was leftÃ¢  that was the point  that i should identify moss  which i would not do mr  jones  q  did not davis bring a handkerchief with him on that occasion  a  he did notÃ¢  nor did mrs  abrahams  neither of themÃ¢  no handkerchief was produced but this one  which i believe to be the handkerchief i found court  q  did either of them state to you that they were in a condition to prove the handkerchief left with you belonged to moss  a  yes  mrs  abrahams said so mr  jones  q  can you tell how either davis or mrs  abrahams knew that the handkerchief was left there  a  i told mrs  abrahams and mr  davis there was a handkerchief left by those people  by mr  caspar  here it is  and i showed it to themÃ¢  they had not said a word about a handkerchief before i didÃ¢  i will swear that they never mentioned a single word till i showed itÃ¢  they then asked whether i recollected caspar calling  with another gentleman with him  mr  mossÃ¢  i said   i don t know him  i knew caspar from a child Ã¢  they said   do you know what has happened  Ã¢  i said   i have heard there is some robbery Ã¢  they said   you  remember he came to have some coffee Ã¢  i said   yes  caspar came with another person  but i don t know him Ã¢  mrs  abrahams described him  and said that he had whiskers before  and that he took the whiskers offÃ¢  i said   i can say nothing about it till you show me the man Ã¢  davis gave me 2l Ã¢  i said   very well  i will receive this as a gift  but i must see the man before i swear to himÃ¢  i did not return the money when i could not swear to him court  q  did you show them the handkerchief and say   i cannot swear to the man until i have seen him  but i have a handkerchief that one of them i believe left   a  noÃ¢  they had been several times  but the  first time they came i was out  and i understood my wife had shown it to themÃ¢  she looked at it and at last found a markÃ¢  mrs  abrahams said   oh  i believe he has lost a handkerchief Ã¢  davis then gave me the 2l  to swear positively to moss that i knew him  but i said   i will go to the police office   but when i got there i did not know him  and would not swear to himÃ¢  they asked me to swear that i saw him mr  jones  q  did they ask you to swear caspar was there  a  yes  they did of courseÃ¢  i do not know whether it was before or after they asked me to swear that  that they gave me the 2l Ã¢  i could not deny caspar being there  as i knew himÃ¢  they asked me to state caspar was thereÃ¢  i cannot say whether it was after that that they gave methe 2l Ã¢  that is the only sum i have received from any personÃ¢  if they had offered me 100l  it would be the same as 2l Ã¢  i was quite satisfied  i would not swear to any thing i did not knowÃ¢  i did not ask them for any moreÃ¢  they did not promise me any moreÃ¢  they promised me if i wished to do so that they would give me a 20l  note if i would identify caspar  i mean moss  but i would not q  i ask you if they did not offer you a 20l  note to swear caspar was there  a  i told you they  in the plural  they both were thereÃ¢  they did not ask me particularly to swear that the prisoner was there  but that both he and moss were thereÃ¢  that was after moss was taken upÃ¢  i have never seen davis sinceÃ¢  i did not see him at lambeth street officeÃ¢  the only time i saw him was at my house  twice he calledÃ¢  i knew him from seeing him  but had not any particular knowledge of himÃ¢  i will not swear i had not spoken to him before  but i never had any business with him  nor did i know what he wasÃ¢  i did not know he lived in coventry court till afterwardsÃ¢  i never went thereÃ¢  i kept the coffee shop ten or eleven monthsÃ¢  i was also an agent for foreign winesÃ¢  my counting house is 84  lower tower streetÃ¢  i am still an agent for foreign winesÃ¢  i do commissionsÃ¢  i am a general agentÃ¢  before i went to tower street i kept a fancy toy shop in lowther arcadeÃ¢  i was there eighteen monthsÃ¢  i was always the same trade  a foreign agent in the wine trade  and so i am now q  what do you mean  a  suppose a foreigner comes over  having wines to sell  i have customers  and sell them  and my commission is five per centÃ¢  i have been a bankrupt  to my misfortune  only once  and obtained my certificate in 1824Ã¢  i have twice taken the benefit of the insolvent actÃ¢  the last time is three years and a half agoÃ¢  i believe the first time was about seven years agoÃ¢  i was discharged the first timeÃ¢  i was remanded once i believe six or seven months  but i did not stop all the time out  because i settled with the detaining creditorÃ¢  i was detained for defending an action without groundsÃ¢  i have never been in the habit of becoming bail for people mr  clarkson  q  can you tell how the prisoner  or any body belonging to him  knew any thing about davis and mrs  abrahams coming to your house  a  i do not knowÃ¢  i was examined on the former trial when mrs  abrahams was chargedÃ¢  i was not then asked a word about the 2l Ã¢  i have heard that davis is indicted with the restÃ¢  i never had any doubt that the prisoner was one of the persons who came to my houseÃ¢  i never attempted to swear moss was the other manÃ¢  they offered me 20l  to swear itÃ¢  i did not know  at the time davis and mrs  abrahams came to my house  that mrs  abrahams had had the gold dust through her handsÃ¢  i never knew that either she or davis had had any thing to do with it james lea  i was an officer of lambeth street  on the 25th of march i remember the prisoner coming to the office and seeing mr  hardwicke  the magistrate  about half past two o clockÃ¢  he produced these two lettersÃ¢   nos  3 and 4 Ã¢  he said a serious robbery had taken place that morning  at irongate wharf  and that a person had come in a cab from mr  marchÃ¢  he gave me a description of the mode in which it had been effected  that he had given it to a person who came in the name of mr  marchÃ¢  i afterwards went to irongate wharfÃ¢  he staid some few minutes with me at the wharfÃ¢  he then left me  and said he could be of no further use to meÃ¢  i staid some time  and then went to the office in john street  and saw the prisonerÃ¢  he opened a drawer  and producedthree or four letters of messrs  carries   and asked my opinion as to the writing  whether it did not correspond with the two letters i had before seenÃ¢  he said he considered himself they were one and the same writingÃ¢  i said   no  they appear to me quite a different writing Ã¢  he then particularly drew my attention to messrs  carne s signatureÃ¢  i said that appeared to correspond with the others very muchÃ¢  he said it was principally on the faith of the signature he had given the order to the person for the boxesÃ¢  i asked him at that time the description of the person who had been to receive the orderÃ¢  he said he was a man shorter than himself  grey whiskers  it appeared as if he had been a traveller  that he had a weather beaten countenanceÃ¢  if i recollect right  he said he appeared to be about sixty years of age  and had grey hairÃ¢  he laid he did not know himÃ¢  he said he supposed  from what he stated  that he had come from mr  march  and he did not know whether it was mr  march or notÃ¢  about eight o clock that night i was at the swan with two necks  making inquiry about the falmouth coach  and while there  the prisoner and his father came inÃ¢  he inquired about the falmouth mail  and said he was going by the falmouth mailÃ¢  i made inquiry  and found the mail had been gone about a quarter of an hour before they came inÃ¢  i told the prisoner i thought if he had a wish to go  be might overtake the mail at the southampton rail roadÃ¢  i went with them in a coach  but the mail had been gone about ten minutes i thinkÃ¢  the mail goes by the rail roadÃ¢  i do not think he had stated to me before  any intention of going to falmouthÃ¢  i have no recollection of itÃ¢  he called at two or three coach offices coming back  and said he should go next morningÃ¢  as we returned  ellis caspar left the coachÃ¢  i am not quite positive where he left itÃ¢  i thought it was at charing cross  but it was between charing cross and st  paul sÃ¢  the prisoner said there would be hand bills out next day  and 500l  reward offeredÃ¢  he said mr  allen  and mr  de mole were to have them printedÃ¢  i expressed a wish to see mr  de mole before they were printed  and the prisoner requested his father to go immediately to prevent their being printedÃ¢  i had been to the st  paul s coffee house in the morning  and found three persons were putting up there from the falmouth mail that day  and i went to see themÃ¢  i called there again in the evening with the prisoner  after his father leftÃ¢  i gave a description of the person as the prisoner had given me  grey hair  and whiskers  a person  shorter than him  and about sixty years of ageÃ¢  he never contradicted me  or said that was not the personÃ¢  there was a description given then  that such a person had been thereÃ¢  one of the three who had come by the mailÃ¢  i think the waiter gave me that description  and the prisoner said that appeared the sort of description of the personÃ¢  that person was described as about sixty years of age  with grey hair and whiskersÃ¢  the prisoner also said he thought i could not do better than to pursue the inquiry there  and stick to the person at that houseÃ¢  he also told me the same thing  two days afterwards q  how long afterwards did you trace the cab to new street  a  the first cab i traced  when the prisoner was with me  in the minoriesÃ¢  i afterwards traced a cab to the neighbourhood of new street  and went to a house in new street  which had no tenant  and where a plate had been taken off the doorÃ¢  i have since ascertained that to be moss s houseÃ¢  i found a quantity of nails in the grate  and some under the grate  and some in the dust hole q  could you judge what had been burning in the fire place  a  it appeared to me to be white wood ashesÃ¢  there were several pieces of wood  and about sixty nails  which i produced at the last trialÃ¢  some of the wood was partly consumedÃ¢  i left them here at the last trialÃ¢  i went to new street three or four days after the robberyÃ¢  i did not notice any sealing waxÃ¢  i afterwards went with mr  hartley to mansel street  and saw the prisoner  about five o clock in the evening  with his father  nearly opposite moss s house  in mansel streetÃ¢  i had some conversation with the prisoner afterwardsÃ¢  i took mrs  moss and mrs  levy into custodyÃ¢  i afterwards produced a box  found in a small room adjoining the bed roomÃ¢  i ultimately produced five gold bars cross examined  q  from what you saw of the prisoner  did not he appear anxious to afford you every assistance to find out the thieves  a  he appeared very uneasy when he came to the office about itÃ¢  i should say he expressed great anxiety to find out the thieves for the first half hourÃ¢  i saw very little of him after the first dayÃ¢  he did on the first dayÃ¢  he went with me to the wharf  and to the coffee houseÃ¢  he was the first person i received information from of the jobberyÃ¢  he did not describe the man as rather taller than himself  i understood him shorterÃ¢  as far as my recollection serves me  i think he said shorterÃ¢  i will not be positiveÃ¢  i stated on the last trial  that that was the description he gaveÃ¢  i obtained from the cat men a description of the man who went to the wharfÃ¢  that description did not correspond with the one given me by the prisonerÃ¢  neither of themÃ¢  harland described him as a tall man  in black  and dark whiskersÃ¢  i do not recollect macbeth s descriptionÃ¢  he said nothing to me about grey hairÃ¢  he did not describe him as about sixty years of ageÃ¢  i received a description from blundellÃ¢  he said he was a tall person with dark hair  and whiskersÃ¢  the first cab man i saw was harlandÃ¢  i saw three altogether  but the first i have not mentioned  as i could not find his addressÃ¢  the prisoner went with me  when i saw that cab man  who said he had been with a person to the office  in john street  and put a person down at the bankÃ¢  i asked that person for a description of him  and he described him as a tall man  in black  and dark hair  and he thought he had the appearance of a jewÃ¢  he did not describe him as a man with grey hair  and whiskers  and that cab man identified the prisoner as having come to our office in his cabÃ¢  i said   it is strange you should come here in the same cab Ã¢  it was not through the information i received from the prisoner that i traced the cabsÃ¢  he said the man came in a yellow cab with four wheelsÃ¢  that was the only description of itÃ¢  i never could find that cab man out afterwardsÃ¢  the other two cab men were examined at the officeÃ¢  neither of them stated  on seeing moss  that he was not the manÃ¢  the first cab man was not examined  for i took his number down  and i expect i made a mistake in one of the figures  for i could not trace him outÃ¢  the first cab man did not see moss in my presence court  q  what time did the prisoner come to you in that cab said to be the same  a  about half past two or three o clock prisoner  the first cab man was examined  and said he could not recognise moss  and so his deposition was not taken  witness  i do not recollect any thing of that kind prisoner  he lived in gray s inn road  witness  yes  he gave me his direction  but i could trace no such person out mr  jones  q  are you quite positive he was never examined at lambeth street  a  i do not recollect seeing himÃ¢  i cannot say that he did not state moss was not the manÃ¢  i know nothing of itÃ¢  i received the gold bars from dean  solomon s shopman  on the 17th of aprilÃ¢  i left the swan with two necks in a coach  in company with the two caspars  i think from ten minutes to a quarter after eight o clock  and went to the southampton railway at queen s elmsÃ¢  we got there in about half an hour  staid there about five minutes and then came backÃ¢  we called at two booking offices in the circus  st  james s street  and another in piccadillyÃ¢  i think it must have been somewhere about nine o clock when ellis caspar left the coachÃ¢  it might be a quarter pastÃ¢  it might be half past  i will not pretend to sayÃ¢  we drove fast backÃ¢  we went up waterloo placeÃ¢  we made no stay thereÃ¢  the prisoner got out and inquired about the coachÃ¢  ellis caspar was not with me in st  paul s church yard i knowÃ¢  i cannot recollect precisely where he got outÃ¢  i rather think it was between charing cross and st  paul s church yard q  supposing he got out at charing cross  how far is that from moss s house  in new street  a  two miles and a half  i thinkÃ¢  i do not think it is three milesÃ¢  about two and a halfÃ¢  i think it is under three milesÃ¢  we made no stop at either place coming backÃ¢  we left the station at about twenty minutes before nine o clockÃ¢  it would take the best part of a quarter of an hour to get to charing crossÃ¢  it is about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes  drive from charing cross to queen s elmsÃ¢  i am sure it was not ten o clock when ellis caspar left us q  will you swear it was not a quarter to ten  a  i cannot swear to a quarter of an hour john howard  i was employed by lea  in march last  to watch some people about this robberyÃ¢  i remember good fridayÃ¢  i do not know the day of the monthÃ¢  on that day i saw the prisoner with his fatherÃ¢  i first of all followed the prisoner from mr  hartley s office in john street to his own house in finsbury pavementÃ¢  he went into the house and waited some timeÃ¢  shortly after  his father came out with him  and i followed them down to the office in john street togetherÃ¢  on the monday following the 1st of april  i saw the prisoner with his father in mansel street about five o clockÃ¢  i know moss s house in mansel streetÃ¢  they were about as far from moss s house as i am from the door of this courtÃ¢  i observed ellis caspar put his hand up  pointing to what appeared to me the apartments where moss was living  lolling his head towards the prisoner cross examined  q  have you been in the habit of being employed in that way  a  on one occasionÃ¢  i am now employed in the london dockÃ¢  i watched the prisoner s house on one occasion  but saw nothingÃ¢  i was directed to follow himÃ¢  i followed him to finsbury pavement  and on the door was written  caspar Ã¢  i waited a considerable time and saw nothingÃ¢  i have never said i watched their house from morning till nightÃ¢  i stated on the last trial that i watched the prisoners all 1 could  but never said about watching their house james leare examined bymr  jones  q  did you make inquiry at mr  hartley s office of the different clerks there  as to the description of the man who went in the cab  a  i didÃ¢  they did not all agree in the descriptionÃ¢  one of them differedÃ¢  none of them described the man as having grey whiskersÃ¢  i believe mitchell gave a different description of him q  did you not swear on the last trial that blundell described the manprecisely in the same way as the prisoner had  a  no  i do not recollectÃ¢  one of mr  hartley s servants gave a different description of himÃ¢  some said he was taller than the other  and different to what the other described himÃ¢  it is possible one of them might have said something about grey whiskersÃ¢  one of them  i do not recollect which  said he thought he had grey hairs in his whiskersÃ¢  i do not recollect stating on the last trial that blundell s description corresponded with the prisoners as to the whiskersÃ¢  as near as i can recollect  i think it was mitchell stated something about itÃ¢  i remember one of them said he had grey hairs in his whiskersÃ¢  i might have said blundell s description corresponded with the prisoner s as to having grey hairs in his whiskers no 5   read    london  23rd march  1839 Ã¢  messrs  w  and e  c  came Ã¢  dear sirs  a most diabolical robbery has been committed here through the means of forging your signatures to two letters  on the other side i send a copy of them  and i beg that you will use your utmost exertions towards discovering the perpetrator  the impression is that it must have been done by persons who have had access to your office or knew of all the particulars as early as yourselves  the letters were posted at falmouth on the 23rd  and arrived with this morning s manifest  shortly after a gentleman called  requesting the delivery of two boxes marked  b c 18 and 19   he showed me a letter which purported to be mr  march s  or from him  i had not the slightest suspicion  and referred him to the wharf  writing an order for their delivery  unfortunately they were handed to him  and it only remains to use every exertion to obtain a clue  let me beg and entreat of you to show your usual zeal in this matter  believe me  dear sirs  i am almost heart broken  yours very truly  l  casper  the man who called at my office appeared about fifty or sixty years of age  grey whiskers  middling stature  very dark complexion  swarthy  or very sunburnt  as an old traveller would appear  has a country dialect  as if from your parts  i think he was lame  as he walked very slow  or perhaps limped  james hands  police constable k 248   i was at lambeth street office on the 14th of june i thinkÃ¢  i do not exactly recollect the dateÃ¢  the prisoner  ellis caspar  mrs  abrahams  and moses were all four in confinement in one cell in the officeÃ¢  i heard the prisoner conversing with mosesÃ¢  they were talking loudÃ¢  i was not in a situation to see as well as hearÃ¢  i heard the prisoner say to moses   do you intend to let me have any money  i want 40l  or 50l  to prepare for my defence Ã¢  moses answered   no  i want four or five fifties to pay or prepare for my own Ã¢  the prisoner said   had i have had the 1400l  or 1200l  as you promised me  things might have been different Ã¢  moses said  you are a bÃ¢  Ã¢  rogue  you did not give him even what you had Ã¢  he did not mention who he meant by himÃ¢  there was something said then which i did not hear  and i heard moses say   did you ever give him 5l   cross examined  q  were there any other persons than those you have mentioned confined in the cell  a  no  none but the fourÃ¢  there was not a drunken woman confined as wellÃ¢  there was no drunken woman in custody then  nor any womanÃ¢  there was a drunken woman in the yard  but that was some time afterwardsÃ¢  the cell door was shut when i heard this conversationÃ¢  there were only those two talkingÃ¢  i did not hear the others speakÃ¢  i was in the yardÃ¢  i cannot exactly say how longÃ¢  it might be a quarter of an hour  or five minutes more or lessÃ¢  my attention was taken by hearing them talk  and i went to the door to listenÃ¢  i didnot go backwards and forwards while they were talkingÃ¢  i kept by the doorÃ¢  i cannot exactly say how long i was listening q  when was the first time you told of this conversation  a  i communicated it in part within a few minutes after  to cook  the gaoler  at lambeth streetÃ¢  he heard part of it himself  i believeÃ¢  i stated that at the last trial  and at lambeth street  it might be an hour or two hours after i heard itÃ¢  i had seen the prisoner before that dayÃ¢  i had been in the habit of standing  while he was under examination before the magistrate  close to himÃ¢  i had heard him speak beforeÃ¢  i believe  with the exception of one examination  i heard him every time  which was  i think  six timesÃ¢  i heard him speak while his case was being heardÃ¢  he was in conversation with his solicitor and othersÃ¢  i have never said there was so much confusion in the yard that i could not hear exactly what was saidÃ¢  i said i lost part of the conversation in consequence of an old man coming to draw water from a tap in the yardÃ¢  i did not hear the prisoner ask moses to lend him 5l   or that he had promised to lend him 5l Ã¢  that did not pass in my hearing q  did not you state on the last occasion that he said   if i had got the 1200l  or 1400l   as you have  i would not have denied you   a  the prisoner said that before the magistrateÃ¢  when i made the statement before the magistrate  he admitted the conversation  but said he had said  had he got the 1200l  or 1400l   as he  moses was said to have had  he should not have objected to let him have 5l Ã¢  that was the substance of the explanation he gave mr  clarkson  q  was the prisoner s explanation a correct account of what passed  or was the account you have given on oath  a  the account i have given on oath adolphus fiestellre examined bymr  jones  my brother in law  callaway  who was my waiter  appeared as a witness on the last trialÃ¢  i was not present when he was examinedÃ¢  he was waiting on the day the prisoner and the other persons were at my coffee houseÃ¢  he waited on themÃ¢  i do not know where he isÃ¢  i cannot find himÃ¢  he left

examined  q  did you go to brighton  a  no  i did not know what part to go to  nor have i sent after himÃ¢  i inquired of fiestell where he wasÃ¢  he said he did not knowÃ¢  i did not hear callaway examined at the last trialÃ¢  i am sure i was not in court when he was examinedÃ¢  i do not think i was in court at the time william blundellre examined  q  did you ever  and if so  at what time  inform the prisoner you had heard some of the gold dust had been found in mansel street  a  no q  did not you tell him mr  hartley was waiting at house in mansel street  or some such street  where he expected to find the thief  or some of the property  and did not you tell him you were going to take some letters to mr  hartley at a house in mansel street  where be expected to find some gold  a  i was going to the green man public house  mansel street and told the prisoner i was going there  and that i expected to see moss thereÃ¢  i told him that  when i went for the letters to the officeÃ¢  i cannot say when it was court  q  how long after the 25th of march was that  a  some few days  i thinkÃ¢  i cannot rememberÃ¢  it might be a fortnightÃ¢  somewhere thereaboutsÃ¢  i was going with letters to the green man public houseÃ¢  i expected to find mr  hartley there  but he was notÃ¢  moss was to have been brought there  i understoodÃ¢  i did not see any thing of the goldÃ¢  i did not describe to the prisoner who moss wasÃ¢  whether they said moss or the man whom they suspected had stolen the dust  i do not know q  who are they  a  the person by whom i was sentÃ¢  somebody in the officeÃ¢  i believe it was the conversation in the office that mr  hartley was gone to the green man public house  and they expected to find the thief thereÃ¢  whether i mentioned moss by name  i do not knowÃ¢  i cannot say when i first heard the name of moss in the transactionÃ¢  it was in the afternoon that i told this to the prisonerÃ¢  i was going to take the general post letters which came that morning by the second delivery q  cannot you tell nearer than that it might be a fortnight after the 25th  a  i cannot sayÃ¢  i cannot say whether it might be longer or shorterÃ¢  i cannot say

examined as a witnessÃ¢  i was not desired to be here mr  jones  q  had you stated to mr  yates what you had said to your brother about his being at home  a  i merely stated the circumstance  and have said how cruel it was to say so and so about my brother  when i knew the contrary q  were you willing to come forward as a witness on the last trial  to state this if asked to do it  a  a place like this i was almost afraid of coming to  but on it being represented it was useful to my brother  i could not refuse to come q  on your solemn oath  is what you have said about your brother being at

conversation with my brotherÃ¢  i do not recollect upon what subjectÃ¢  he left about three o clockÃ¢  the dinner cloth was being laid while he staid thereÃ¢  dinner was brought up while he was there

require his coining down stairs  a  yes  his boot maker called that morning  and was waiting for him to have an answer about his boots  which he had brought home on saturday nightÃ¢  when he came down

the sunday  talking to the said mr  wilsonÃ¢  i did not know that my father was said to be in another place on that sundayÃ¢  i knew he was described to be at moss s house on sundayÃ¢  i knew he was at home q  why was it you did not come here to state it in the last case  a  because the counsellors did not think it necessary witnesses should be called  i understoodÃ¢  mr  riddington is the master

did not talk to the man while he was having his break fast q  did he take any breakfast  a  he took a cup of coffee  as well as i can recollect  but he was very late that morningÃ¢  he merely swallowed a cup of coffee and went out almost as soon as he got in the parlourÃ¢  he told the man he could not wait to try them on that morning  and then left the house i think while the man was thereÃ¢  i did not see my brother edward go out with the lunch that morningÃ¢  i did not give him the lunchÃ¢  we sometimes breakfasted before my brotherÃ¢  sometimes we breakfasted earlier than he roseÃ¢  on that morning we were breakfasting when he came downÃ¢  the family were sitting at breakfast when he came downÃ¢  myself  my mother  and edwardÃ¢  we were having breakfast togetherÃ¢  being late that morning  breakfastwas nearly done when riddington s man cameÃ¢  edward and all the family were sitting at breakfast when i went up stairs to call my brotherÃ¢  i left them at the breakfast table  but i must name to you  that we did not break fast in the parlour where riddington s man came in  but in another parlour mr  jones  q  was edward at breakfast with you and the family that morning  a  yesÃ¢  i did not take any notice of what passed between my brother and riddington s manÃ¢  at least i do not think he satisfied the man  he had not time to answer himÃ¢  i was not at home in the middle of the day on mondayÃ¢  i saw my father on monday morningÃ¢  the latest time i saw him on monday morning was between ten and eleven o clock  i thinkÃ¢  he was in the habit of attending

and cheese  any thing there wasÃ¢  he did not take it with himÃ¢  edward used to take it to himÃ¢  he very seldom took it himselfÃ¢  he used to say he would do without any  but we nearly always used to send him lunch  and we used to send it as early as we could to himÃ¢  john street is about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour s walkÃ¢  we sent every dayÃ¢  he never took it himselfÃ¢  it was sent wrapped up in paper mr  jones  q  was the lunch generally sent by his direction  or through the anxiety of your mother  a  through the anxiety of my mother  for fear he should be faintÃ¢  he said there was no occasion for it  and that was the reason he did not take it himself grace caspar  i am the sister of ellen caspar  i remember sunday  the 24th of marchÃ¢  my brother got up about eleven o clock  or a little afterÃ¢  he and edward slept togetherÃ¢  he breakfasted when he came down that morningÃ¢  while he was there mr  wilson called to see himÃ¢  he is a draughtsman  and a clock case

    "Something to consider when looking at sentiment, outside of just general polarity like we did in the last section, people can create specialized dictionaries containing specific words of interest to try to analyze sentiment from a particular angle. One organization, the [Moral Foundations Theory](http://moralfoundations.org/), took this approach and we will now use it to see if we can understand Old Bailey's sentiment better. You should be doing something like this for your homework. We will be using a provided moral foundations dictionary."
