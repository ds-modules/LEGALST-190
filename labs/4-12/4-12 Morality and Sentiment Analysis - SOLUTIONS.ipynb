will answer my most anxious expectations q  now mrs  perry you have heard what has been read by that letter  did you deliver this money to him for any such consideration as that expressed there    a  no  i gave it him merely upon his representing to me  that he was to take this money  with the boy  to the captain q  and all that  you swear is a fiction    a  yes  guilty   aged 43  transported for

some with sticks  one of them hit me on my head by the side of my ear  and knocked me down with a large stick  i was fighting at that time for about ten minutes  the other officer ran away and left me at the coach door  i dare say i was knocked down a dozen times q  how many were there assembled together    a  i dare say near twenty  some beating me over my legs  and some over my thighs  they were armed with sticks and knives  they said  d   n your b   y eyes  let him go  one of them cut me on the fingers  on this hand  with a knife  another came up and hit me on my arm with a large driver s stick  i called out  griffin  my arm is cut  and i believe broken   immediately stanton  the officer  came up with a brace of pistols  somebody spoke to stanton  in the coach  and pointed out some man at the coach door  he said  he was trying to rescue freeman  stanton put a pistol to his breast  told him  if he did not go away  he would blow his brains out q  do you know who that man was    a  no  my arm was in so much pain  i could not swear to any one q  had you seen the man before to your knowledge    a  i saw him in the george  drinking  all with the prisoner trueman  i cannot positively say it was the same man  it was dark out in the road q  what part of newgate street was this    a  just by christ s hospital gate  i am quite sure i was cut across my hand with a knife mr  knapp  you never saw the prisoner after you saw him in the george  until you saw him in the court    a  not to my knowledge  charles griffin   i am a constable q  were you sent for on the 23d of september    a

something to drink  bray poured two glasses out of two pots  the prisoner said  let trueman have a glass   that is the first time  i did not see him again until we got into newgate street  when the coach was cut  and then i saw him there  the street was lined with people when the coach was cut down  the prisoner came to the coach door  lloyd was in the coach q  when the prisoner came to the coach  did he say any thing    a  he said nothing  i did not see him do any thing in the least  at that time  lloyd said  to a gentleman that came up  that man attempted to rescue trueman out  when stanton came up  the prisoner was standing at the coach door  i saw him there q  did any thing happen to bray    a  bray got out of the coach after it was cut down  the prisoner came up to the coach door  and bray came up to the coach door  he said  griffin  i have got my arm broken  and my fingers cut q  it was after bray came out of the coach that the prisoner came to the coach door    a  yes

i never see him after that time q  how long was it before or after bray s hand was cut    a  it was about ten minutes after bray said his hand was cut  when stanton came up with the pistols  that was the second time q  the first time he came up to the coach door  how near was that to bray s coming up and saying he was cut    a  a few minutes mr  knapp  i do not understand you  to say at that time when bray came up and said he was cut  and his arm broke  you did not see the prisoner then    a  no  i did not see him at the coach door q  at that time that bray informed you  did you see him at the coach door  or any where else at that time    a  i did not  i saw him about ten minutes after that  the second time  john higgings   q  were you sent for to the george inn  smithfield    a  yes  i was  i knew miss jackson  when i came there  i saw the prisoner  he called for a pint of ale  he was along with trueman q  do you remember the time the coach went away    a  i do  i followed sadler with the coach  when the coach went away  sadler followed the coach from the george  and about an hundred yards from the george  in smithfield  i saw the prisoner stop the horses  after having stopped the horses  he went of the near side of the coach  and tried to open the coach door  he could not get it open  then the coachman drove on very hard  he directly ran before the horses again  just as the coach got opposite of the hospital gates  he stopped the horses the second time  after that  the coachman found the reins were cut  he directly hollowed out  his reins were cut   after that  the coachman got into newgate street  i heard the prisoner say  to four or five of them  now  my boys  stick true to me  and we will have them away from the b   rs  q  how many persons were there following of him    a  near upon thirty of them from what i could see in the gang  a great many had sticks and knives q  i think you say you saw the prisoner twice at the horses heads    a  i did  and likewise in newgate street  after he made that expression to four or five of them  he went to the off side of the coach  and directly the coach fell down   it was instantly cut down  after he came up to the coach door  i heard stanton say  if you do not go away i will blow your brains out   after that i lost sight of him  i heard bray say he had his arm broke  i did not see him struck  i am quite sure sadler is the person  william stanton   i am an officer q  on the 23d of september  were you in newgate street    a  i had an information at the compter  i went to newgate street  when i got halfway down newgate street  i saw a mob  i quickened my pace  and got up to it  it was a great mob  indeed  i tried to go through the mob  some cried out  do not let him go through   i pulled a pair of pistols out of my pocket  and swore the first person that offered to stop me  i would blow his brains out  they pushed me backwards and forwards  they would not let me go through  when i got to the horses heads  i was tried to be stopped by a man  i did not exactly notice that man  i got to the coach door  there were some trying to open the coach door  i pushed them of one side  and looked in the coach window  i saw griffin  i said  what is the matter   he said  for god s sake assist us   i said i would  lloyd said  stanton  blow that man s brains out  if he does not go away from the coach   he said    that man has been following of us all the while   the prisoner is the man  to the best that i can recollect  i have no doubt about it  that is the man that tried to shove me under the coach  when i was endeavouring to get at the coach door  the pistols were locked  i unlocked one  and presented the pistol to him  and told him  if he did not go away  i would blow his brains out  i never saw any more of him  he went away q  are you sure that is the man that attempted to push you under the coach    a  yes  i have no doubt at all of it q  and the man that was pointed out to you    a  i have no doubt of it  it was very dark  i saw him by the light of the lamps  i got another coach and put trueman in  and then i saw bray s hand was cut by something sharp  daniel leadbetter   i am

to the constable  d   n your eyes  let go the stick  the constable said  i will not  when there was a cry of hamstring them  the constable gave a wrench and got the stick out of the prisoner s hands

they said  throw him over  when i got to the gate  i heard a voice say  throw him backwards  or throw him over  when i turned round  i saw a man stand at a small wicket door  i then took and threw the

      "   1629  francois benjamin courvoisierwas indicted for the wilful murder of william russell  esq   commonly called lord william russell messrs  adolphus  bodkin  andchambersconducted the prosecution sarah manser i was in the employment of the late lord william russell  as housemaid  âœ  for three yearsâ  he resided at no  14  norfolkstreet  park laneâ  a cook and valet were the only other servantsâ  the prisoner was the valetâ  the cook had been two years and nine months in his lordship s serviceâ  those were all the in door servants his lordship keptâ  he had also a coachman and groom who did not live in the houseâ  his lordship was a widower  and lived alone  on tuesday morning  the 5th of may  i saw his lordship a little before nine o clockâ  he came down before breakfastâ  he went out at one o clockâ  the prisoner had been in attendance on him all the morningâ  after his lordship had gone out  the prisoner said lord russell had given him five messages to attend to  and he was fearful he should forget some of themâ  he said one of them was to send the carriage to fetch his lordship from brooks s at five o clockâ  he asked me what brooks s wasâ  i told him it was a clubâ  the cook  the prisoner  and i dined together that day a little after one o clock  the usual hourâ  after dinner the prisoner went out off the messages he had been entrusted withâ  he returned a little before five o clock aloneâ  he told me he should go and get his lordship s things out to dressâ  soon after he returned  the upholsterer s man came to the house  that was about five o clockâ  he was in the house about a quarter of an hourâ  i saw him leave the houseâ  he went to tighten the pull on the bell of his lordship s bedroom  to tighten the handleâ  the prisoner went up stairs with the upholsterer s manâ  while they were up stairs the servant s bell rang at the area gateâ  it was a man named carr  an acquaintance of the prisoner sâ  i had seen him once before  about a fortnight beforeâ  he had then called to see the prisonerâ  carr came down the area steps into the kitchenâ  he remained till about six o clockâ  he took tea with us in the kitchenâ  the prisoner  the cook  myself  and carr took teaâ  while we were at tea thecoachman came in by the area stepsâ  on his coming down something was said about the carriage not having been sent for his lordshipâ  the prisoner said he had forgotten to order it  and he should tell his lordship that he had ordered it at half past five o clockâ  i told him he had better tell his lordship the truth  and his lordship would forgive himâ  he said   no    he should tell his lordship half past five o clock  his lordship was very forgetful  and must pay for his forgetful nessâ  the coachman upon that left the houseâ  after tea was over the prisoner went into his own pantry with carrâ   looking at a model of the premises â  this is the kitchen in which we took tea  and this adjoining room is the butler s pantry  where the prisoner went with carrâ  they were there about half an hourâ  lord russell soon after returned in a hackney cab  about twenty minutes to six o clockâ  i went to the pantry door and said   courvoisier  his lordship has been obliged to come home in a cab â  he then went up and let his lordship inâ  he went into the dining room  which is on the groundfloor  immediately over the kitchenâ  his lordship soon after rang the bell  the prisoner went up  and afterwards came  down with a letter in his handâ  he told me he was going to take it to the stable by lord russell s directionâ  he then went out  and carr with himâ  i saw nothing more of carrâ  the prisoner was not absent more than five or ten minutes  about as long as it would take him to go to the stableâ  he returned down the area stepsâ  he told me in the pantry that his lordship seemed angry when he first came in  but he got quite good tempered afterâ  the prisoner brought in a dog of his lordship s when he came from the stableâ  lord russell then went out with his dog for a walk  as it was his custom to do every dayâ  he returned about half past six o clockâ  the prisoner was soon after employed in making arrangements for lord russell s dinnerâ  seven o clock was the dinner hourâ  about seven o clock a bellhanger came to fasten the handle of the door of lord russell s roomâ  the prisoner requested me to go up with that workman  and i did soâ  he was not in the house more than five or ten minutesâ  i did not go down stairs with himâ  he went out by the areaâ  he mended the handle of the doorâ  lord russell dined at home alone in the dining room on the ground floorâ  he was waited upon by the prisonerâ  he afterwards went up into the back drawing roomâ  he used to go up there to writeâ  i left him there when i went to bedâ  he did not come down again to my knowledgeâ  the coachman came in a little before nine o clock to fetch the dogâ  i saw nothing more of the coachman that eveningâ  the prisoner and i supped together that evening  a little before nine o clockâ  the cook had gone outâ  during supper the prisoner and i had some conversation about change of servants  about a new cook coming into the houseâ  the cook was going away  and a new cook expectedâ  a friend of mine had applied for the placeâ  the prisoner said  if his lordship did not take that friend he should not recommend any one himselfâ  another person had appliedâ  he said he wished he had not come into bis lordship s service  as he did not like it so well as he thought he shouldâ  nothing else passedâ  nothing was said about richmond that eveningâ  on the 22nd of april  the day lord russell came to london  the prisoner said his lordship had been very cross and peevish  as they had changed his room three times while he was stopping at the castle at richmondâ  i told him that must have been the reason that his lordship was angryâ  he said his lordship had lost a locket while they were at richmondâ  he said he did not know how it was lost he could not find itâ  he said he did not know how the late valet could have stopped so long with his lordship  he did not think his temper would allow him to stop so longâ  some time after he said he must write to the porter at richmond about the locketâ  he did not say what porterâ  it was not many days before the 5th of may that he said thatâ  i think it was about between the 22nd of april and the 5th of mayâ  i never heard him say any thing after that about the locketâ  on the evening in question the cook returned soon after ten o clockâ  the prisoner let her inâ  she came in at the front doorâ  after the cook came in the prisoner went out to fetch her a pint of porterâ  he went out by the area gateâ  he was only gone a few minutesâ  there is a public house close byâ  when he returned with the porter i do not know whether he locked the area gate or notâ  i did not see him bring in any thing but the porterâ  he made no observation about itâ  the area gate was generally kept unlocked in the dayâ  it was either the prisoner s or the cook s duty to fasten itâ  the key used to hang on a nail in the kitchenâ  i do not remember to have seen the key in the kitchen after he came in with the porterâ  i left the kitchen a few minutes after ten o clock to go to bedâ  it might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterâ  i slept in the front room  third floor  immediately over the room in which lord russell sleptâ  the cook slept in the same roomâ  we slept in two separate bedsâ  the room in which we slept had a lumber room taken off from itâ  my bed was against the window  and the cook s against the doorâ  i should have to pass the cook s bed in going to or returning from mineâ  it was my duty before i went to bed to light a fire in lord russell s bed roomâ  i did so that nightâ  after lighting it i went up to my own bed roomâ  there is a door at the foot of the stairs leading from the landing by lord russell s door to the room where i and the cook sleptâ  the prisoner slept in the back room  third floor  next to oursâ  every thing appeared to me in the usual state in lord russell s room when i lighted the fire  the same as on other nightsâ  the room immediately joining lord russell s bed room was not usedâ  it is a sort of lumber roomâ  there is a door from that room leading into lord russell s roomâ  the door which opened from the landing had a spring on it which caused it to close of itselfâ  the opening and closing of that door made no noise  without it was shut hardâ  the door at the foot of the stairs leading up to our room shut easilyâ  the door of lord russell s bedroom was covered with baizeâ  the door at the foot of the stairs had a common latch  and had no coveringâ  that door was sometimes closed at night  and sometimes left openâ  the cook came up stairs about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after meâ  i was in bed when she came upâ  she went to bed q  did you  or the cook to your knowledge leave that bed room any more that night  a  no  i heard no noise  nor was i disturbed by any thing in the course of the nightâ  it would be the prisoner s duty to remain up below till his lordship went to bedâ  the fire was left burning in the kitchen  and a supply of coals leftâ  the cook used to attend to the fireâ  at the time i went to bed lord russell was in the back drawing roomâ  i saw a light in the back drawing room as i went up stairs  and a little before that i heard the back drawing room bell ringâ  i awoke about half past six o clock next morningâ  the cook was then in bed asleepâ  half past six o clock was about the time i usually got upâ  as i was going down stairs from my own room i knocked at the prisoner s bed room doorâ  i was accustomed to do thatâ  i did not hear any answer given to my knockâ  i found the door at the foot of the attic stairs slightly openâ  i noticed the warming pan on the landingadjoining lord russell s roomâ  it was lying on the landing with the handle nearest to the bed room doorâ  it laid across the door that would go into the back room which was not usedâ  you would have to step over the warming pan to get into the back room q  did it leave the passage to and from lord russell s room uninterrupted  a  yesâ  it was the prisoner s duty to warm his lordship s bed every nightâ  the warming pan was generally taken down into the kitchen afterwardsâ  during the five weeks the prisoner was in the service the bed had been warmed every night when his lordship was in townâ  once before the warming pan had been left on the landingâ  i spoke to him about it  and told him it was not the proper place to leave itâ  i do not remember how long before the 5th of may that wasâ  i think it was before lord russell went to richmondâ  i left it there on this occasion  and went into the backroom adjoining his lordship s bed roomâ  i was not in that room a momentâ  i went in there for my broomâ  i did not observe whether the door between that and lord russell s room was closed or notâ  i then went down stairs into the back drawing room  where i had left his lordship the night beforeâ  i noticed his lordship s writing desk turned roundâ  it is what is called a davenport desk  with a sloping top which lifts upâ  four drawers were open  and the top jammed up with papersâ  i observed his lordship s bunch of keys and several of his papers lying on the hearth rugâ  i noticed a screw driver lying on his lordship s writing chairâ  i had seen that in the butler s pantry a few days before  in a bottom cupboard next the fire  in a little tool boxâ  i had seen it there two or three days beforeâ  the tool box is one that the late valet hadâ  it belonged to the placeâ  i did not notice any thing in the front drawing roomâ  i opened the front drawing room shuttersâ  i then went down stairs  and into this passageâ   pointing it out on the model â  when i got into the passage  i saw a number of things lying behind the street door  which was shutâ  i went up to the doorâ  it had no fastening but the latchâ  any body from the outside could open it with a latch keyâ  there were two bolts to the door  top and bottom  a double lock  and a chain  besides the latch q  what did you first notice when you came down  a  i saw a number of things lying against the doorâ  i was then at the bottom of the stairsâ  i then went up to the door and noticed bis lordship s large blue cloakâ  that was part of the number of thingsâ  it was not lying very close to the doorâ  a little distance from it  was his lordship s opera glass  a little trinket box lying on the top  and a number of things tied up in a napkin  which i did not examine at that time â  that was lying a little nearer the door than the cloakâ  the cloak was folded up very neatlyâ  i did not at that time notice any other articleâ  i examined the things after the police came into the houseâ  there was his lordship s gold pencil case  a gold tooth pick and caseâ  the pencil case was in the folds of the napkin  and the tooth pickcase alsoâ  there was also a silver sugar dredger  a little silver caddy spoon  a silver top of a salt dredger  a pair of his lordship s spectacles  tipped with silver  a little cayenne spoon  a top of a silver dish cover  and the cook s silver thimbleâ  i knew the napkin to be the same that i had given out on the monday for his lordship s dinnerâ  i had seen it on the tuesday  just before the prisoner went to lay the cloth in the pantryâ  i asked the prisoner if he wanted a clean oneâ  he said no  he would make it do twice q  where were these things usually kept  a  the cloak was kept in the dining room  on the last chair against the windowâ  the opera glass in hislordship s bed room  on the shelf over the fire place  the little trinket case  to the best of my belief  was kept in his dressing case  but i am not certain  the gold pencil case and tooth pick his lordship generally carried about with him  and generally put them on a small table in his bed room at nightâ  he had three pairs of spectaclesâ  i do not know where he kept themâ  the silver dredger was kept in the cupboard next to the fire in the pantry  and the caddy spoon  and silver top of the coverâ  the dish cover was kept in a cupboard in the sideboard in the dining roomâ  the other part of the dish was also kept thereâ  the prisoner had the key of that cupboardâ  i do not know whether it was locked or notâ  when i went up to the street door i did not examine it  but just looked at itâ  i set the dining room door open and saw a number of things lying on the floorâ  the shutters were closed  and i set the door open to give me light  as i felt alarmed seeing those things  and then i went and opened the shuttersâ  after i had opened the shutters  i saw the candlesticksâ  i do not know whether they were plated or silverâ  some were plated and some silverâ  the bottom of the dish cover and some sugar was on the floorâ  all the drawers and cupboard doors were openâ  i felt dreadfully alarmed  and ran up stairs to tell the cookâ  i found her in bedâ  i said something to herâ  she made me an answerâ  in consequence of what she said i went to the door of the prisoner s roomâ  i said   courvoisier  do you know of any thing being the matter last night   â  he said    no â  his room door was shutâ  it was opened instantly by him q  how long elapsedâœ  between your first knocking at the door to awake him  and your going and knocking and speaking to him  a  i should say ten minutesâ  when he opened the door he was dressed all but his coatâ  he used to wash in the pantry belowâ  he was dressed in the usual way that morning  except his coatâ  he used to put his coat on before he came downâ  i did not notice any thing but his waistcoatâ  that was the same he generally woreâ  he had his shoes onâ  sometimes i have seen him come down without shoes  and sometimes with themâ  he generally came down stairs dressedâ  on his opening the door  i said   do you know what has been the matter last night   â  he said   no â  i said   all your silver and things are about â  he looked very pale and agitatedâ  he did not make me any answerâ  he came out of his room  and put his coat on as he was going down the attic stairsâ  he went down instantly  i with himâ  he went down firstâ  he took the warming pan down in his hand to the dining roomâ  it was my custom to call the prisoner of a morningâ  he was never so short a time dressing as that morningâ  he was sometimes half an hour  sometimes threequarters  and sometimes an hourâ  the first room he went into was the dining room  and there he left the warming panâ  i did not hear him say any thing thenâ  he then went down stairs into his own pantryâ  there is a door near the pantry which opens into the back areaâ  i did not notice whether that was open or shutâ  he went into his pantryâ  i followed himâ  there is a cupboard there and drawers  they were all openâ  he made up to the drawers first  and said   my god  some one has been robbing us â  i said   let us go up stairs â  we both went up stairs  i think as far as the passage  and then i said   for god s sake let us go and see where his lordship is â  we went up stairsâ  he went firstâ  i followed him close behindâ  he went into his lordship s bed room by the cloth doorâ  the door closed upon me  but i had the handle in my hand  and went in immediately afterâ  when you go in at the door there are three windows fronting the street opposite the doorâ  the head of the bed is against the wall on the righthand as you go inâ  when i went in  the prisoner was opening the shutters of the middle windowâ  he would have to pass the foot of the bed to do thatâ  i went about half way to the middle of the bed  at the foot of the bed  and saw blood on the pillowâ  before i noticed the blood  i said   my lord  my lord â  the prisoner said   here he is    or  there he is    i am not certain which were the wordsâ  i cannot say whether that was before or after i saw the blood on the pillowâ  on seeing the blood i screamed and ran out of the roomâ  there were hangings to the bedâ  it was a four post bedsteadâ  the curtains were closed on the side next the door  and about half way at the foot  the same as i bad left them over nightâ  i left the prisoner in the room  and i think i ran part of the way up the attic stairs  and then i turned round  and ran down into the street q  had you any object in going up the attic stairs  a  i was going to my fellow servant the cook  when i thought i would give an alarm out in  the street  and my screams awoke herâ  i left the house by the street door  and went over to no  23  mr  latham s  and rang the bellâ  it is nearly oppositeâ  finding they did not come instantly  1âœ  rang the bell at no  22  mr  lloyd s  and the footman came up the area steps immediatelyâ  i do not know his nameâ  young  mr  latham s servant  came out while i was standing at the doorâ  i told him what had occurredâ  i had left the front door of the house open when i ran outâ  i was not gone many minutes  i merely crossed the street  rang these two bells  and came back againâ  when i came back to the house i think i met the cook at the bottom of the stairs in the passageâ  i am not positiveâ  i then went into the dining roomâ  i do not know whether she followed me or notâ  at that time no stranger had come into the houseâ  when i went into the dining room i found the prisoner sitting on a chair in the act of writingâ  he hadâœ  a pen in his hand and a small piece of paper lying on a large bookâ  he appeared to be writing on that small piece of paperâ  i said   what the devil do you sit here for  why don t you go out and see for some one  or a doctor    he said   i must write to mr  russell â  he did not continue writingâ  he only wrote about two wordsâ  i said   some one must go for mr  russell â  i knew him to mean the son of lord william russellâ  he lived at no  9  cheshunt place  belgrave squareâ  on my saying that  the prisoner got up and came to the street doorâ  a sort of labouring man was going past  and the prisoner beckoned to himâ  i told him not to call such a man as that  and the man went on about his businessâ  the coachman came a few minutes after  and young  mr  latham s servant  about the same timeâ  i think the coachman was in the house firstâ  the coachman and young went up stairsâ  i am not sure whether i went up with them  i am not positive sureâ  i do not know what i did at that momentâ  i think i didâ  i think the cook went to the bed room doorâ  i do not know where the prisoner wasâ  i heard young say something about fetching a doctorâ  i was on the stairsâ  i went down and was going to send some one for a doctor  when the coachman ran for mr  elsgood  a surgeon in the neighbourhoodâ  the police arrived a very few minutes after thatâ  i went up stairs when the police arrived  into the bed roomâ  when i went in i saw his lordship s face at that time  and i saw a quantity of bloodâ  i was in the habit of making the bedâ  his lordship usually laid on the side next the windowâ  there were two pillowsâ  they were usually put side by side  as if for two personsâ  the pillows were in that state when i saw them that morningâ  his lordship laid on his right side with his face towards the windowâ  he was lying with his head on the pillow  nearest the window  and the other pillow was lying behind himâ  it was on the pillow next the window  on which i first saw the blood when i went into the room with the prisonerâ  when i went up with the police i did not notice whether there was blood on the other pillowâ  there was a dressing table in the roomâ  it is the one on which lord russell used to put his pencil case and tooth pickâ  it had a white cloth on itâ  he generally used to leave his rings  which he wore daily  on the tableâ  they were fiveâ  i had frequently seen them there of a morningâ  his lordship would frequently go down to breakfast and leave them thereâ  there were no rings or toothpick  or pencil case there thenâ  they were all goneâ  there was a purse thereâ  i took it upâ  it was emptyâ  the police then took possession of the house  and have remained in it to the present time q  have you ever had conversation with the prisoner on the subject of money  a  yesâ  the last time was on the tuesday morning  the 5thâ  he said he had no money at home  he never took any out with him  and he had no money in the bankâ  i do not exactly remember what led to that conversationâ  he afterwards said he had 8l  some odd shillings in the bankâ  that was on the same day  in the same conversationâ  when he first said he had no money in the bank i did not make any observationâ  he said all the money he had then was 5l   when that was gone he must ask his lordship for some more  and that he had 8l  owing him on the books against his lordshipâ  nothing passed between the time of his saying he had no money in the bank and his saying that he had money in the bankâ  the cook was present q  do you remember whether any thing passed between you  after having first said he had no money  and then saying he had  a  i said to him   have you spent all that money i saw you take out   â  he said   yes â  i do not know how that conversation beganâ  it was at breakfastâ  i had seen him take some sovereigns out of his box when he came up into his bed room  and i was in my bed room  and he had some sovereigns in his hand  which he put into his waistcoat pocketâ  i cannot say whether this was on monday or tuesdayâ  that is what i meant by asking him what he had done with the money i had seen him take outâ   i do not know how many there were â  he said he had  for he had paid a tailor s billâ  this was on the tuesdayâ  it was his own tailor s bill q  which was mentioned first  having money in the bank  or paying his tailor s bill  a  having money in the bank was mentioned firstâ  i asked him what bankâ  he said in st  martin s laneâ  i believe there is a savings  bank thereâ  i told him that was the best bank he could put it inâ  i do not think he said any thing more at that timeâ  he said he was not so well off as when he first came to englandâ  i think he said that before that timeâ  he said it once before  and he said it again at tea time  when carr was there on the tuesday eveningâ  he said on the tuesday morning that he had but 5l court q  did he say where the 5l  was  a  no  he said he had but 5l mr  bodkin q  can you tell us whether he said he had but 5l  before or after he said he had the 8l  odd in the bank  a  i think it was before he said he had the 8l  in the bankâ  i never saw him in possession of any money of his own  but the sovereigns which i have mentionedâ  i never saw him with any bank note q  did he ever speak to you  or in your hearing  on the subject oflord william russell s property  a  yes  on two occasions  i heard speak of thatâ  the first occasion was before his lordship went to richmondâ  he said old billywas a rum old chap  and if he had his money he would not remain long in englandâ  i said his lordship was not a very rich manâ  he said   ah  old billyhas money  and if i had it i would not remain long in england â  the next occasion was before the tuesday  but i do not know how longâ  it was after he returned from richmondâ  that was on the same subjectâ  he said the same words as before q  do you mean to the same effect  or the same words  a  the same wordsâ  i was alone with the prisoner at supper the night before the murderâ  i had a glass of aleâ  he offered me a glass of something  which i tasted  but did not drinkâ  he drank the same ale i didâ  in the course of the day on the 6th  i asked the prisoner if he heard me knock at his doorâ  he said he thought he would begin to dressâ  he did not say whether he heard me or notâ  i have frequently seen the prisoner in his lordship s bed room q  did you notice any thing particular in his conduct at any time  a  yesâ  i did several timesâ  i noticed that he was  looking into all his lordship s property  and every thing that he couldâ  i asked him what he wanted in the rooms  and he told me he was looking after somethingâ  he has not told me whatâ  this was before he went to richmondâ  i cannot mention any article in particular  which he appeared to be looking atâ  on one occasion i noticed that he had his lordship s dressing case down in his pantry q  would it be his duty to have it down there to clean it or any thing  a  i never knew the other valet to have it downâ  i cannot tell any article that he was looking at when he was in his lordship s bed room  because his lordship used to carry the keys  and i never knew his lordship to leave any thing unlocked in the bed room  except his dressing caseâ  it was not only in one room that i saw him looking  but every roomâ  i do not know exactly what property his lordship hadâ  one day his lordship left his cash box unlockedâ  it was the day his lordship went to richmondâ  it was kept in his lordship s bed room  by the side of the bedâ  it was a little box his lordship always called his cash boxâ  it was covered with leatherâ  the prisoner brought it down  and said it was unlockedâ  his lordship was gone out for a walk at that timeâ  the prisoner brought it down into the dining room  because his lordship was going to richmond  and he always took it with himâ  his lordship burnt a rushlight at night in his roomâ  i set one up that nightâ  it was a whole rushlightâ  i left it unlit when i went to bedâ  i have since given one of the rushlights out of the same parcel to inspector beresford cross examined bymr  phillips q  you have been examined  i believe  several times before the magistrate  a  yesâ  i cannot recollect how many timesâ  it was three i believe  but i do not know how many timesâ  i was also examined before the coronerâ  i have not been examined by anybody since the committal of the prisoner  that i swearâ  not by mr  hoblerâ  this is not the first time i have said i saw the prisoner looking not only into one room  but into every room after his lordship s propertyâ  i said it before i ever went to bow street  to the solicitor who was there when first i was examined  i believe it was mr  hoblerâ  i also said it to my fellowservantâ  i have several times told what occurred  without mentioning that i saw him looking after the propertyâ  i gave evidence in the house oflord russell on the first or second day  i am not certain whichâ  i believe what i said was taken down in writingâ  i have no doubt that it wasâ  mr  mayne  the commissioner of police  was thereâ  there was no magistrate present to my knowledgeâ  i never saw himâ  there was no attorney there to my knowledgeâ  i did not see anyâ  there were only two persons  mr  hobler and mr  mayneâ  i did not know mr  hobler was the attorneyâ  i did not know that was the nameâ  the prisoner was not presentâ  when i first went into his lordship s room with the prisoner  i said   my lord  my lord    and saw some blood on the pillow  and ran away screamingâ  i did not see his lordship on that occasion q  now  attend to me  on the oath you have taken  have you never said   i saw my lord murdered in the bed    a  no  sir  i never didâ  i never said his lordship was murdered  the first timeâ  i did not see his lordship when i first went in with the prisonerâ  i never said i did  to my recollectionâ  i really was that frightened  i do not know what i said at the momentâ  i know what i said in the room q  but did you ever represent that when you went the first time into the bed room with courvoisier  you saw my lord murdered in the bed  a  i saw bloodâ  i did not know whether he was murderedâ  i never said that i saw him murdered in the bedâ  i am sure i never didâ  i did not see his lordship the first time q  i am asking what you said  if you said that  on the first occasion when you went in with courvoisier  you saw his lordship murdered in the bed  would that be true or not  a  i do not know whether i said murdered or killedâ  i think i said something to my fellow servantâ  i think it was  killed â  she says i said either murdered or killed q  i am talking of the time you went in with courvoisier  did you represent to any body that  on the first view of the bed on that occasion  you saw my lord murdered in the bed  a  noâ  i do not think i said itâ  i could not say that  because i never saw my lord thenâ  i did not represent that i did  to my beliefâ  i did not  to my knowledgeâ  i cannot say whether i did or notâ  when i first went in i saw blood on the end of the pillowâ  i said   my lord  my lord    and ran screaming out of the room court q  in giving an account of this afterwards to some other person  was the expression you used that you had seen my lord murdered in his bed  meaning lying in his bed murdered  is that what you said  a  noâ  i recollect it now  i said some one had murdered his lordshipâ  i said it in the street to young mr  phillips q  i am not asking what you said in the street  i ask you this  did you ever say that the first time you went into the room you saw him murdered in the bed  a  noâ  i am sure of thatâ  i was examined before the coronerâ  to the best of my recollection  i have always given the same account of what i saw in the room on the first occasion  as i have given to dayâ  it is a thing which impresses itself on my mindâ  i was that frightened  i do not remember what i sawâ  on the second occasion i went in with inspector tedman  and saw his lordship s faceâ  i did not go up to the side of the bed  i went to about the middle of the foot of the bed  i then saw saw his lordship s faceâ  tedman went up before meâ  i followed him instantlyâ  i was in the room the same time as he wasâ  i did not see him go into the bed roomâ  i was further down the stairsâ  i followed up quicklyâ  i did not see tedman do any thing to my lordâ  on going down into the passage i saw several things lying thereâ  i saw the napkinâ  i didnot look into the folds of that napkin thenâ  i never represented that i did at that timeâ  there were two or three policemen present when i saw the napkin the second timeâ  i do not know whether tedman was up or down stairsâ  when i went up to the cook  after having seen the things tossed about  i asked her if she knew if any thing had been the matter last nightâ  she said  no â  the expression i used to courvoisier was   courvoisier  do you know if any thing has been the matter last night   q  the same words as you used to the cook  a  she told me to call himâ  those were the words i used to the cook q  pray  had you the least doubt that a great deal was the matter  a  no  i had no doubt at allâ  i did not think there was any thing the matterâ  not so much the matter as there was  because i had frequently seen his lordship s papers strewed about  much the same as they were that morningâ  i never before found the passage strewed with things q  had you any doubt then of any thing being the matter  i did not know what to thinkâ  i thought there might be something the matterâ  i did not know whether the cook could give me any informationâ  she was up later than me by a quarter of an hourâ  i did not think she could know all this in a quarter of an hour q  why ask her  a  because i had nobody else to go toâ  i did not know what to think when i saw the things in the passageâ  it surprised me very muchâ  i went immediately up to the cook  and told her what i had seenâ  i went into the parlour first q  why not instantly go up when you saw the things in the drawingroom and in the passage  a  i did not know what the things were laid there forâ  i knew nothing about itâ  i did not go into the parlour before i went up to herâ  i went up to the door to see the thingsâ  i did not examine the street doorâ  i could see it from the bottom of the stairsâ  i went to it to see what the things were q  were you not surprised to find it unchained and unbolted  a  i sometimes have found it unfastened beforeâ  i cannot say exactly how long beforeâ  it might be before his lordship went to richmondâ  once courvoisier had forgotten to fasten itâ  that surprised meâ  i do not know whether i mentioned that to the cook or notâ  it was only once before that i had seen it unfastenedâ  i was surprised at seeing the things strewed about the passage  but i was not so much alarmed till i went into the parlour  i then became more alarmedâ  i just opened the shutterâ  i went into the drawing room to pen the shutters  not to see if property was thereâ  i did not suspect any thing when i went into the front drawing room q  although you had seen the desk twisted round  the drawers open  and the papers sticking out  you never suspected any thing wrong  a  no  i did not q  now it has been opened to us to day that courvoisier never took the least trouble to give any assistance  if i remember right  you told me that the prisoner appeared to be writing  and said he was writing to mr  william russell  a  he said he must write to mr  russellâ  i said  somebody must be sent for him q  and after that  he was about to send the first man he saw at the door  a  not that i know ofâ  he beckoned to the manâ  he had sat about five minutes after i told him mr  russell must be sent forâ  when he beckoned to the man  i gave him a push  and said   don t call such a man as that â  i did not know what he was calling him for q  what did you mean by saying   do not send such a man as that   a  because he did not look like a man to send any whereâ  i did not think the prisoner was going to send him for mr  russellâ  he was not a man i should send any where q  if you found a house robbed  and a murder committed  should you not send the first person you could find  a  i do not know whether i should or notâ  i did not see his lordship when i first went into the room with courvoisierâ  i am not certain whether i ever said i saw blood on the pillow  but could not tell whether i saw his lordshipâ  i never said   i did see his lordship the first time â  i did not see himâ  i never said   i was not sure whether i did or not â  i had been living at mivart s hotelâ  lord william was stopping there a short time  not living thereâ  he was there about a fortnightâ  i left mivart s after his lordship went awayâ  i do not know how soon after  it might be a fortnight  or it might be moreâ  i did not go into any service after leaving mivart sâ  i went into lodgings for two monthsâ  i then went into lord william s serviceâ  it was at mr  don s  no  9  upper john street  or lower john street  golden square  where i lodged q  you have stated you took some ale from the prisoner  did you ever say you grew quite drowsy  a  yesâ  i was not asked the question to day  i felt quite drowsy afterwards  not immediatelyâ  i felt sleepy and drowsyâ  i feel drowsy of a night  but i felt drowsier that night  after taking the aleâ  i do not say it was the aleâ  i do not know whether it was the ale or what it wasâ  the prisoner took some of itâ  i was sitting there about threequarters of an hourâ  just before i went to bed i became drowsyâ  i did not become so very shortly after taking the aleâ  it might be half  or three quarters of an hourâ  it might be very shortlyâ  i cannot say exactly the time q  do i state your sensations truly when i describe them in this way   i felt very heavy and sleepy  and felt a drowsy sensation come over me very shortly after taking the ale    a  yesâ  it might be the ale that made me soâ  i did not mean to convey to the jury that he gave me drugged aleâ  i never tasted any thing particular in the aleâ  i did not mean to insinuate that it was drugged aleâ  i mentioned it merely as a matter of courseâ  i never meant to insinuate it was the ale made me soâ  i was dreadfully frightened after i found that his lordship was murderedâ  it was after that that i said to the prisoner   what the devil are you doing there   â  i am not in the habit of speaking so  but i did not know what i was aboutâ  i observed what he was aboutâ  i should not have said that  had he got up and assisted meâ  i think it was quite right to apprize mr  william russell immediately of the horrid event that had happenedâ  belgrave square is not very far for a man to ride on horsebackâ  the coachman might have goneâ  courvoisier might have gone for the coachman q  and might he not have taken the opportunity of escaping  if he was conscious of any crime  a  he might have escapedâ  our sleeping room is divided from courvoisier s by a wallâ  i do not know whether it is lath and plasterâ  it is not very thick  and not very thinâ  i have knocked my hand against itâ  i do not know that it is hollowâ  i did not knock against it for any thing particularâ  i did not notice a hollow sound that i know ofâ  when i went down with courvoisier  and saw the things tossed about  i said   let us go and see where his lordship is  q  did you think any thing was the matter with my lord then  a  i did not know what to thinkâ  he was unprotected  and nobody went to seeâ  i found my fellow servants safe q  why did you not use the expression   let us go and tell his lordship the house is robbed    instead of saying   let us go and see where his lordship is    a  those were the words i usedâ  i expected to find him in his bed roomâ  i did not know whether he was in his bed room  or notâ  it is a small houseâ  i had been into every room except the kitchenâ  i had not been into his lordship s bed room thenâ  i did not know where he wasâ  i did not expect any mischief was done to him at that timeâ  i was anxious to see where he wasâ  i had no doubt where he wasâ  i believe there has been a great deal of inquiry and search made all about the premisesâ  i saw a ladder on the premisesâ  it has been there ever since i have been in the houseâ  it was there before i went into itâ  all the police saw it  and knew it was thereâ  i heard inspector tedman inquiring about the ladderâ  i do not know that he mentioned it at any investigationâ  i heard him mention it  but not at the investigationâ  i did not mention that there was a ladder on the premisesâ  i heard many inquiries as to how any body could have got over the walls q  is not that ladder exactly the height of the wall which separates the yard of the premises from another  a  i never noticed itâ  the ladder was not always kept in the yardâ  when it was not there it was kept in the bath room  which goes off from the houseâ  i cannot tell how high that wall isâ  i have been in the yard hundreds of timesâ  i have no idea how high the wall isâ  i have gone up that ladder  but not in the yardâ  i have had it in the houseâ  i do not know the height of itâ  it is the height of other laddersâ  i do not know whether a person on that ladder could get over the sidewallâ  i never saw the ladder standing there before the morning of the murderâ  i did not see it till the police saw itâ  it was standing in the passage on the tuesday  and i asked courvoisier to take it away  and he took it and placed it there himselfâ  i remember that nowâ  it stood inside when i asked him to take itâ  it was in the passage just below three stairsâ  i was cleaning the passage  and said to courvoisier   will you take this away    and he took it out there court q  standing in the house  a  yesâ  it had been left there on mondayâ  the late valet had been there hanging some pictures for his lordship  and left it thereâ  i asked courvoisier to take it away  and he took it away  took it out of the house  on tuesdayâ  he set it where it was found by the police  on the side of the wall of no  15  the left hand side mr  phillips q  did you desire courvoisier to put it there  a  no  i desired him to take it awayâ  i saw where he took it toâ  it did not surprise me in the least next morning  court q  did it reach to the top of the wall  a  not exactly  that i knowâ  i never noticed itâ  it stood quite upright mr  phillips q  was it leaning against the wall  a  it must be leaning against the wallâ  i did not see it for a long time afterâ  i saw it in the course of the day leaning against the wallâ  i do not know how far it was from the top of the wallâ  any body on the top of that could easily have got over the wall q  now  you were in the house ever since this unhappy event took place  have you seen any people trying chisels  pokers  and instruments of all description  against the doors and wainscoting  a  noâ   looking at the model â  this is the glass door leading into the yardâ  i do not know of any experiment being made on that door and door post since the policecame into the houseâ  i had not observed any marks on that door before the police came into the houseâ  that is the door through which i have gone scores of hundred of times into the yardâ  i never noticed any marks on that doorâ  i believe i first mentioned about the prisoner giving me the ale at the last examination  but i really do not knowâ  i was never in the house before i went into his lordship s serviceâ  i never was in the street beforeâ  i had not looked out for a situation while at mr  don s q  you preferred living on your means  a  no  i did not  i was doing the servant s work in the houseâ  mr  don kept two servants q  i thought you mentioned it as a lodging  a  it was a lodging when i first went there  but the servant went away  and i did the work of that servant  because i would not be spending my own moneyâ  i was  it might be  about a month at don s before the servant went away  but i do not knowâ  i did not hear of a situation in that monthâ  i inquired of people coming to the house  and the servants in the house asked the tradespeople about a situation for meâ  i did not go myselfâ  mr  don is a tailorâ  i had never seen the waterloo medal but once beforeâ  i saw it then on the table in his lordship s bed roomâ  he had emptied a little boxâ  his lordship never kept his bed room door locked q  how did you find out that my lord wanted a servant  a  when i left mivart s hotel i asked the head waiter if he heard of a light place to let me know  he said he would  and when his lordship came from abroad he sent for me by one of the men out of the stableâ  i never  to my recollection  heard courvoisier mention the wages he had at mr  fector sâ  he had not so much at his lordship s by 5l  as the late valetâ  i do not know what his wages wereâ  i do not know that it was 45l  a yearâ  he told me it was 5l  less than the late valet hadâ  i did not hear him say he had double the wages he had at mr  fector sâ  he told me had no money in the bank  and then said he had 8l q  when you said to courvoisier   let us go and see where his lordship is    did he not say to you   what will he say    a  no  i did not hear him say any thingâ  i cannot swear he did notâ  i never heard him say any thing at that timeâ  i can swear i never heard him say thatâ  i do not recollect hearing him say any thing when he was going into the diningroomâ  i never heard himâ  i did not see the area gate at all after the prisoner went out for the beer for the cook mr  bodkin q  you have been asked about some examination of persons in the house in the presence of mr  mayne and mr  hobler  on what day was that  a  i do not recollect the dayâ  it was not the day of the murderâ  i was examined in the absence of the prisonerâ  the prisoner also went into the room to be examined in my absenceâ  the other servants were examined separately in the same wayâ  we were all kept separate from each otherâ  no one had been at that time charged with  or accused of this offence  to my knowledgeâ  when i went up into the bed room with tedman the door was opened by the men that went up stairsâ  the door had not closed after them before i went inâ  it remained openâ  i do not know how near i was to the room when tedman went inâ  i was part of the way down stairsâ  when i went into the room tedman was round by the side of the bed against the window  near his lordship s headâ  young and some other persons had been up in the room before i went up with tedmanâ  i had seen the waterloo medal about three months before his lordship s deathâ  his lordship was in the room when i saw itâ  it was lying openâ  i never in my life had any quarrel or cause of quarrel with the prisoner mary haell i was cook in the late lord william russell s service for two years and nine monthsâ  his lordship dined at home on the 5th of mayâ  after dinner i washed the plateâ  i went out a little before nine o clock  and returned a little before tenâ  i went out alone and returned aloneâ  courvoisier let roe in at the front door  and he fastened the door when i came inâ  he locked  bolted  and chained itâ  i went down stairs into the kitchenâ  i did not go out of the house after that timeâ  before i went out at nine o clock  i went into the yard to fetch the cold meat in for supper  and i bolted the door after meâ  the cold meat was kept in a safe in the lower yardâ  the door i bolted was the one which leads from the passage close to the pantry  into the lower yardâ  there were two bolts to that door  one at the top and the other at the bottomâ  i do not think i bolted the bottom bolt  because it was out of repairâ  i had not been in the habit of bolting that bottom bolt of lateâ  on my return home i had my supper in the kitchenâ  courvoisier and manser had already suppedâ  manser went to bed firstâ  before i went to bed courvoisier went out and fetched me some beerâ  he went out by the area gateâ  i did not notice where he put the key of the area gate on his returnâ  it usually hung up in the kitchenâ  he had taken it to let himself out of the area gate  but i did not notice on his return whether it was put there againâ  i went up to bed about half past ten o clockâ  the prisoner did not remain in the kitchen till i went up stain to bedâ  he was in the pantry when i went to bedâ  he had not been very long in the pantry before i went to bed  only a few minutesâ  he had been up stairs while i was at supperâ  he went up stairs to the drawing room as the bell rungâ  when i got up stairs into my bed room manser was in bed q  did she to your knowledge leave  the room in the course of that night  a  no  i do not believe she didâ  i did not leave it at allâ  i was not disturbed at all in the night by any noise  or any thing out of the common wayâ  manser got up first next morningâ  i think it was about a quarter to seven when she went down stainâ  i was still in bedâ  she generally used to knock at the prisoner s door as she went downâ  i heard her do so that morning as she went downâ  she came up stairs again in about five minutes and made a communication to meâ  i immediately got upâ  before i got up she went again to courvoisier s door  and i heard them both go down stairsâ  whilst i was dressing i heard the housemaid scream  and on hearing that i finished dressing and ran down stairsâ  i ran to the lower part  near the dining roomâ  i saw manser thereâ  she said his lordship was killedâ  i just went into the front dining roomâ  i saw the prisoner and manser thereâ  the prisoner had got a slip of paper and a pen  and was writing something on a bookâ  i then went to the front doorâ  in the course of the morning i saw the prisoner in the back diningroomâ  it was a few minutes after i had seen him in the front dining roomâ  he was sitting in a chair by the middle doorâ  he said   oh dear  they will think it is me  and i shall never get a place again â  when i came down i saw some things lying about in the passageâ  there was his lordship s cloak  an opera glass  and trinket boxâ  i saw a bundle in the passage by the cloak  tied up with a dinner napkinâ  the contents of that bundle were not taken out before the police cameâ  i had left a thimble of mine the night before in a work box in a cupboard in the kitchenâ  that cupboard is on the right hand as you face the streetâ  in the morning when i went into the kitchen  i found the cupboards and drawers all openâ  therewas nothing taken away that i am aware of  except that thimbleâ  there was nothing of any value in the cupboardâ  i do not know how it had been openedâ  there was no force usedâ  the lock was shotâ  i think it could be opened easilyâ  i could not open it when it was lockedâ  this is it  looking at the plan  there are two or three doors to itâ  i did not observe any marks of violence  but the lock was turned  not unlockedâ  the bolt was shotâ  i had locked that cupboard myself the night before  and taken the key up stairsâ  there is a little bolt on one side as well as the lockâ  i could not be positive that i put that bolt down  i think i didâ  two of the dresser drawers were open  all out of order  and rummagedâ  they had not been lockedâ  i left a fire in the kitchen  the night before  when i went to bedâ  i left the prisoner up  he was to supply it  in case any thing was wantedâ  his lordship always had his bed warmedâ  i left coals to feed it with q  do you recollect ever having any conversation with the prisoner about money  a  on the tuesday morning at breakfast he said he had only 5l   and when that was gone he must ask his lordship for moreâ  there was something else said  but i cannot recollectâ  i heard the prisoner say once that old billywas a rum old chap  and if he had his money he would not be long in englandâ  that was all i heard him sayâ  i cannot recollect when that was  exactlyâ  it was about a week beforeâ  it was in the kitchenâ  we were at one meal  i cannot recollect whichâ  the prisoner and the other servants lived comfortably together  we never had a word with himâ  i was going to leave the serviceâ  that was not on account of any quarrel with the prisoner cross examined bymr  clarkson q  the prisoner  and you  and the others lived comfortably and peaceably together  a  yes  we never had any quarrel  because we had no reasonâ  when he said that about my lord  i only thought he said it as a jokeâ  he said if he had as much money as old billyhe would not remain in englandâ  he is a swissâ  i do not know whether it was his lordship s custom to give him money for the weekly or monthly supplyâ  he has not paid bills  except for his lordshipâ  he said something about money in the bankâ  that was when he said he had only 5l   and when that was gone he must ask his lordship for moreâ  he said something about having 8l  in the bank q  the 5l  did not refer to all he had in the world  but to what he had for the expenses of the house  a  i did not properly understand himâ  he said something about the bankâ  i did not give more than 18d  or 2s  for the thimbleâ  i had had it a very long time  before i went into my lord s serviceâ  there was a step ladder in the yardâ  it used not to be kept there lately  i thinkâ  i believe it had been in the bath room  except a day or two previous to what happenedâ  it is not a ladder  but steps  which open with a string from one end to the other  and stand by themselvesâ  i think it is six or seven feet highâ  i saw that ladder the following morning  after his lordship s deathâ  it stood in the yard  just outside the glass door of the upper yard  and against the wallâ  it was not quite so high as the wallâ  there would be no difficulty  in a person who was at the top of that ladder  putting his foot over to the lead at the topâ  i do not know whether the prisoner sat in a good many places in the course of that dayâ  the back dining room was the place i saw him in q  how soon after your fellow servant gave an alarm on the opposite side of the way  was it before the coachman and groom came into the house  a  the coachman came first some timeâ  i think it was five or ten minutesbefore he cameâ  i do not know who gave the order for mr  william russell to be sent forâ  i do not know whether it was the prisonerâ  i do not know who sentâ  the ostler of mr  shenton  a neighbour  wentâ  that was after i saw courvoisier sitting in the back dining roomâ  i saw him in the back dining room before any body was sent for mr  wm  russellâ  it was a minute or two either wayâ  i do not know who went for the man that went for mr  russellâ  i was very much alarmed and agitatedâ  i hardly knew what i did q  would you not as soon have sent the first man you met in the street  as have sent the ostler  a  no  we knew the manâ  he came to the door  and knowing him  somebody asked him to go q  we understand your bed comes the right side of it  flush on the lath and plaster of the division between your bed room and the prisoner s  a  yes  it is a thin partitionâ  i never examined itâ  i cannot say whether i could hear him turn in his bedâ  i could hear him in his room  if he moved a chair or any thingâ  if he had been walking about in his shoes  and i was awake  i should have heard himâ  i should hear him cough and blow his nose  if i was awakeâ  i was awake when manser got up at a quarter before seven o clockâ  i heard her go outâ  it might be about half past six o clock when she got out of bedâ  i had not spoken to her before or after she got out of bedâ  there was no conversationâ  i had not spoken to herâ  i do not recollect her speaking before she went out of the roomâ  she was about a quarter of an hour dressingâ  she washes up stairsâ  i cannot recollect whether she washed herself that morningâ  i cannot say whether she did or notâ  that was about the time she usually got upâ  the prisoner used to wash and shave himself belowâ  he sometimes was longer dressing than at other times q  you say he said   oh dear  they will think it is me  and i shall never get another place    did that strike you as being a natural expression for a man under such circumstances  a  i thought it seemed strange  but he was alarmed  and i thought at the time he did not know what he was sayingâ  he seemed as confused and agitated as the rest of usâ  there was nothing in his appearance to lead me to suppose more than that he was alarmed and agitatedâ  when manser came up stairs after being below  she described to me what she had seenâ  she did not tell me what she had seen in the folds of the napkin thenâ  i came down and saw themâ  i saw a gold pencil and tortoiseshell toothpickâ  i saw them when i first went into the passageâ  i saw the bundle lying  but did not untie itâ  i saw the pencil case and toothpick lying in the foldsâ  that was five or ten minutes before the policemen cameâ  i think manser was with me at the timeâ  i believe she observed them  and pointed out the thingsâ  i cannot positively say whether she spoke about the pencil case and toothpick in the folds of the napkin  or whether i saw them myselfâ  i cannot say whether she repeated the words  but i saw them thereâ  i cannot tell whether she pointed them out to me  or i to herâ  i observed the bundle lying in the passage  and the cloak  and the pencil case and toothpick case in the folds of the napkinâ  i recollect seeing themâ  they might be seen by a person going to the spot without meddling with them at allâ  i did not see my lord s rings foundâ  i had seen his lordship wear ringsâ  they were much more valuable than my thimbleâ  there is some plate which i believe has not been foundâ  i believe there is a reward offered for someâ  i know there are silver forks and spoonswhich have been advertised and never been foundâ  i do not know how many piecesâ  i have heard there are forks and spoons among the missing plate mr  chambers q  do you know at all how much is missing  a  noâ  the pencil case and toothpick were in the folds of the napkin  outside  lying on itâ  mr  shenton is a livery stable keeperâ  his lordship kept his horses at livery thereâ  the pencil case and toothpick were visible for any body to see that came downâ  i am not aware of the prisoner s paying any of lord russell s billsâ  he might have paid small bills if his lordship gave ordersâ  i was to pay the household bills after ellis left  but none of the household bills were paid after ellis left  because i have got the books court q  you said the prisoner took the key in order to get out by the area  do you mean the key of the door of the house leading into the area  or the key of the area gate  a  the area gateâ  the area door was bolted and barredâ  i left it bolted and barred that nightâ  that was after he came in with the aleâ  i bolted and barred it myself after he came inâ  it was not necessary to open that door to let him in with the aleâ  the housemaid and i were in the kitchen while he was gone for the aleâ  the door i speak of goes out of the kitchen into the area  not out of any passageâ  i do not remember whether the key of the area gate was brought back to the place where it usually hung william york i was coachman to the late lord william russell  i lived out of the houseâ  i should have been in his lordship s service four years on the 6th of juneâ  there was also a groomâ  he lived out of the houseâ  on the 5th of may i went to his lordship to see him  at half past eleven o clockâ  i saw himâ  nothing particular passed between us thenâ  i went to the house again at half past two o clock  but did not see his lordshipâ  i had no directions from the prisoner about going to brooks sâ  i went to the house again about ten minutes after five o clockâ  courvoisier and the two female servants were at teaâ  courvoisier said to me   you should have been at brooks s at five o clock  but i forgot to order you  you had better go directly â  i went directlyâ  his lordship had gone when i got thereâ  his lordship had some explanation with me  and i told him i had gone according to orderâ  on the following morning  when i was dressing myself  a little before seven o clock  a report came to my lodging  in consequence of which i went to his lordship s houseâ  i got there a few minutes after seven o clock  and saw the cook  the housemaid  and young  the butler  from no  23â  i did not see the prisoner at that timeâ  young and i went up stairs to his lordship s bed roomâ  young went to the bedside next to the window  and uncovered the sheetâ  i perceived blood on the pillow  and on the sheet likewiseâ  i did not see his lordship s face when the sheet was pulled asideâ  the face was covered up with a cloth or towel of some kindâ  i stood at the foot of the bed a few minutesâ  the police entered the roomâ  inspector tedman came into the room  and the police with him  or a few minutes laterâ  that was after i had seen the sheet pulled aside  and the blood on the pillowâ  tedman and the police came in while i was at the foot of the bedâ  in consequence of what was said i went for a surgeon immediatelyâ  i went to mr  elsgood  at the corner of park street and grosvenor street  and brought him to his lordship s houseâ  on my return to his lordship s room  i saw the prisoner behind the bed room door sitting downâ  his face was covered with his handsâ  he said o my god  what shall i do   â  i saw him again about half an hour afterwards  down stairs emanuel young i am butler to mr  latham  of no  28  norfolk street  park lane  on the morning of the 16th of may i heard the house bell ring about seven o clockâ  i went up and found manser on the opposite sideâ  she told me something that had happenedâ  i went to lord russell s houseâ  she told me to go for the policeâ  i returned in about five minutesâ  york  the coachman  came very soon afterâ  he and i proceeded up stairs to lord russell s bed roomâ  i believe york went into the room firstâ  we went in nearly togetherâ  the shutters of the middle window were openâ  i noticed blood on the bedâ  as i was standing at the foot of the bed i saw the blood on the bolster  on the towel  and also on the sheetâ  the towel was covering his lordship s faceâ  i then went to the side of the bed nearest the window  and turned down the sheet of the bedâ  i did not take the towel from his faceâ  i had no opportunity of seeing whether there was any wound on his lordshipâ  the prisoner came into the room shortly afterwardsâ  at that time the head of lord russell was still covered with the towelâ  his right hand was in a bending positionâ  i saw that on moving the sheet q  you had ascertained  i suppose  by observation  that he was then quite dead  a  the housemaid told me his lordship was murdered  and the house was robbed  beforeâ  i felt his hand when i turned down the sheetâ  it was quite coldâ  i did not observe any weapon or instrument on the bed or near the body of lord russell court q  when had the housemaid told you that his lordship was murdered  and the house robbed  a  at the time i crossed the road  before i came to the houseâ  i saw the napkin taken off his lordship by mr  elsgood  the surgeon  afterwards mr  bodkin q  do you remember the particular phrase she used  was it the word  murdered    a  i believe it wasâ  the prisoner came to the foot of the bed while i was in the roomâ  he raised his hand  and instantly fell back into an arm chairâ  he said   what shall we do   â  he appeared to be very much distressed at the timeâ  i cannot say how long he remained in the arm chair  but it was some timeâ  it might be ten minutes  or it might be a quarter of an hourâ  he constantly kept saying   what shall we do   â  at the end of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour he rose up from the chair  went to a small table in the room  and began to examine a small dressing caseâ  he took off the top  and also took out the inner part  and put the inner part into a cupboard  very quickly  by the side of the fire placeâ  by the inner part i mean a kind of tray which lifts outâ  it contained several articlesâ  he came back with the dressing case after shutting the cupboard door  and with his hand he removed the rings  which i saw at the bottom of the dressing case which was under the trayâ  i saw four ringsâ  he removed them with his hand at the bottom of the dressing caseâ  i left the prisoner at that momentâ  during the time he was moving these things he spoke to me about his placeâ  he said   i have lived with his lordship only five weeks  and what shall i do for my character   â  i did not make any observation to him on that  to my knowledgeâ  he did not interfere with any other article in the room in my sightâ  he said such and such things were missing  but i do not know whatâ  he mentioned several things that were missingâ  i remember his saying rings were missing  and likewise his lordship s watch and pinsâ  i did not go out of the room when i left himâ  i assisted mr  elsgood  who had come before thatâ  he cameinto the room before the prisonerâ  i assisted mr  elsgood in examining the bodyâ  i noticed a rushlight in the roomâ  i cannot tell the length of it when it was placed up  but it appeared to have been burning a short time  i may say an hourâ  inspector tedman came in while i was thereâ  after that i went down to the lower part of the houseâ  the prisoner went with meâ  he did not say any thing to me till we got to the bottom of the houseâ  he then said   oh  here is where they came in â  he pointed to the place where i was standing at the foot of the staircase leading to the basementâ  i could see the door which goes into the back area from where i was  and so could heâ  that door was openâ  i went and examined the door  but not with any great particularity thenâ  the prisoner went to it firstâ  it was not standing wide open  but it was openâ  the prisoner took it in his left hand  opened it still wider  and said   here is where they came in  cross examined bymr  phillips q  you say the prisoner fell back into a chair  a  he didâ  i had an opportunity of seeing my lord s neck and face when it was uncovered q  was it not a spectacle to utterly shock and horrify any body who saw it  a  it was very horrifying  so much so as to affect the nerves of the stoutest  strongest manâ  it certainly affected meâ  i was not unnervedâ  my nerves were shaken  but i was not unnervedâ  i did not see tedman at the door where the prisoner said they had got inâ  i left him up stairsâ  i found a silver candlestick in the bed room  near his lordship s bed sideâ  i examined it  and ascertained that it was silver by the stampâ  i judged by the appearance of the rushlight that it had been burning about an hourâ  i have been in the habit of seeing rushlights lighted and burntâ  it had not burnt out entirelyâ  it appeared to have been blown outâ  i judged it had been burning about an hour  from what was left mr  bodkin q  at the time the prisoner came to the foot of the bed  and fell back in the chair  was the upper part of the body uncovered  so as to expose the wound  a  it wasâ  mr  elsgood had uncovered it before the prisoner had come into the roomâ  the candlestick was standing by the side of the bed  on a small book case  between the two windowsâ  it was as near to the head of the bed as it could possibly stand  being on the bookcaseâ  there was an article of furniture immediately adjoining the head of the bedâ  it was not on that  but on the book case between the two windows henry elsgood i am a surgeon  and reside at no  14  upper brook street  grosvenor square  i was called to the house of the late lord william russell on the morning of the 6th of mayâ  i got there about half past seven o clockâ  i went up into the bed room immediatelyâ  i found him in bedâ  the body was then covered upâ  the clothes were over the body  as usual with a person lying in bed  and the towel was over the faceâ  i turned the clothes down and removed the towel from his lordship s faceâ  when i had done that i observed the body to be lying on the back  partly on the right side  slightly inclined on the right sideâ  there was some blood on the sheet which was turned over  and on the pillow  and also on the towel which was over the faceâ  when i turned the clothes down  and removed the towel  the shirt collar was wide open  and there was a sort of worsted network comforter  over the chest  drawn up to the chinâ  i was obliged to divide that comforter before i could see the woundâ  when i had done that i found the wound extended from the top of the left shoulder round to the part called the tracheaâ  it went round to theright side of the trachea  dividing the throatâ  that wound was decidedly sufficient to destroy life  and immediatelyâ  at the commencement it was about four or five inches deep  and at the termination  i should say  about threeâ  it was made with one incision  i should say  decidedly  and with very great force  by the parts that were dividedâ  it was a wound that might have been made with a knife or some such instrumentâ  i have not been shown any knives that were down stairs q  having observed the body  and the situation in which his lordship was lying  and the nature of the wound  in your judgment was it possible he could have inflicted it himself  a  decidedly notâ  utterly impossibleâ  there was no knife  nor any instrument near his lordship whateverâ  i had never attended lord william russellâ  i had known him by sight for some timeâ  i examined the body again on the friday evening  and saw that the ball of the thumb of the right hand was nearly cut off  and there was a small incision below thatâ  when i first uncovered the body the left hand gripped the sheetâ  it had a firm hold of itâ  there would be a great gush of blood from such a wound from the artery  to the leftâ  i did not observe any appearance indicating that that had taken place q  was there any thing to show how that could have been prevented  a  there was a pillow at the left side of the bed  down by his lordship s head  which was saturated with blood  which induced me to say that had been usedâ  not the pillow on which he was lyingâ  it was at the corner  lying by his sideâ  the corner down by his head had blood on it q  how could that have been used to prevent the gush of blood  a  it might have been held directly over the mouth of the vessel  directly the artery was dividedâ  the blood which had flowed from the wound had run through the bed and on to the floor of the room cross examined bymr  phillips q  did you observe whether there was any thing on the counterpane  i do not mean any mark  did you observe the miniature of a lady  a  there was a miniature there  i believe  which tedman told me ofâ  i do not recollect seeing it at allâ  tedman had got there before me john nursey i am an apothecary  and live in cleveland row  st  james s  i was accustomed to be the medical attendant of the late lord william russell for many yearsâ  he was about seventy three years of ageâ  he had suffered from frequent diseases  and from asthma especially  and he was of a spare and feeble habit of body in consequence of that diseaseâ  on the morning of the 6th of may i was called to his lordship s house in park lane  and found mr  elsgood thereâ  i examined the woundâ  i have heard mr  elsgood s evidenceâ  i agree with him as to what he states about the wound being the cause of death  and being given by a sharp instrument with great strengthâ  i could see entirely into the wound almost from one extremity to the otherâ  i could not see behind  but i felt behind  and felt the boneâ  after examining the wound i felt interested as to what i saw  and requested those present to place every thing in the situation in which it was first foundâ  tedman  courvoisier  and other persons were presentâ  i requested them to place the things as they were at the time of the discoveryâ  they did soâ  courvoisier assisted in doing itâ  i entirely agree with mr  elsgood that it was impossible lord william could have inflicted that wound upon himselfâ  i have seen some of the knives in the house  the poultry carving knife particularlyâ  they were exactly such instruments as would have inflicted such a wound cross examined bymr  phillips q  i suppose a razor or any sharp instrument would have done it  a  any sharp instrument would have done it mr  adolphus q  do you mean  a razor would inflict a wound of that depth and length at one blow  a  i think it possible thomas selway i am servant to mr  cutler  who lives at no  15  the adjoining house to the late lord william russell s  on the north side  towards oxford street  i went into the house on the morning of the 6th of may  about seven o clock  hearing screamsâ  i first heard screaming up stairs  as i was dressing  then i came down and heard screaming at the front doorâ  i made inquiryâ  it was stated what had occurred  and i went into the house q  did you hear the screaming up stairs in the house  or were you up stairs when you heard it  a  i was up stairsâ  the screaming appeared to me to come from lord russell s houseâ  from the atticsâ  i did not hear screams from any other part of the house until i came down  stairsâ  the screaming then appeared to come from the front doorâ  when i went in i observed the housemaid and the cook in the passageâ  i saw a cloak  an opera glass  and some other things lying in the passage  behind the front doorâ  i then went into the dining roomâ  i found the prisoner there aloneâ  he was sitting between the door and the windowâ  he was not doing any thing q  did you speak to him  or he to you  a  i cannot recollect correctly  only i remember he asked me to go down to no  100  park street  to ask the butler to come upâ  i do not know who lives at no  100  parkstreetâ  he did not say who the butler wasâ  he appeared to be in a very agitated state indeedâ  he got up from his seat to speak to meâ  nothing more passed between us that i recollectâ  soon after that  two of the policemen came inâ  i then left the house  and returned to my master sâ   looking at the model â  this wall separates the yard of lord russell s house from the yard behind my master s house  in connexion with that leadâ  directly i returned to my master s house  i went to the back drawingroom window  which enabled me to look on this flatâ  this is the wall behind lord russell s houseâ  it continues on behind my master s houseâ  the lead flat was very dusty indeedâ  i should say the lead is from three to four feet wideâ  it covers a flight of steps from my master s house court q  it is a lead flat which is let into the wall  and coven a flight of steps  a  yes mr  bodkin q  did you observe any marks on the dust which was lying on the lead flat  a  i did notâ  i looked distinctly for that purposeâ  i believe no person could have passed over it in the state in which it was then  without leaving marks or tracings behindâ  these walls and the continuation of them at the back of my master s house  are whitewashedâ  i looked at them at the same time to see if there was any mark or scraping of any body having gone up there  and there were no signs of any thing of the sortâ  there is no mode by which any person could come from lord russell s yard across that lead flat cross examined bymr  clarkson q  you say the prisoner appeared in a very agitated state  did the two women appear in a very agitated state also  a  they did john baldwin police constable c103   i was on duty in norfolkstreet  on the morning of the 6th of mayâ  i went to lord williamrussell s house a few minutes past seven o clockâ  i saw a female at the door  who let me inâ  rose was with meâ  i was accompanied into the parlourâ  i asked whether there was any man servant  seeing the things lying about the parlourâ  she said   there is the man servant  sitting behind the door â  i saw a man sitting behind the door  with his hands up to his faceâ  he had his face from meâ  i asked why he did not get up and tender us assistanceâ  he did not get up or take his hands from his faceâ  he made me no answerâ  i asked him after that  why in the world he did not get up and render some assistance  but he did not give any answer the second timeâ  i turned round and said to rose   rose  he must know something about this â  the man made no answer to thatâ  i never received any answerâ  he was near enough to hear what i saidâ  i remained there  collecting the things off the floor  and putting them togetherâ  i then accompanied rose down into the kitchen  to see if there was any thing gone from thereâ  i did not go into the front kitchenâ  i went to the back kitchen door  the door leading into the back yard at the very bottom of the houseâ  it was standing openâ  i examined the doorâ  the prisoner was not with meâ  i walked out into the area  and i thought there was no break inâ  i observed there had been marks of violence on the doorâ  i then went into the butler s pantry  and saw a person sitting behind the door with his elbows on his knees  and his hands up to his faceâ  it was apparently the same man at i had seen in the parlourâ  i told him i thought he had made a devilish pretty mess of it  and said   you must know all about it â  he did not make me any answerâ  i never was answered by any oneâ  i theft went and examined the back yardâ  there it a wall on the left hand side as you go out of the door at the back yardâ  on the top of the wall  there is a lead flat in the upper yard  the yard which is on a level with the passage which comes to the street doorâ  i got up out of the back yard into the top yardâ  i got up by putting my foot on the window ledge  and on the door of the water closetâ  rose was with meâ  when i got into the top yard  i first observed the partition wall between nos  14 and 15  on the left hand of the yardâ  it is a white washed wallâ  near the top of it  there is a ledge of slate projecting about two inches or two inches and a half q  were there any marks on the white washed wall  showing that any person had climbed up  a  not the least whatever  nor any dust brushed offâ  the ledge of slate was perfect  not brokenâ  i took the steps and got up to the lead flatâ  i found the steps standing in the yard by the wall of which i have spoken  leaning against the wallâ  they were not in a position for a person to go up them at they stoodâ  rose pulled them outâ  they were not pulled out before  but standing close togetherâ  on getting up the steps i had a good view of the top of the lead flatâ  there was dust on itâ  there were no foot marks or any appearance of a person having passed over it at allâ  nor any finger marks  for i tried it with my own handsâ  from the state of the dust a person could not have passed over it in the course of the night without marking itâ  i could not do it myselfâ  i tried it with my hand to see if it would make a mark  and it didâ  i afterwards got on it and walked on it  and there were the marks of my feet upon itâ  i also examined the high wall at the back of the yardâ  there were no marks whatever on that of any person having got up itâ  there is a low building on the right hand sideâ  i observed no appearance of a person having got out of the yard or got over thereâ  rose examined thatâ  there were no marks whatever cross examined bymr  phillips q  what were you doing at the time you were angry with the prisoner for not giving you assistance  a  looking at the thingsâ  i did not get any information of what was lostâ  i asked the females what was lostâ  i was angry with him for not assisting meâ  the females said they did not know what was lostâ  they did not tell me the things that were found in the passage q  so that they gave you but little assistance  a  they did all they couldâ  they did not tell me any thingâ  i could not have made any mistake when i got up on the leadsâ  i did the best of my endeavours to see whether there were any marks  but i could find noneâ  i would not make a mistake intentionallyâ  i could not make a mistake there  because then was plenty of dustâ  i am not liable to make mistakes intentionallyâ  when i tried with my hands i could see that i could make marks with my finger q  a man doing a thing intentionally is a misrepresentation  not a mistake  but without intending it  have you not made a mistake in the course of this very examination at the house  a  i do not know that i didâ  when i first examined the kitchen door i thought somebody had broken inâ  i found afterwards that there was no break inâ  i thought there was at first  when i saw the door standing openâ  i did not think so after i examined the door q  did not you go down to the kitchen  examine the door  and first think somebody had broken in  a  the door was standing openâ  it might have been a breaking in i thought  till i examined itâ  i examined the door when i pulled it to  and could see there was no breaking in q  did you examine the door and think there was a breaking in at first  a  how could i examine the door when it was openâ  i examined it as soon as i got outsideâ  i did not think there was a break in after i examined the doorâ  i never said i didâ  it was from seeing the door open that i thought there was a break inâ  i laid my hand on the lead to see if i could make marks with my fingersâ  the dust was not very deepâ  it had been a fine night the night beforeâ  there had been no rain for some time q  tolerable good winds in the beginning of may i believe  were there not  a  certainly there were windsâ  i should not say the wall is thirtyfive feet highâ  i never measured itâ  i do not know how high the whitewashed wall is from the groundâ  i was there a very few minutes q  perhaps you did not make much observation  a  i did all i couldâ  it might be fifteen or sixteen feet highâ  i cannot say that it is double that heightâ  it did not appear so  in my opinionâ  i cannot say how many minutes i was thereâ  it was more than four or five minutesâ  perhaps a quarter of an hour or twenty minutesâ  i call that a few minutes q  have you heard of any reward being offered in this case  a  no  neverâ  i have been a policeman several yearsâ  i joined it the first day q  now on the oath you have taken  do not you know that a placard with a reward was sent to every station house in london  a  i never saw itâ  i never heard it to this dayâ  i do not know what it is to this dayâ  i never heard what the reward wasâ  i never heard of it  or of any rewardâ  i have been in lord william russell s house three or four timesâ  i have not talked to my brother policeman about this dreadful transactionâ  i have seen him several times  but had nothing to say to himâ  i have not talked to different policemen about the murderâ  it has been mentionedâ  i have not heard my brother policemen conversing about itâ  not with any parties belonging to the house q  i am not asking about parties belonging to the house  but about your own brother policemen  do you mean to tell the jury that you have not over and over again conversed with policemen about the murder  a  i have certainly spoken to one or two  but never conversed with any body  not with the parties belonging to the houseâ  i have spoken to people i know q  to policemen  a  of course i haveâ  i cannot say to how many i have spoken to on the subject of the murderâ  i will not swear i have not spoken to twentyâ  i will not swear i have spoken to twentyâ  i might have spoken to twenty  thirty  forty  or a hundred q  why  then  did you fix upon one or two  a  i fix upon nothingâ  i spoke to nobody in no particular manner about itâ  i asked nobody noquestionâ  no policeman belonging to the house q  do you mean to persist in saying you never heard of a reward being offered  a  i doâ  i never was told of any rewardâ  i can write my nameâ  i cannot read much  i am not a very good scholarâ  i can read print in very large letters on placardsâ  i belong to vine street station house  piccadillyâ  that is the station i have belonged to since the 5th of mayâ  i am there every dayâ  i cannot say how many policemen frequent that stationhouseâ  about 184â  it is about three quarters of a mile from lord william russell s house q  now  184 policemen frequenting the same station house with you  do you still mean  on your oath  to tell the jury that you never heard of a reward being offered  a  i never was told of itâ  i never heard of the rewardâ  i do not know what the reward isâ  i never heard of any rewardâ  i never was offered any thing  nor ever heard of any rewardâ  i did not suppose you asked whether any reward was offered to meâ  i say i know nothing about any rewardâ  i was never employed in searching for the missing spoons or forksâ  i never read of 50l  reward being offered for them myselfâ  i am a very bad scholarâ  there was something read out in orders about it  in the general orders q  what was read out about it in general orders  a  there was some reward  but i do not recollect itâ  i cannot tell what the reward was forâ  i do not recollect the sum of money that was mentionedâ  it is a thing i do not take notice of  sums of moneyâ  i was present when it was read outâ  i do not know what sum of money was namedâ  i cannot tell how long it is since it was read out to meâ  it cannot be so long as two months agoâ  i cannot tell whether it was one month ago  or a week agoâ  i cannot tell whether it was four days ago  or two days agoâ  it might be one day ago for any thing i knowâ  i cannot tell whether it was yesterdayâ  i cannot tell you any thing at all about it mr  chambers q  how long after the 6th of may were you first called on to give your evidence  a  i cannot sayâ  something more than a week  adjourned  friday  june19th the queen against francois benjamin courvoisier  continued  john tedman i am an inspector of the c division of police  on themorning of the 6th of may i was called to the house of the late lord william russell  about half past seven o clockâ  i believe i found the coachman or groom at the door  and one or two other persons let me inâ  they were servants in the neighbourhood  but i have not seen them sinceâ  my attention was directed to the door of the area  leading into the passageâ  there is only one door at the bottom of the house  leading into the back area  i mean the door on the floor even with the kitchen and the butler s pantry  the back doorâ  it was open when i examined itâ  i saw it was bruisedâ  i saw several bruises when i closed the door after meâ  they appeared to have been made by a blunt instrumentâ  the door was bruised from the top to the bottom  all the way down in different partsâ  i also examined the doorpostâ  that was bruised also in a similar mannerâ  the bruises on the door and door post did not exactly tallyâ  the door was bruised in one part  and the post in anotherâ  i could not tell exactly whether those bruises had been made by force from the inside or outsideâ  the top part  i thought at the time  had been done from the outside  and the bottom part i thought had been done inside  by the bolt at the bottomâ  that bolt could not be fastened without a good deal of forcing  because it was in a very rusty state  as if it had not been fastened for a considerable timeâ  i exerted myself to see if i could fasten it or notâ  if it had been fastened the night before  i should think it could not have been in the state i found itâ  some of the marks of violence were near that boltâ  those marks appeared to have been made from the inside  and i had not the slightest doubt about the upper partâ  when i had done examining the door  i saw the housemaid and cook close byâ  in consequence of what they said to me  i went as far as the pantryâ  that is on the same floor as the door  close byâ  when i went into that pantry i saw the prisoner sitting on a chair behind the pantry door  between that and the cupboardâ  sarah manser said in his presence   oh dear  my lord is murdered   â  i said   come along with me  and show me where the body of his lordship is â  i said so to mantel and to the prisonerâ  i told both to comeâ  i then went up to his lordship s bed room with both of them  and the cook followed close afterâ  i believe i went first nearly to the door  and when i asked which room it was  i really cannot say which opened the doorâ  i asked for the door  and one of the three opened it  and we made one entryâ  on entering the room i found the curtains of the bed partly drawnâ  two of the shutters were open  of the far and middle windowsâ  the shutter in front  where his lordship laid his face  was nearly closedâ  that was the shutter of the third window  nearest to the head of the bedâ  that was nearly closedâ  i opened that window shutter  and then turned to the bedâ  i saw the bed was covered over  the bed clothes lying as if the body was covered over  and a napkin over the faceâ  i pulled the napkin off  turned the clothes down  and saw a great quantity of blood in the bed  from his lordship s head down to the middleâ  the blood was in the bed  and on one pillow  there was some blood  but not muchâ  i took the napkin off his lordship s faceâ  he looked as if he was asleepâ  his eyes were closed  and the tongue protruded a little way outâ  just as i was doing this  the prisoner was standing at the foot of the bed  and fell back in a chair  and said   oh dear  this is a shocking job    or  a shocking thing     i am not certain which      i shall lose my place and character â  i sent for a surgeon  who came and examined the bodyâ  there was a watch stand standing on a night table  close to the head ofthe bed  between that and the windowâ  there was no watch in itâ  i also saw a russia leather little box  and a mahogany box  which i have here  and two note casesâ   producing them â  here is the watch stand  the russia box  the mahogany box  and the note casesâ  the note cases were lying side by side on the night tableâ  the russia case was opened  and the silk note case also as they are nowâ  there was nothing in themâ  upon finding these things  i asked the prisoner if there was any thing missing  pointing first to the watch standâ  he said   yes    the watch was goneâ  i asked him if his lordship had any money  much money about himâ  he took hold of this note case  examined it  and said   yes  there was a â  10 and a â  5 note in that yesterday in the box â  that is the brown note case with the blue borderâ  i asked him if there was any thing else missingâ  he said he did not know  he did not think there wasâ  i proceeded to make further searchâ  there was a book on the floor by the side of the bed  with a pair of spectacles in itâ  it was on the same side  between the bed and the windowâ  it laid open with the spectacles in itâ  i asked the prisoner   how did this book come here   â  he said   i left his lordship reading that when he went to bed last night â  i searched this russia  box  and found in it a gold ring  a spectacle case  and two coins  one is copper  i do not know what the other is  and this old note case  which is a third oneâ  that is all i found in that box  except two or three bits of paperâ  this mahogany rosewood box contained two tooth picks and two medallionsâ  i then went to the table between the two windowsâ  between the window in front of his lordship s bed  and the middle windowâ  i found a silver candlestick upon itâ  i have called it a table  but it is a book shelf  not a tableâ  it had a top to it  and the books were belowâ  the candle was burnt out with a little snuff in the bottomâ  i have it hereâ   producing it â  that was standing on the book shelf  five or six feet from the head of his lordship s bedâ  a person lying on the bed could see to read by the candle  because it was right in front of the face court q  could a person who was lying in bed reach that candle  a  noâ  no person could reach it from out of the bed mr  adolphus q  i believe after this  the surgeon came and examined the body  a  yesâ  i found no instrument by which the wounds could have been inflictedâ  there was no such thing near the place  i mean not near the bedâ  there was in the roomâ  it was not within reach of any body in the bedâ  on the book shelf  near the candle  i found this russia case with four ivory rouleausfor sovereigns in itâ  i have not examined to see how many sovereigns they would holdâ  i asked the prisoner if there was any thing missing from there  pointing to the book shelf altogether  he said   really i cannot tell you  but ellis knows   ellis was the late valet  to lord russellâ  he is now with lord mansfield  the little russia box was standing openâ  the tray was separate from the boxâ  the prisoner told me it belonged to the boxâ  on the next table  between the other two windows  i found a pair of boot hooks  and a gold pinâ  i looked at it  and the prisoner picked it up  and said his lordship wore that yesterdayâ  i found a quantity of silver articles on the table where the looking glass stoodâ  in the corner of the room near the last windowâ  the looking glass was on the table  a shaving box  and these silver articles all about the table  as a gentleman s dressing articles would beâ  there is a crest on them all  i believeâ  there was an eye glass  two razors  and some other thingsâ  there was no blood  or the slightest mark on either of those razors to denote that they had committed the actâ  there were four other razorsâ  i say the same of themâ  there were halfa dozen walking canes in the room  four of which have gold about themâ  on finding these things i said to the prisoner   it is a very curious thief to leave all this valuable property behind â  he said   it certainly is very strange â  i did not ask him any thing after thatâ  i then went to the next table  upon which was a dressing case  which had been wrenched openâ  i am now speaking of a little table at the foot of the bed  near the fire placeâ  this is the dressing caseâ   producing it â  it was standing in this way  with the back of it towards the bedâ  the lid was on it  a little way out of its placeâ  it had been wrenched at the hinges  and i consider that was done after it had been unlockedâ  it was still lockedâ  the lock remained upâ  i consider that it was unlocked before it was wrenched  and the hinges afterwards wrenched  forced back  without any instrumentâ  it appeared to me that the box being locked had been opened with a key  the top thrown back  and the hinges broken  and then locked again afterwardsâ  a bunch of keys were found in the back drawing room  one of which fits the boxâ  mr  weymouth  i believe  has them court q  you say you suppose the dressing case had first been unlocked  and then the hinges wrenched backâ  can you give any reason what you form your judgment on  a  because i consider if they broke the front part they would not have wanted to break the backâ  they are inside hingesâ  there is no mark at the back of their having been praised mr  adolphus q  could it be opened from the back without some mark being left  a  i think it must have left some mark  but i am only giving my opinion of itâ  after the prisoner and i had examined that box i said   is there any thing missing from here   â  there were five gold rings in that dressing case  and four glass bottles with silver topsâ  we were counting themâ  he was looking at it with meâ  when i asked if there was any thing missing from there  he said   yes  five gold rings  which his lordship wore yesterday â  they were missingâ  here are four mourning and one gold chased ringâ  when he spoke of the five rings his lordship wore yesterday  he meant five other ringsâ  he had looked into the dressing case when he gave me that answerâ  i asked him if there was any thing else missing from thereâ  he said   i can t tell you  but ellis can â  from there i went to a cupboard  in the left hand corner as you enter the roomâ  i there found four silver mounted tobacco pipes and an opera glassâ  i then examined the wardrobeâ  i asked the prisoner if there was any thing missing from thereâ  he said   i don t think there is â  the locks of those places were perfect and uninjured  and the hinges not touchedâ  i found a rushlight stand with a rushlight in itâ  about a third of it was burntâ  the prisoner told me  when i looked at it  that his lordship always had a rushlight burning at nightâ  i asked him what time his lordship went to bed last nightâ  he said   about half past twelve  or a quarter to one o clock â  there was a key in the bed room door  insideâ  i asked the prisoner if his lordship locked the door of a nightâ  he said   no  he never did â  i do not believe i made any observation on the doorâ  the door opens and shuts very gentlyâ  i do not think a person lying in bed could hear it if they were awake  when the carpet is down  it is impossibleâ  i went from there to the front drawing roomâ  there was nothing there worth noticingâ  i then went to the back drawing room  which is a room in which there are booksâ  i found the davenport writing desk turned round a little  moved a little out of its place  and some papers lying on the groundâ  the papers inside were in confusion  and appeared disturbedâ  i saw a screw driver on the chair which his lordship used to sit in to writeâ  i believe mr  pearse has itâ  there was a bunch of keys lying by the side of the davenport writing deskâ  i asked the prisoner if the screwdriver belonged to the houseâ  he said   i believe it does â  i asked him   did his lordship use it yesterday â  he said   i am sure i can t tell you    i then went into the front parlour  or dining roomâ  i found some drawers in the side board pulled out  and plate and plated articles lying about on the floorâ  i said to the prisoner    is there any thing missing from here   â  he said   some spoons and forks  but i cannot tell you how many at present    i do not think there were any leftâ  i found a cloak  an opera glass  and a great many things in the passageâ  i asked the prisoner if they were his lordship s propertyâ  he said   yes â  i said   no thief would ever leave this property behind â  he said   it is certainly very odd â  i asked him if he had locked the street door at night when he went to bedâ  he said   yes â  he showed me howâ  he put up the chain  and locked it  and put the two bolts toâ  he showed me just as he had left it the night previousâ  the upper and bottom bolts boltedâ  i asked how he found it that morning  and after he had unchained  unlocked  and unbolted it  and put the spring of the lock back on the hook  he said   as you see it now â  the area door of the front kitchen was undamaged  nothing arises from thatâ  there is a door at the end of the street door passage which goes into the yardâ  half of that door is glassâ  that door was not disturbed or moved in any wayâ  the chain was on it  and it was boltedâ  it had never been disturbed at allâ  there is an inside shutter to thatâœ  door  but it was downâ  it could be taken down without undoing the fastening of the doorâ  it is an inside shutter  it slips downâ  it shuts up the glass partâ  when i saw it  the shutter was not placed against the glassâ  it was the same as it is kept in the day timeâ  the glass was unbrokenâ  there was not a mark on that doorâ  the area gate was entireâ  nothing had happened to that  it was lockedâ  that is the area that leads into the streetâ  there is no gate to the back areaâ  i afterwards went into the pantry and saw a press there  in which were some drawersâ  those drawers were openâ  the top one was forced  as if it had been done by a chisel or screw driverâ  the lock was sprung  as if it was left locked  and forced open in that stateâ  the articles in the drawers were disturbedâ  there is a window in the pantryâ  i asked the prisoner whether the window had been fastened that night  whether the window shutters had been put to  and whether it was fastenedâ  he said   i do not think it was  i can t say exactly  i am not certain â  i then went to the back door on the basement story  that was found bruised  as i have stated  very muchâ  the prisoner assisted me to examine that door  and pointed out some marks which i had not seen before q  did you say any thing to him on the examination of that door  a  yes  i said   some of you in the house have done this deed â  he said   if they have i hope they will be found out â  i said   there is not much fear but what they will â  i looked about to see how any body could have broken into the houseâ  i examined this wall  pointing out on the model the wall between nos  14 and15  but could not see any mark of any one having come down that wayâ  there were some slates near the top of the steps  which i should think must have been disturbed by anybody descending that wall  but i could not say exactlyâ  i saw baldwin going up the steps to examine itâ  i should think no one could have gotdown that wall without disturbing the slatesâ  there was a quantity of dust on the slates  and that was not disturbed at allâ  i went up on the leads  but baldwin and rose were up there before meâ  there was a great deal of dust on it q  could any person or thing have trampled on that dust without making marks  a  i think it impossibleâ  i think a man passing there must have left marks of his feet behindâ  the weather just before had been dry and windyâ  if a person got over the opposite wall  that is sir howard elphinston s houseâ  i should think they could not have got into lord russell s house that wayâ  i examined that carefully and could see no markâ  the other constables had not been thereâ  there is a water closetâ  they could not have got to the house without getting on that water closet  and i should think they could not have got on the water closet without disturbing itâ  it was not disturbed at allâ  there is a deep area on the other side of that wall  much deeper i believe than on this sideâ  i examined it  i did not measure it q  did you go with the prisoner into his own bed room  a  yes  he showed it meâ  he took me up stairsâ  i there found a purse containing a 5l  bank of england note  and six sovereignsâ  i gave them upâ  i asked the prisoner how he got that noteâ  he said  he gave his lordship change for it a day or two ago  and the rest of the money was his own  he had had it some timeâ  he showed me his box which contained his linenâ  i examined every thing in it as i went along  but saw nothing to tend to explain this case at allâ  he had the key of the box himselfâ  it was left in the roomâ  i left it with himâ  he left the box open every day q  what had he on at the time  a  in the morning a sort of round morning jacket  and a clean shirt  apparently a very clean oneâ  the prisoner was from that time  though not in custody  yet under the watch of the police  and the female servants alsoâ  care was taken to prevent their having any conference with one anotherâ  the prisoner was not debarred or hindered from going to his own room if he pleasedâ  he was taken into custody on friday  the 8th of may  in the afternoon partâ  he was not taken out of the house till sunday night  but there was a constable with him constantly in the room  from friday till sundayâ  he was not exactly in my custody  but there was a constable with himâ  he was taken to the stationhouse on sunday night  the 10th  and before the justices  at bowstreet  on the mondayâ  there were several examinations  and he was finally committedâ  on the evening of the 13th  while he was in custody  application was made for some linen for himâ  his uncle came to the door  and said his nephew wanted a clean shirt and stockingsâ  i did not see the prisoner afterwards  so as to let him know what his uncle had said or done court q  what did his uncle ask for  a  he came to the house and said his nephew wanted some clean linenâ  i had had directions to send him whatever he requiredâ  i did not go up with the uncle to the place where the linen was mr  adolphus q  did you go up to the box  a  next morning i went up with sergeant lovettâ  i did not send the linen that evening  as i was going to bow street myself next morningâ  i went up with lovett next morning  took a shirt out  unfolded it  held it up by the collar  and these gloves dropped out of itâ   producing a pair slightly stained with blood â  i first unfolded the shirt on the bed  and shook it and these gloves dropped down into the trunkâ  they are such gloves as servants wear when in attendance on their masters  white cotton glovesâ  i had not seen those gloves when i examined the trunk before q  had you examined with sufficient accuracy to tell whether they were there  a  i pulled the things out  and laid them on the bed  but i certainly did not examine so accurately as i did thenâ  i had unfolded them  but not shaken themâ  the gloves dropped down when i shook itâ  i did not perceive them when i unfolded itâ  i unfolded the shirt  and did not find them before  and i unfolded it then and did not find them court q  describe how you unfolded the shirt this time  a  i undid itâ  i unfolded it  as if it was lying on a table or a bed  and then held it up and shook itâ  i did not find the gloves when i unfolded it  but when i shook it i didâ  when i first searched we unfolded the shirts on tbe bedâ  i and beresford merely unfolded them mr  adolphus q  did you make any further observation at that time on the linen  a  no cross examined  bymr  phillips q  have you one of the shirts here  a  yesâ  i do not think i have a clean oneâ  the prisoner had all the clean ones  court q  did you examine the prisoner s hands  to see if there were any scratches on them  a  i didâ  i noticed them that day  and also on that day when i took the glovesâ  i first examined his hands on the first day  on the 6th  when i examined his roomâ  i did not see the slightest scratch or mark mr  phillips q  did you consider it your duty to examine the trunks of the different persons in the house when you were first apprised of this melancholy transaction  a  they all wished me to do it  both the prisoner and the other servantsâ  i did do itâ  i examined the prisoner s trunk  to see if there was any weapon or any article with marks of blood on itâ  i satisfied myself on that subjectâ  i searched as carefully as i possibly could q  mind the form in which i put this question  when you talk of the morning of the 6th  is this true  that you  found two shirts  which you looked at  and found them free from spots    a  yesâ  there were several shirtsâ  on the 14th i unfolded the shirt which i was about to give for the prisoner s useâ  i unfolded it in the same way as i did in the first instance as nearly as possible  i thinkâ  on the 6th i took out every article in the trunkâ  i and the prisoner both replaced themâ  i assisted himâ  whatever was done by him was done in my presenceâ  the prisoner had access to this room  and several of our men and the women alsoâ  there was no speck of blood on any thing that i saw in the trunk on the 6thâ  there was no mark on the area door with the glass to it  on the 6thâ  i examined it for the purpose of seeing whether there were any marks q  now  i ask you  not who may have done it  but are there not a number of marks now on that very door which had none on the 6th  a  there are  and also on the post of that doorâ  they appear to have been made with some kind of instrumentâ  the prisoner was under the inspection of the police from the very time of our entering the houseâ  my orders were to keep them separateâ  that is what i meanâ  sergeant pullen was appointed over the prisonerâ  he is with me at the house now  and cronin  a constable  who is hereâ  i did not find any weapon in the prisoner s trunk on the 6th mr  adolphus q  you have been asked about unfolding the linen  did you  eitherâœ  on the 6th  13th  or 14th  when you went for the shirt  do more than lay it down and unfold it  as you would linen you wanted for yourself  a  i have said i shook itâ  i unfolded it and shook itâ  on the 6th i only unfolded it q  in that unfolding might a pair of gloves be in the shirt and you not see them  a  i cannot sayâ  there might beâ  when i held it up by the collar  and shook it  every thing that was in it would come out q  was the extent of your inspection of the prisoner such as to prevent any body from visiting and speaking to him  or only to prevent the women  a  only to prevent the womenâ  nobody could have any conversation with the prisoner but ourselvesâ  it was to prevent any body having conversation with himâ  that was the inspection under which both he and the females were placedâ  i was not present when the marks were made on the glass doorâ  i did not see who made themâ  i know nothing  of my own knowledge  of any being madeâ  i had charge of the premises  that is all court q  did you order any to be made  a  noâ  i only had charge of the premises mr  adolphus q  there were none on the 6th  but there were afterwards  a  yesâ  they are there now william rose police constable d124   i went to lord russell s house on the morning of the 6thâ  i went into the back yard with baldwinâ  we examined the wall between nos  14 and 15â   looking at the model â  this little edging represents some slates which are let into the wallâ  they project about as much as this in proportionâ  that edging of slate was not in the least disturbed or interfered withâ  the wall itself is whitewashedâ  i did not observe the least marks upon that wall  not before i made any myselfâ  i saw the lead flat  which covers a stair case on the other side of the wallâ  i went up for the purpose of examining itâ  i went firstâ  baldwin was with me as far as the leadâ  there was a deal of dust on that lead flatâ  there was no mark on the dust  as if any person or thing had crossed itâ  i tried whether a foot or band placed on it would leave any impressionâ  there was sufficient dust on the lead to write your name in itâ  i also examined this small building on the opposite cornerâ  it is covered with a tilingâ  this black line represents a board in front of the tiling  to throw the water offâ  what is called weather boardâ  neither the tiling or board was at all interfered withâ  that piece of weather board is quite strong enough to bear the weight of a manâ  i examined the premises on the other sideâ  it is a mews  i believeâ  there is a bottle rack in the back yard of the next houseâ  i went over the leads of lord russell s house on to the leads of no  15â  i did not go into the premises on the other side cross examined bymr  chambers q  was it a windy night that night  a  i was not on duty at all that nightâ  i was in the morningâ  it was very cold then henry beresford i am an inspector of police  i received information at the station house about ten minutes past six o clock in the morning of the 6th of may  and went to lord russell s houseâ  after looking at the body i went down stairs to the bottom of the house  to a door which leads to the area at the backâ  i examined that back area door and saw several marks upon it  and also on the door postâ  my impression was atfirst  that the marks had been made with the door open entirelyâ  i looked at the marks on the door postâ  i could scarcely tell with what instrument they had been madeâ  my impression was then that they had been made from the inside  and with the door openâ  upon further inspection and examination that opinion was alteredâ  i think the marks were made by inserting some instrument between the door and the door postâ  the door and door post do not close exactly  and some instrument had been insertedâ  i think the marks were made by a person standing outside the doorâ  they might have been made when the door was bolted and fastened  but i think the door was merely on the latchâ  i think the instrument could not be inserted sufficiently if the door was boltedâ  that is merely my opinionâ  the marks did not appear to have been made with n chisel  but i should say with a hammerâ  i tried that experiment with a hammer upon the halfglass door up stairs leading into the yard  and pearse also triedâ  when i first went to the house there were no marks on that door  but pearse afterwards took me to show me the experiment he had madeâ  the marks on the door and door post of the back area door were not on the same levelâ  the marks on the door were something lowerâ   part of the door and door post were here brought into court â  when i got there the socket of the top bolt was lying on the groundâ  i examined it  and could see some instrument had been put into the socketâ  it was a dark instrument  at it had left a black markâ  it was such a mark as might be left by a pokerâ  that mark could not have been made when the bolt was shot or fastenedâ  the socket was inside the doorâ  i looked at the lower boltâ  the socket of that bolt was not injuredâ  it appeared as if it was slightly sprung  but on more particular examination i do not think it wasâ  it was merely from rust and decayâ  it is much decayedâ  the bolt would not act in itâ  i attempted to bolt it  and it was with the greatest effort i could mote the bolt at allâ  this is the first rail of the door and the door postâ  this is the outside of the door next the yardâ  these are the marks i allude toâ  one is below the otherâ  if an instrument had been put in  which it must be to get a purchase  it would be quite impossible to do that without injuring this edge of the door  as the point of the instrument must necessarily fall on the edge of the door  and there is no injury whatever on the edge of the doorâ  there is a mark made  but that is not the means by which the door could be prised open from withoutâ  there are a great many marks in the place whore the bolt never met the socketâ  the door shuts in a rabbetâ  here is no mark on the edge even opposite all this violenceâ   the witness pointed out to the jury the various marts on the door and door post  to which his evidence refers â  there are marks of violence on the door post by the lower boltâ  i believe these marks to have been made with a screw driver or chiselâ  i am speaking of the marks outside on the door post opposite the doorboltâ  there are no marks on the door opposite to this to correspond with them  scarcely any violence at allâ  there is one impression  but nothing to correspond with the violence on the door postâ  to make the violence on the door post the instrument must catch hereâ  the next mark is what i have described  as i suppose being done with a hammerâ  that mark is about six inches below the handle of the latch outside  and is both on the door and on the door post  one slightly below the other  that on the door being the lowestâ  i should say both those marks were done from the outsideâ  i am quite certain they were made at the same time  and when the door was closed  from the experiment itried on the other doorâ  they were certainly not made with sufficient violence to prise open the doorâ  i am quite satisfied of thatâ  not if the top bolt was boltedâ  if the latch only were latched  it would be sufficient to resist the violence made  even if unboltedâ  between that and the top there are five marks of exactly a similar nature  with more or less violenceâ  why i feel certain the latch would resist it  is because i tried the upper door with only the latch  and i could make quite as much violence on that door with the latch only resisting  without any boltâ  nearly opposite the top bolt outside there are two marks which i have describedâ  i should say all the marks  except those at the bottom bolt  were made with the same instrumentâ  i have no doubt of itâ  there is certainly not sufficient violence to the top bolt to have forced the socket off from the outside  if it was boltedâ  supposing the door to have been prised open from the outside  the bolt could not have forced the socket off in the way in which it appears to have been forced offâ  there are marks inside the socket which it is impossible the bolt could have madeâ  it could not have been forced from the outside without making considerable violence on the doorâ  the mark is partly destroyed  because the plastered wall comes up to the door  and in taking the door away the impression was partly destroyedâ  it could not be avoided  but still here is the mark of the impressionâ  when i first saw it the dust had come down upon it  and it was evident that the socket had been taken off from the inside  with the door open  because i shot the bolt and found it would not make the marks here made  because it would not touch themâ  it would not reach this mark within half an inchâ  i felt quite certain it could not have been made by the bolt itselfâ  the mark of the instrument appeared to have been recently made  because on the end of the instrument reaching the mortar  it had made an indent there  and the dust was thereâ  it had been made within twenty four hours  i should sayâ  i believe there are no other marks inside the door postâ  here is the socketâ  i found the door would not shut within a certain distance  and this piece of wood was put on to show the exact distance the door would be open in its natural stateâ  it was nailed on to prevent it going further than it would beforeâ  it is in the state it was beforeâ  the bolt will not reach this black mark here  nor will it touch any of the marks that appear here jury q  the wood of the door post is not at all rotten  is it  a  not that i can perceiveâ  the nails are all bright now  but they were rusty mr  chambers q  were you in lord william s bed room when you went to the house with the prisoner  a  yesâ  i went up with the prisoner and tedman almost immediatelyâ  i wished to see the bodyâ  i almost immediately asked the prisoner all the articles that were missing  that i might circulate them through the police generallyâ  i asked him to describe them as nearly as he couldâ  among other things he described a gold watch  but not at that timeâ  he kept saying   you had better send for ellis  ellis knows better than i do â  he mentioned several articles only slightly  and said ellis would know much better than himâ  i went down and examined the door  and afterwards went up and had all the articles described as well as he could tell meâ  i went down and examined the door  and afterwards returned up stairs with him againâ  it was then he gave me a description of the articles  after my return to the bed roomâ  he mentioned a gold watch  and showed me where it always stood  in a case alongside his lordship s bedâ  he said it was a gold watch with three sealsattached by a black ribbonâ  he told me the watch was made by a foreign or french maker  but he could not tell me the name  but it had  lord william russell  engraved on the caseâ  that is all the description he gave me about the watchâ  he said one of the seals had lord william russell s coat of arms on itâ  he said he knew it was something about a goat  but all at once he said he would go and get me the impression of his sealâ  he went and got a wax impressionâ  in the course of the day i went up into the prisoner s bed room with tedman and the prisonerâ  i believe mr  mayne was there tooâ  that was the first time his box was searchedâ  it was about the middle of the day on wednesdayâ  in a black trunk or box between two waistcoats  about the centre of the box  i found a chiselâ  this is itâ   produced â  when i first went into lord william russell s bed room  i had seen a rushlight shade  with a rushlight partly burnedâ  i afterwards received a rushlight from one of the servants  i believe sarah manserâ  i lighted it and tried the experiment how long it would take to burn down as far as the one i found in the roomâ  it took about half an hour as near as possible cross examined bymr  philips q  did you find the door of the prisoner s chamber open  a  when i went up to search his box  i really will not undertake to say whether it was or notâ  it was not locked  certainly  at all events  i should sayâ  i really do not recollect whether it was openâ  i do not know that there is no lock to the doorâ  i never took that noticeâ  i really do not recollect whether there is a lock to the door or notâ  i was not in the house when you and mr  clarkson went up to that roomâ  i do mean to say that i do not recollect whether there is a lock  i believe there is  but there may not beâ  if i have any belief  it is in favour that there is a lock  but there may not beâ  the trunk was not openâ  while we were searching the bed i ordered the prisoner himself to get the trunk open for my searchâ  i suppose he opened it  but we were taking the clothes off the bed very carefully one by one  and i really cannot tell i did not notice whether the trunk was locked or notâ  the same search was made of the two female servants as of himâ  i cannot tell whether the trunk was locked or notâ  i should say i took about half of the things out before i came to the chiselâ  i certainly took the things that were at the top of the trunk  off q  did you go to examine it  or had you any specific object  a  on finding the marks on the door  my impression was that they were not made by a house breaker  and that no house breaker had got in  and my wish was to examine all the trunks to find if there was any thing suspiciousâ  i went to the trunk for the purpose of examining its contentsâ  i took them outâ  i did not undo every articleâ  i do not think i took all the articles quite out  for when i got just to the bottom i believe i turned them from one end of the box to the otherâ  i examined sufficiently to convince myself that there was nothing suspicious to be found mr  chambers q  was there more than one trunk or box examined there  a  there wasâ  i examined a black trunk  or i should better have described it as a portmanteauâ  the prisoner saw me take the chisel outâ  he did not make any observation q  did you open any of the articles  a  i think i recollect two shirtsâ  i opened them merely to look at the wristbandsâ  i did not shake them nor turn them out nicholas pearse i am an inspector of the a division of police  i first went to the house of lord william russell on wednesday  the 6thof mayâ  after being up stairs i went to the lower part of the premisesâ  i examined carefully the marks on the door and door post of the door leading out into the back areaâ  it was not my opinion that it was done for the purpose of breaking inâ  i arrived at that conclusion after my examinationâ  the socket which receives the bottom bolt was onâ  the upper one was forced offâ  that appeared to me to have been done by some instrument put into the socket when the door was open  and the instrument wrenched both ways to prise it offâ  i think that was the case  by the marks on the wood of the door postâ  it was on thursday i more particularly examined it q  explain what marks satisfied you that it was forced off by an instrument put into it  a  the top nail was in the socket  and the other nail was at the bottom of the door outside  and the nail bentâ  when the door is bolted  the bolt does not come to the wood by half an inchâ  then is a mark on the wood  and the wood is driven back by some instrument  and it appears very recently doneâ  i found marks at such a distance that the bolt  when shot into the socket  could not reach themâ  i have no doubt those marks were made at the time the socket was forced offâ  i found this poker  produced  in the fire place in the pantryâ  it is bentâ  it was in the same state when i found it as it now appearsâ  such an instrument would make similar marks to those of which i have been speaking  on the woodâ  i found a screw driver on a shelf in the same pantryâ  i applied that to some marks on the door  and it corresponded with themâ  i found this hammer  produced  in a cupboard in the pantryâ  i fitted this to some marks on the door and door post  and it corresponded with them  by placing the claws of the hammer between the door and door post when shut  on the outsideâ  supposing the door to have been bolted inside  the pressure caused by the claws of the hammer would not have been sufficient to force it openâ  it would not be possible with such an instrument to force that door inwardly  supposing it to be bolted insideâ  the marks by the upper bolt and socket could not possibly have been made by a person on the outside  supposing the door to have been fastenedâ  i found the bottom socket started from its place  but not offâ  the bolt was rusted in the socketâ  i should say it had certainly not been used latelyâ  there were marks of violence by that lower boltâ  that violence would not be necessary  supposing the bolt had not been shotâ  i found some marks near the bolt  which  in my judgment  could not have been made if the lower bolt had been shotâ   pointing them out â  here is a mark on the rabbet  as if an instrument had been put in from the outside between the door and door postâ  if the bolt had been shot  that could not have been doneâ  there is a mark on the outside which corresponds with the mark i have alluded toâ  that mark apparently done by an instrument such as this screw driverâ  a person outside could not have made the mark inside in the rabbetâ  he could have made the mark on the outside q  from all your observation and examination of the door and post  in your judgment did any person break that from the outside or not  to enter the house  a  not to enterâ  some of the marks were made outside when the door was to  and some of them when the door was openâ  a breaking into the house could not have taken place by means of that door  not by the marks madeâ  i made some experiments on the half glass door  on the ground floorâ  some were made only last saturday  and some beforeâ  till those experiments were made  that door was uninjured  and unmarked inall respectsâ  i made the first mark on it myself with the hammerâ  i made those experiments to see if such an instrument made such a mark as we discovered on this door  and it appeared to do soâ  there is a latch on the half glass doorâ  an experiment was made on that door while it was on the latchâ  it was made with a hammer  by placing the claw of the hammer between the door and post  and pressing the handle downâ  the latch resisted the pressureâ  it made a similar mark to those on the door below  equally deepâ  i found this pair of tongs  which i applied to this part of the door of the safe in the pantry  which had been forced openâ   producing it â  the mark on this appears to have been made with the tongsâ  it is a black round markâ  i also found a chisel in that roomâ  i compared the screwdriver with some marks on the safe  and there were two marks which appeared to have been made with that jury q  was the bolt shot when you tried this to the door  a  yesâ  it was placed back with very little difficulty court q  that is the bolt of the lock of the pantry safe  a  yes mr  bodkin q  on the thursday did you make any inquiry of the prisoner about any missing property  a  yesâ  i asked him if he knew what money or property had been takenâ  he said he had seen a 10l  and a 5l  note in a purse a few days agoâ  i asked him where the plate was kept that was found in the passageâ  he pointed out a cupboard in the sideboard in the dining roomâ  1 do not think he mentioned any other things as having been missedâ  i searched the prisoner s box on fridayâ  shaw  a constable  was present  nobody elseâ  i was not there at any time with tedman when any search was made in his roomâ  there was a portmanteau  a deal box  and five drawers in the roomâ  i turned the things outâ  i did not find any thing that attracted my attentionâ  i saw the shirtsâ  i cannot say that i opened themâ  to the best of my recollection i saw two clean shirtsâ  they were in the portmanteau  to the best of my beliefâ  on the same day  friday  i made a search in the prisoner s pantryâ  at that time work people had been brought into the house to open the drains  and make search of that kindâ  they had taken up the drainsâ  i commenced my search by the side of the fire place  between the fire place and the sinkâ  the sink is near the fire place  under the windowâ   referring to the plan â  this is the sink in a recess under the window  just at the corner of the fire placeâ  i took off a piece of skirting board which runs from the fire place to the corner  meeting this piece which forms the angle on to the sinkâ   producing the two pieces of skirting â  i took this piece down firstâ  this is the piece that faced meâ  when i pulled that down i saw the purse which i now produceâ  it was about two inches in behind this piece of skirting which remainedâ  i perceived that the mortar had been disturbed before i took this piece of skirting awayâ  i found in the purse five gold coinsâ  one was in paperâ  five gold rings  one a wedding ring  and a small bit of sealing waxâ   the coins were here produced â  i then took away this piece of skirting board which ran under the sink  and found this silver waterloo medal  and a little further on this â  10 bank of england note folded upâ  it had nothing round itâ  the place from which i took it was quite dryâ  it was very near the fire placeâ  the prisoner was in the dining room at the time i found these thingsâ  i went up there directly after finding themâ  he was  to the best of my knowledge  sitting down when i went into the room  but i saw him standing upâ  i think constable collier was with himâ  there was a constable in the roomâ  itook the things i had found up with me  took them out of the purse  and laid them openly before him  and laid the note on the table before himâ  i said   i have found these things concealed in your pantry  behind the skirting board â  he said   i know nothing about them  i am innocent  my conscience is clear  i never saw the medal before â  i took him down into the pantry  and pointed out to him the places from whence i had taken the thingsâ  he again said   i am innocentâ  i know nothing about them â  he remained in the pantry for some time  and i proceeded in my search while he was thereâ  a water pipe goes round his pantry  and continues into a scullery adjoining it  into which there is a door from the pantryâ  one of the workmen was removing the pipe which goes round into the pantry  between the pantry and the door leading into the vaultâ  collier was on my side  and i heard some one say   there is a ring â  i saw the workman put up his hand behind the pipe  nearly to the bottom part of it  and take the ring from the pipe  and i took it from himâ  it was one of the men employed thereâ  this is the ringâ   producing it â  it is a split ringâ  i continued the searchâ  a pen mender was found in a drawer in the pantryâ  the things i have mentioned were all i found secreted below on the first searchâ  after searching below i went up to the prisoner s bed room  and there searched his personâ  i found about 5s  in silver  a small locket  and a small bunch of keys on himâ  i did not apply any of those keys to any of the drawers or doors in the houseâ  there was a variety of keys of different sortsâ  the name of lord william russell is on one of the rings of the keysâ  he said the locket was his ownâ  i have no reason to believe to the contraryâ  i then again went below into the pantry  but found nothing moreâ  other officers were pursuing the search  assisted by workmenâ  i saw the hearth stone taken up the same afternoon or evening  after the split ring had been discoveredâ  i think the prisoner was not there at the timeâ  i did not myself see any thing found thereâ  the hearthstone was very firmly fixed in the groundâ  i should say it had not been recently removedâ  i did not perceive any chink or opening between theâœ  flooring boards and the hearth stoneâ  i received this tea spoon and saltspoon from sarah manserâ   producing them  cross examined bymr  clarkson q  i think i understood you to say that you made some experiment with the door leading into the backyard  a  yesâ  that is the door which is partly glazedâ  i also made the experiment on the door postâ  it was done at the same timeâ  i am the person that did itâ  i did both at the same timeâ  i did some on saturday last  and there were marks some time beforeâ  i cannot tell the dateâ  it might have been a week q  are there any marks either on the door or posts of the door that were not made by yourself  a  yesâ  i think there is oneâ  that was made in my presence by a man named craker  a carpenter q  now  for the purpose of pointing out to the jury the result of your judgment of the violence you found on the door before you  you have cut away part of the door  and brought here  a  i had formed my opinionâ  it was not from the result of my experiment alone that i came to my conclusion with reference to this door q  did that assist your judgment  a  it confirmed itâ  the comparison of the marks i made on the other door and post confirmed my judgment that a similar instrument would make such a markâ  i did notthink it requisite to bring the other door and post hereâ  i thought what was brought quite sufficient for the jury to form their judgmentâ  i made the experiment to show craker that a hammer would make such a markâ  that was partly the reason why i made the experimentâ  i certainly applied the instrument in the presence of craker  just to see that a hammer would make such a markâ  it was not with the hammer that is produced to day that i made the experiment  but a similar oneâ  not the hammer to which i attribute these marks  but a similar one q  why not use the same  a  being fearful it might get out of its place  so that i could not produce it in the state in which i found it  i was fearful i should alter the state of itâ  i have not the hammer here with which i made the experimentâ  the glass door is not here  and i have not brought the hammerâ  it did not occur to me that i should be asked whether the hammer was the same or notâ  if it had  i should have brought it q  were there any experiments besides the one which you have spoken of  made by any body but yourself  a  i do not knowâ  inspector beresford was thereâ  i did not see anyâ  i saw craker apply a pair of tongs to the glazed doorâ  i have seen it put to  to compare the marks with the tongsâ  i never saw the tongs in the commissioner s handsâ  i saw a man named christie  who  i believe  is a builder or carpenterâ  i do not know that i ever put it into the hands of any person  but several might have seen me do itâ  no one did it that i recollect but myselfâ  i do not know that any one made the experiment with the tongs besides those i have namedâ  beresford might have done itâ  i do not recollect seeing the tongs in his handsâ  collier did not have the tongs in his hands in my presence  not to my knowledgeâ  no  collier had not the tongsâ  i think i can safely say soâ  he did not have the tongs in his hands making the experiment in my presenceâ  he stood by and saw me compare themâ  i have no recollection at all of ever having seen the tongs in his handsâ  there was no other instrument used to try any experiment on that door but the tongs and the hammerâ  i remember some gaping experiments on the door post at the edge  two or three pieces out at the cornerâ  i believe they were made with the hammerâ  i must have made them  because i was the only person that applied the hammerâ  if i saw the door i could tellâ  i made as many as eight or ten  and i have no doubt i made the marks you allude to  because i applied the hammerâ  i have every reason to believe i made those marksâ  i know i made marks  but whether those are the marks you have seen i do not knowâ  there is a mark on the door  and one on the postâ  i will not swear i made all the marks on the door and door postâ  i will swear i made half of them  and more than thatâ  there is one mark of the tongs which craker madeâ  there are about twenty marks i should say on the door and door postâ  no marks were made with this screw driver in my presence or to my knowledgeâ  i never saw any marks on the glass door that had the appearance of having been made with this screw driverâ  i think i last noticed that glass door on mondayâ  i did not receive any orders from my superiors to make the experimentsâ  i did not ask permission of any body to make those experiments before i made themâ  they were all made after the last examination before the justiceâ  they were not made at the suggestion of any body  but at my ownâ  i have not brought that door and post with me q  did you bring the door and post which are here to day by order of your superiors  a  not by the commissioners  i proposed itâ  i had them taken awayâ  the parts of the door cut downâ  that was done by my ordersâ  i had no instructions from any body to do soâ  i think mr  hobler told me to bring them hereâ  i had told mr  hobler that i had applied the hammer to the glass doorâ  i received no directions to bring that door here q  are there marks of violence on any of the wood work you have produced which you assume to have been made by a chisel like this  a  there is a mark on a drawer which i saw the first day which such an instrument would makeâ  i cannot positively say whether there are any marks on any of the wood produced which have been made by such an instrument as thisâ  there are none here which i can speak toâ  i think if violence to any extent had been used on mahogany or any other hard wood with an instrument like this  it would show that violence had been used to it q  then this chisel  in your judgment  is not in such a state as you would expect if it had been used for any violence  it depends entirely on what force is usedâ  i searched the prisoner s boxes on friday  the 8thâ  constable shaw was with meâ  he went up with meâ  i believe i asked him to go up for the purpose of making the searchâ  i consider that i made the search with every degree of minutenessâ  there was a black leather portmanteau and a box besidesâ  those were the two articles in which the prisoner s things wereâ  the trunk was not lockedâ  it was shut downâ  i do not think it was strappedâ  there is a strap to itâ  one of the buckles might have been fastenedâ  i do not recollect whether it was strapped or not  but i think not q  what induced you to go up on the 8th to examine the portmanteau and box  they having been examined by tedman on the 6th  a  i went to examine the dirty linen  and the coat  waistcoat  and trowsers  pockets  and to examine the clothes  for no other reasonâ  when i make a search  and see any thing that may strike my attention  i may say a general search  i might go again  and be more minute than i was the first timeâ  i generally make a search with every degree of minutenessâ  i went to make a minute searchâ  i knew that tedman had already made a search on the 6thâ  it was impossible for me to tell whether he made a minute searchâ  i was not thereâ  i had never heard he had made a minute searchâ  nobody suggested to me to make a second search  i swear thatâ  it came into my own headâ  it was on the 8th  the day i found the propertyâ  it was after i had found the property  i mean the concealed propertyâ  i saw some clean linen thereâ  i looked at it  and examined itâ  i might have opened some  but i do not recollect that i opened every article i foundâ  i do not think i did  i do not believe i didâ  i will not swear it  but it is my opinion that i did notâ  to the best of my belief  there might have been articles that i did not openâ  there was such a variety i could not examine every article that came into my hand q  did you not turn out from the box and portmanteau every individual article that was in them  a  i took them out with my handâ  to the best of my belief i did not unfold the shirtsâ  i do not think i have any recollection of opening the clean shirtsâ  i think there were two clean shirtsâ  i think there was only twoâ  i am not certain that i unfolded themâ  i have no certain knowledge that i did do it  and to the best of my belief i did not unfold themâ  i took them outâ  i took out every thing  and put them on the bed  and left them on the bedâ  i did not put them back againâ  i saw the prisoner put them backâ  i had left the room  came there again  and saw the prisoner placing his things awayâ  i put the shirts on the bed with other things q  now  will you have the kindness to repeat what you say passed between you and the prisoner when you say his answer to you was   i am innocent  i know nothing about themâ  my conscience is clear    a  they are about the exact words q  i want to know what was the act done  or the words said by you  which preceded that observation of his  a  i said   i found this property concealed in your pantry  q  what was the object of your making that observation to him  a  i thought it my duty to acquaint him  because i suspected that he had put them thereâ  i thought as an officer i was in duty bound to do it q  it was not to get a confession from him  a  i never tried itâ  it was not for that purposeâ  it was for no other reason than i thought it my duty  in that stage  to make the prisoner acquainted with what was found  and whereâ  i naturally expected he would make some replyâ  it was impossible for me to tell what reply i expected q  do you really mean to tell the jury  and to pledge your sacred oath to that answer  that in making that display of the things  and telling him that  that you had no object to obtain from him a confession  a  i expected he would make a replyâ  i suspected what he might say might be evidenceâ  it might be for him and it might be against himâ  what i expected it is impossible for me to knowâ  am i bound to answer the question  what i expected court q  you can state what passed in your own mind  a  i naturally expected he would make some remark  and i considered it my duty to make him acquainted with it mr  clarkson q  on your oath  did you hope or expect  when you produced the things  and made that statement  that you would obtain from him a confession  or any thing to that effect  a  i was anxious  decidedly  to do all i could in the case  but as to being anxious that he should make a confession to me  i was not particularly anxious  i felt an anxiety to arrive further into the state of the businessâ  i am sot aware that the question was an improper one q  did you do that entirely of your own suggestion  a  i suggested it firstâ  mr  mayne  the commissioner  was in the roomâ  he it a magistrate  i believeâ  i first suggested the producing of the thingsâ  i thought it my duty at once to make the prisoner acquainted with what had been found in the pantryâ  mr  mayne coincided with meâ  mr  mayne said   take the property up stairs  and let him see it    to the best of my recollectionâ  mr  hobler was present  as well as me and mr  mayne q  now attend to thisâ  did you not state this to the prisonerâ  be careful how you answerâ   i have found these things concealed in your pantry  con you know look me in the face   â  did you make that observation  a  yes  i made that observation with othersâ  those were the words q  on your solemn oath  why did you suppress those words when my friend  mr  bodkin  asked you the question  having  as you say  no hope or expectation of obtaining a confession from the prisoner  a  why i should not mention to the counsel that i found them concealed q  noâ  you say you went to the prisoner  and in the discharge of your duty presented the things to him  and said   i have found this property concealed in your pantry â  why suppress the remaining part of the sentence   can you now look me in the face    a  i had no motive or reason for suppressing it q  will you now swear you did not expect to obtain a confession from him  when you said   can you now look me in the face    a  it was impossible for me to say what he would sayâ  i did not expect a confessionâ  i have told you over and over my motiveâ  i considered it my duty to do itâ  i thought it was no other than a proper question to put to himâ  i used no intimidationâ  i cannot say whether that might intimidate him or notâ  it was very likely to do so if he was a guilty manâ  i do not think the question i put was an intimidationâ  it might be taken in that light by the court  but i did not think soâ  if i had thought so i should not have put the questionâ  there is a reward in this caseâ  i believe it it 400l â  there is also 50l  offered for the recovery of some plate stolen from his lordship s houseâ  i do not belong to the same station as baldwin q  do you expect to get any of the reward  if the prisoner is convicted  a  very likely i mayâ  i do expect it  in the course of my dutyâ  if i should say no  i should say falseâ  i have had nothing at all yet  not a farthing from any body q  how long after the reward was offered did you make the discovery in the skirting board  a  the property was found before i was aware there was a reward offeredâ  i found the property on the friday  and on that evening late  i think twelve o clock  i called at the station house  and found there was a reward offeredâ  that was after all the property was found by meâ  i have not the least notion what share i shall get if there is a convictionâ  i am not aware that i shall get any if there is not a convictionâ  the reward is upon convictionâ  if the prisoner is not convicted there will be no rewardâ  i never thought of a reward at the time i said to the prisoner   can you now look me in the face   â  if there had been any bloodstained articles in the prisoner s box  when i examined it on the 8th  i think i should have seen themâ  i believe i should have seen them  if they had been in the box or the portmanteauâ  i searched the prisoner s person  and found a locket on himâ  that locket was never claimed as being his lordship s  not by meâ  i have no reason to believe it is my lord s locketâ  i have reason to believe it belongs to the prisonerâ  i took it from him  because i thought it my duty to take what property he had from him  particularly such an article as thatâ  i did not know at that time that his lordship had lost a locketâ  i did not see ellis on the subject of this locketâ  i never heard ellis say he thought it was my lord sâ  he said it was notâ  i think i did hear ellis say he thought it was my lord s  whilst in the room  but not at the time i took it from the prisonerâ  i think i saw ellis before i found the locket on the prisonerâ  i saw him in his lordship s houseâ  i was not aware  till after the locket was found in the prisoner s possession  that there was one missingâ  that locket was not produced to lady sarah bailey  to my knowledgeâ  i was not present at the time she saw it john christie i am a carpenter and builder  and life in the new cat  lambeth  on saturday last  the 13th of june  i went to no  14  norfolk street  and examined this part of the door and door postâ  it was shown me by inspector pearseâ  i examined it carefullyâ  i saw some marks on the outside of the door  and also on the door post outsideâ  the marks of violence on the outside  were not  in my judgment  sufficient to have forced the door open if it had been boltedâ  if forced open from the outside  the marks of violence must certainly have been greaterâ  i examined the socket of the upper boltâ  i should say that had been forced off by a pokerâ  by applying my magnifying glass to it  i could tee that by the grain of the woodâ  that socket could not have been forced off by the poker  if the poker had been used from the outside  while the door was closedâ  in my judgment  the poker must have been used after the door was openedâ   looking at the poker produced â  i should say it could have been done by this pokerâ  if it was bolted  they could not get the poker inâ  i am quite sure it could not have been done by the bolt q  supposing the bolt to have been shot into the socket  and the door forced open  could the socket have been forced off by the bolt  in the manner it it  a  no  i do not think it could  because the poker could not be usedâ  the staple was on too fast for the violence used to force it offâ  the marks on the door do not appear sufficientâ  i see no mark inside the door post where the bolt shuts againstâ  there is plenty of roomâ  the bolt does not go at far into the socket as the mark of the poker extendsâ  i also observe tome marks at the bottom of the door where the bottom bolt isâ  i looked at the bottom bolt and socketâ  i should not suppose from the appearance of the bolt that it had been bolted at all  very little  if anyâ  the marks of violence at the bottom of the door near the bolt  were not considerableâ  part had been made by a screw driver  and part by a pokerâ  they had been used from the outside  when the door was closed  only on the latchâ  it could have only been on the latch  because i should say they could not get at it well withoutâ  i should have thought the instrument would have cut the door  if it had been dose extent when on the latchâ   the witness here pointed out to the jury the several marks on the door  and door post â  here is the mark of a screw driverâ  if it bad been used to force it open  it would have marked the edge of the door with itâ  here it where the poker hat been applied to itâ  besides the marks at the top and bottom  where the bolts are  there are three or  four little hammer marks outside the door and postâ  they do not appear to have been done with sufficient violence to force the staple offâ  from the whole appearance of this doot  it is my opinion it was not opened with force from withoutâ  it must have been opened first before that violence was usedâ  all these impressions were done while it was on the latch  and not boiledâ  i have teen this part of the cupboard door before  and hare compared the tongsâ  there is an impression of these tongs cross examined bymr  clarkson q  if those tongs were applied to it two or three times to make examinations  that would be very apt to make a mark  would it not  a  that must have been done on purpose mr  chambers q  you speak of hammer marks  and screw driver marks on the large door  did you compare a hammer and screw driver with those marks  a  i didâ  here is the hammer and screw driverâ   looking at them â  they exactly correspond with the marks i find on the door george collier police constable e88   i went to lord russell s house on the 6th of mayâ  i examined the door and door post leading into the back areaâ  in my opinion from the appearances i observed  the breaking was from withinâ  on the 8th of may  i assisted inspector pearse in a search made in the prisoner s pantryâ  i saw mr  pearse remove a small piece of skirting board leading from the fire place to the corner where the sink is  and take a purse from there  and afterwardt a silver medal  with a ribbon attached to it  and a â  10 bank of england noteâ  mr  pearse thenleft the pantry  and went up stairs to the prisoner with the thingsâ  i followed him up to the parlourâ  the prisoner afterwards came down into the pantryâ  i went on with my search about the placeâ  i saw mr  pearse find a split ringâ  it fell from behind a leaden pipe  which is against the wallâ  the prisoner continued in the pantry some time while we were searching  three or four hours  i should thinkâ  i saw some rings in the possession of pearse  which he took from behind the skirtingâ  i did not hear the prisoner asked any questions about themâ  i heard him say he never saw the medalâ  he said nothing to pearse about the rings  but he did to meâ  he was in company with me in the pantry  and i asked him if those were his lordship s rings which pearse had foundâ  he said they  were  and his lordship had worn them yesterdayâ  i asked him where his lordship had put them when he went to bedâ  he said   on the table  in his bed room â  i asked him if his lordship had a gold split ringâ  he said he had  and he used to keep his seals on itâ  this was not before the split ring had been foundâ  i said to him   it is a most shocking thing â  he said   it is  i am innocent of it  but it would not look so bad against me had not the property been found in my pantry â  i said it looked very suspiciousâ  he said   i shall say nothing  at least  until i hear that the whole truth is told â  he was then taken up stairs and searchedâ  he was then taken into strict custodyâ  next morning i again searched the scullery  adjoining the pantry  along with shaw  the police sergeantâ  i assisted in taking down a platerack  and behind the leaden pipe  which runs close against the wall  and adjoining the plate rack  i found this sealâ   producing it â  i immediately showed it to shaw  and marked itâ  it has a coat of arms on itâ  it was entirely concealed between the pipe and the wallâ  there was just room for it between the pipe and the wallâ  i searched another leaden pipe in the scullery  leading to the pantry  and found this signet ring behind itâ   producing it â  it was behind the same pipe as the seal was found behindâ  the ring was bent with the pressureâ  it was squeezed down behind the pipeâ  the ring part was bent down exactly as it is nowâ  it was close to the pipe  so that it could not be seen without feeling thereâ  i was in the pantry on wednesday  the 13th  when the flooring was taken upâ  i took the carpenter thereâ   i had still continued searching the drains and parts  and found nothing â  it it a wooden floorâ  from under the second board that was removed  which required some force to take up  the plumber pulled a handful of rubbish  among which was this sovereign   producing it    which he gave to me  and i marked itâ  it was close to the door of the pantry into the sculleryâ  on the following morning  thursday  the 14th  i and cronin went into the dining room  and saw tedman  and in consequence of what he informed us  we went up stairs  and in a portmanteau  in the prisoner s bed room  i found these two handkerchiefs  one cotton  and one silk  near the top of the portmanteau  and likewise in the same portmanteau  this shirt frontâ   producing them â  the handkerchiefs are both marked  b c â  there were a great many other articles of wearing apparel in the portmanteauâ  i saw some spots or marks of blood on both the handkerchiefsâ  there are several spotsâ  they are dirty handkerchiefsâ  i was present some days before this when that portmanteau was examinedâ  i attended to the examination that was then made of itâ  i could not swear that i noticed either of these things thenâ  i did not find any shirt any where  that this front would matchâ  the handkerchiefs and front are is preciselyâœ  the same state as when i found them cross examined bymr  philips q  was there any body present at the conversation you had with the prisoner  a  there was not q  did you tell him  in the course of that conversation  that he was sure to be hanged or transported  a  i never made use of such a word q  and the prisoner did not upon that tell you he would speak nothing farther to you whatever  a  he did notâ  i have stated the facts word for word that passed between the prisoner and meâ  i did not say   do you suppose for a moment that a stranger would have come and put these things behind the skirting board â  nothing of the kind  and the prisoner did not say   it is very strange â  cronin was with me when i searched the portmanteau  on the 14thâ  i believe it was shaw that i saw search the portmanteau some time beforeâ  i will not be certain  but i know it was searchedâ  i am not sure it was not shaw and cronin  or shaw and staple  i was busy searching another part of the room  and did not pay much attention to itâ  i assisted in the examinationâ  i could see what was going onâ  that might be three days before the 14thâ  it was some time between saturday and the 14thâ  saturday was the 9thâ  i believe the prisoner was sent to prison on sunday night  the 10thâ  i cannot state whether the search was on sunday  because nothing transpired to bring any thing to my recollectionâ  i helped to search the trunkâ  we were searching it for several things  as a good deal of property was missing thenâ  i knew the trunk had been searched on the 6th q  and you went to look for spoons and forks  on the 9th  a  i went to look for several thingsâ  there was no bloody shirt foundâ  i did not know what might be foundâ  the inspector was as likely to overlook a thing  as meâ  i thought i might find the forks and spoonsâ  it was on the 8th that i knew the box had been searchedâ  i did not know it had been searched on the 6thâ  it was on the friday  the day mr  pearse found the property that he and shaw searched itâ  i never heard of tedman searching it on the 6th  not up to this instantâ  i did hear of inspector pearse and sergeant shaw searching it on the 8th q  and you went on the 9th  hoping to find a bloody shirt  and forks  and spoons  and some of the missing things  a  i do not know about hopeâ  i went to see if i could find any thingâ  i went to search what i could find  or for any marks of any thing bloody  that is what i went to look forâ  i suppose it was searched with that same object  on the 8thâ  i suppose inspector pearse and sergeant shaw would not fill the stations they do  if they were not officers of some reputationâ  i have stated that i found the two handkerchiefs very near the top of the trunkâ  i did not overlook themâ  i found them directlyâ  i took up one handkerchief first  and i and cronin took it to the windowâ  i did not take any thing else to the window before i took the handkerchief  because the rest was linen  and we could seeâ  i did not expect any thing was on itâ  i took it to see if there was any thing on itâ  i could not expect about it  i did not knowâ  i took the other to the window in the same wayâ  i searched the whole of the boxâ  it was not lockedâ  the room door was not lockedâ  i did not notice whether there was a lock on itâ  i had no charge of the trunkâ  there were a great many police in the houseâ  sergeant pullen is in the house nowâ  superintendent baker  and police constable humphries  and one or two of the c divisionâ  i should think there are eight or ten altogetherâ  i will not swear to oneâ  the handkerchiefs were lying very near the top  no one could search the portmanteau without seeing them  if they had any eyesâ  i found the shirt front after i found the handkerchiefsâ  near the middle  a little below  under the handkerchiefsâ  i should consider a torn shirt front was a thing that would attract attentionâ  it attracted my attentionâ  i do not see how any one could miss seeing it  i could not  i knowâ  if a person took each article one by one  out of the trunk  i do not think he could have missed seeing it  or the handkerchiefs either  if they had been thereâ  i do not think the prisoner was in the house when i searched the trunk after the 9thâ  i cannot tell what day it wasâ  i think it was after the sunday  but i could not say what day it wasâ  i do not think it was on sundayâ  i think it was on monday morningâ  i believe it was shaw and humphries who searched it with meâ  they searched more particular than i didâ  i was searching other placesâ  i helped a littleâ  i mean to say i did not search the box minutely myselfâ  i saw them searchingâ  i was searching other places at the same time there  a band box  and other thingsâ  they appeared to me to be minutely searching the boxâ  i observed none of these things on that dayâ  the prisoner was certainly not in the house on the mondayâ  any body might have access to that room  for what i knowâ  my duty was below stairsâ  i found the door openâ  i cannot tell whether every body might have had access on that morning  for i was not thereâ  i have not brought the trunk hereâ  it is a moderate sized travelling portmanteauâ  i found it strappedâ  there was one strap on itâ  it was buckledâ  it was not locked  but there was one strapâ  it was about eleven o clock on the morning of the 14th  that i went to search itâ  i cannot tell whether the other time was on the monday  or notâ  i cannot tell what o clock it wasâ  if i could tell you what o clock it was  i could tell you the exact dayâ  i think it must have been in the afternoonâ  i should say it was in the afternoon  after two o clockâ  it could not have been many days before the 14th  because monday would be the 11thâ  if i knew how many days it was  i could swear to the dayâ  i cannot tell whether it was two days before mr  bodkin q  how many windows are there in the prisoner s sleeping room  a  oneâ  the portmanteauâœ  was standing near to the window  but it was more towards the middle of the room when i saw itâ  opposite the dressing tableâ  when i lifted up the lid of the portmanteau  the lid went against the table  in a line with the windowâ   pointing out the situation on the plan â  the window is at the back of the houseâ  the front of the portmanteau was from me when i went into the roomâ  as you enter the room  the portmanteau was on the left hand side  and the window tooâ  i should not think any person could fail to see those handkerchief when they looked into the portmanteauâ  i took them to the window to examine whether there was any mark on them  because they are darkâ  there was not light enough at the portmanteau to distinguish whether there were any marks on them court q  what is the size of the room  a  a very small room indeed  just big enough to hold a little bedstead  a table  and two or three chairsâ  it is a small back attic frederick shaw police sergeant e8   i went to lord william russell s house on friday  the 8th of may  and assisted in searching the pantry that afternoonâ  on the following day  saturday  i saw collier find a gold seal behind the pipe  and a seal ring bent behind the water pipe in the sculleryâ  the sink had been taken up in the pantry  and taken away  when i got thereâ  about five o clock on the saturday afternoon i searchedthe pantry  near the hearth  and found this gold locket close to the joist of the flooringâ   producing it â  the stone hearth had been taken upâ  i was sifting the dust  and among it turned over the gold locket court q  were the joists of the floor taken up as well as the hearth  a  only the hearthâ  i found this close to the joists cross examined bymr  phillips q  had you ever searched the prisoner s box  or assisted to search it  a  i did on friday afternoon  the 8th  between five and six o clockâ  i assisted inspector pearse to search it  to see if we could find any thing to lead to a discoveryâ  our search was a minute oneâ  we do not make a careless search when our object is to find any thing suspiciousâ  i paid every attention my duty required me to payâ  no one else was in the room  when we searched it on the 8th  but me and pearseâ  we took all the things out of the box one by oneâ  we took each article up in our hands  and placed it on the bedâ  we left nothing behind that we considered suspiciousâ  we took every thing out  and put it on the bed  so as to bee the box was empty and contained nothing moreâ  i am sure nobody was in the room with me  except pearse  at the time we were searching the boxâ  i did not search it again after the 8th  that i am sure ofâ  i never searched or assisted to search it after the prisoner was seat to prisonâ  i never searched it with collier s assistance  nor in company with humphries or croninâ  my only companion at my only search was mr  pearseâ  the portmanteau is a good sized oneâ  it is hereâ   produced â  the initials  f b c  are on itâ  the prisoner s room is a small oneâ  i was near the window when i examined the portmanteauâ  the room was perfectly light enough to see any thing mr  bodkin q  do you remember whether any thing was taken to the window in order to examine it by the strong light of the window  a  i do not recollect that there wasâ  the bed was on the right as you went into the roomâ  the portmanteau was in the centre of the room  near the fire place  when i went up stairsâ  when i took the things out  they were put on the bed away from the windowâ  i do not recollect that i saw any handkerchiefs among the things that were taken out mr  phillips q  you found no breast of a shirt torn  in the search you made  a  i recollect seeing one in the portmanteauâ  i saw one very similar to thisâ   looking at the shirt front produced â  i think it is the sameâ  i recollect seeing a front there of this descriptionâ  i do not know that i saw these two handkerchiefs thereâ  there were a great number of things in the portmanteauâ  i will not speak positively to the handkerchiefsâ  this front i recollect seeing on the 8thâ  mr  pearse was with meâ  i had this front in my handâ  i remember there were a good many neck handkerchiefs in the portmanteauâ  i do not recollect seeing any of this description paul cronin police constable c158   i went to lord william russell s house on wednesday morning  the 6th of may  about half past seven o clock  but i did not go into the house till half past tenâ  i was outside the door till thenâ  i remained there every day and night until saturdayâ  i assisted mr  pearse in searching the pantry  and saw him pull down two boards of the skirting  and take out a gold clasp purseâ  he found it just on the corner inside the skirting boardâ  i also saw him draw out a ribbon  and attached to it was a waterloo medalâ  he took that from behind the second skirtingâ  i next saw him draw out a 10l  noteâ  i believe mr  pearse took possession of all that propertyâ  it was on friday the 8th  that mr  pearse made this search  and found the property  about eleven o clock in the day  or about twelve or one  as near as i can recollectâ  on tuesday  the 12th  i went there again  in the morning  with mr  pearseâ  i had left the house after saturday nightâ  i had done nothing in the house from saturday night till tuesday morningâ  on the 12th i went into the scullery  leading from the pantry  and examined the flooring  particularly under a small vault attached to the sculleryâ  i passed my hand along the boards composing the flooring of the scullery  and in doing so my finger struck against what i considered to be a ringâ  it is a very dark small place attached to the sculleryâ  i drew my hand out in the darkâ  i had no lightâ  i drew it out with some difficulty  and it appeared to me to be part of a watch key with the pipe and ring broken offâ  this is itâ   producing it â  i went again on the following day  wednesdayâ  i first searched in the pantry  and afterwards up in a yardâ  there are two yards  one above the otherâ  it was in the upper yard i searchedâ  i went there with collier for the purpose of raising some stones which appeared looseâ  after raising the stones i saw a leaden sink encased with woodâ   produced â  it came from the pantryâ  i had seen it in the butler s pantryâ  it was a fixture there  just over the place where pearse found the propertyâ  i saw the sink taken down  and  i believe  it was placed in the yard afterwardsâ  i looked at the sink round the edgesâ  it appeared to me that the lead had been turned up and put down againâ  not the whole of it  only a small place in frontâ  i turned up the front with an iron chisel which i had in my hand  looked inside  and saw a watch thereâ  i immediately called collier  who saw me take the watch outâ  i kept it and sealed it up almost immediately afterwardsâ  i produced it at bow street  and have had it ever since in my custodyâ  it was in the same state as it is now  with the glass out of it james ellis i am at present in the service of the earl of mansfield  i was for two years and eight months in the service of the late lord william russellâ  i left i believe on the 1st of april this yearâ  the prisoner succeeded me in my situationâ  i remained two days there to initiate him into his dutiesâ  i am perfectly well acquainted with three out of these five ringsâ  they belonged to lord william russell  and it is my firm belief that the other two belonged to himâ  he was always in the habit of wearing those five rings dailyâ  when his lordship retired to bed  they were usually placed on a small dressing table in the bed room  which stood between the two further windowsâ   looking at the watch â  i used to wind up lord russell s watch for him  on a common average  five days out of the sevenâ  i firmly believe this to be the watch which i was always in the habit of winding upâ  that i placed at night always in a watch stand on a little table by the side of his lordship s bedâ  here is a name inside it  but it appears to me to be the maker s nameâ  i never noticed that his lordship had a watch in which his own name was engravedâ  this name is engraved on the inside case of the watchâ  i am perfectly acquainted with this seal  these two watchkeys  and this signet ringâ   looking at them â  they were all the property of his lordshipâ  this split ring appears to be the same which was always worn to the watchâ  it is rather broken  but it is a similar ring to what his lordship usedâ  the watch key also appears to be the same  but a portion of it it goneâ  his lordship had a chased key of precisely the same patternâ  i know that his lordship had a waterloo medal  but i never examined it  and he had a ribbon attached to itâ  this russia leather box was called the cash boxâ  i know that  and these note cases i can speak positively toâ  hislordship had always foreign gold coins in the cash box  but i never examined themâ  it was always evident to me they were not english moneyâ  i remember to have seen this miniature in lord russell s possessionâ  it was always in the small cash boxâ  i never saw it any where else while i was in the serviceâ  this gold pencil case i know perfectly well by marks which i now see on itâ  that was his lordship sâ  he was in the habit of carrying it in his pocket every dayâ  this tooth pick case appears to me precisely similar to the one always carried by lord william russellâ  they were generally placed on the small table at night  where the rings were placedâ  this sugar sifter i am positive toâ  it was always used by me when in lord russell s service  and this dish cover is the top of a hash dish always used by me in lord william s serviceâ  this cloak appears to be his lordship s evening cloakâ  it appears precisely the same as when i left his lordship s serviceâ  a card is sown in itâ  i have seen a locket in his lordship s possessionâ   looking at the one found in the pantry â  it might have resembled this  but i am not quite positive of itâ  i never by any chance had much cause to examine it  only if his lordship left it in any part of the house  he desired me to fetch itâ  i am not at all positive to the locketâ  it was a similar one court q  you say you have seen his lordship with a locket resembling this  but cannot take on yourself to say this is the identical locket  a  no  i cannot mr  adolphus q  we understand a rushlight was lighted in his lordship s room every evening  a  every night when his lordship retired to bedâ  his lordship was never in the habit of reading in bed at all  to my knowledgeâ  i never observed itâ  the candle  by which his lordship went to bed  was always put out by me when  his lordship retired to bed  and put on the table by the side of the rushlightâ  i never observed the candle to have been left to burn out in the socketâ  his lordship was particularly careful on the subject of fireâ  he has very often cautioned meâ  i remember his lordship s returning from a short visit to richmondâ  i saw the prisoner several times after that  before i left londonâ  probably two or three timesâ  once i recollect very well the prisoner asking me if i had any recollection of his lordship s having a locketâ  i told him i hadâ  he then said his lordship had lost the locket while out of town at richmondâ  i said i wondered how it could be lost  as his lordship always carried it in the note caseâ  the prisoner also said he could not account for its being lost  unless it had fallen from the pocket of his lordship s clothes while he was brushing themâ  he said his lordship had written  or was going to write  to mr ellis  the proprietor of the hotel at richmond  concerning the locketâ  there are only two days in particular that i recollect having conversation with the prisonerâ  one day was shortly after the return from richmond  and the other the monday before the murderâ  i rather think this conversation was a day or two after the return from richmondâ  when i left lord russell s service  i handed over to the prisoner the plate that was in my careâ  i had a list of it  which i gave to the commissioners  i believeâ   the plate box was here produced â  the list is inside thisâ  i examined the contents of the box at the house with my list  before it went to the bankinghouseâ  this is my own listâ  it is the list by which i checked the plate before i delivered it over to the prisonerâ  i examined the contents of the chest with this list shortly after this eventâ  four table spoons  four large forks  four dessert spoons  and two tea spoons were then missingâ  the greater portionof the plate was always kept in my own bed room at the top of the house  in a drawer belonging to a large dressing table  standing in the valet s roomâ  they were generally deposited there  but not alwaysâ  i considered it the safest place for themâ  the plate in ordinary use was kept in a cupboard in the pantry belowâ   several articles of plate were here produced by mr  cumming â  to my firm belief these are the articles that were missing from the house  according to my listâ  they correspond in quantity and size  and they have the crest of lord russell on themâ  the same as i have always seen richard mattison harrison i am chief clerk in the banking house of hoare and co   fleet street  the baroness de clifford keeps an account thereâ  mr  wing  the solicitor  draws on her account occasionallyâ  i remember paying a cheque of mr  wing s on the 25th of april lastâ  i can tell from an entry which i have  that this 10l  note was one of the notes i paid on that occasionâ   this was the note found concealed in the pantry â  the cheque was for 200l  and was drawn by thomas wingâ  here is the chequeâ   producing it â  it is dated the 25th of april  1840 cross examined bymr  clarkson q  have you the book here in which the original entry is  a  yes court q  do you know who you paid it to  a  i cannot say  but this is one of the notes i paid for that cheque thomas wing i am solicitor to the baroness de cliffordâ  i drew a cheque on her bankers  by virtue of her authority  on the 25th of april this yearâ  i received the amount myselfâ  i do not know whether this is one of the notes i received on that occasionâ  i received fifteen 10l  and ten 5l  notesâ  i kept them till i saw the baroness on the monday after  and then gave the notes i received from mr  harrison to her ladyshipâ  i gave the self same notes to her ladyship on the monday morning following the saturday on which i received themâ  the deceased s name was lord william russell  by courtesy lady clifford i am related to the late lord william russellâ  i am the widow of one of his sonsâ  i remember  on the 27th of april  receiving from mr  wing some bank notes amounting to 200l â  among them were some 10l  notesâ  on the 29th of april i gave one of those 10l  notes to the late lord william russellâ  it was given for a charitable purpose  court q  was there any thing to be done with it  a  it was to be given to lady sarah baileyâ  i went abroad on the friday  the day after lady sarah bailey i am related by marriage to the late lord william russellâ  he married my sister  i knew him for many yearsâ  i reside at hampton court palaceâ  while lord russell was residing at richmond this spring he came over to see me many times q  do you remember on any occasion any thing happening about a locket  a  yesâ  he left the locket on my table while he went to chapel in the afternoon  and when he returned from chapel i gave him the locket againâ  he put it into the left hand pocket of his coat  an upper pocket when i first saw it it was in a brown and blue letter case which was worked by his daughter q  had his lordship a great regard for that locket  a  i suppose so  because he wrote for itâ  i bad never seen it before that timeâ   looking at the letter case â  this is the letter case  and to my belief this is the locketâ   looking at it â  there is hair in itâ  i cannot say whose hair it isâ  it is tied with a piece of blue silkâ  lord william russell wrote to me to inquire about the locketâ  i think he wrote for it from camden hillâ  i wrote to him in answer to his noteâ  he was at richmond at the time  but my letter to him was directed to norfolk streetâ  i have no particular reason for knowing who was in attendance on him during his stay at richmondâ  i did not see his servant when he came over to me at hampton court court q  what was the occasion of lord russell s taking the locket out  a  he gave me a letter to read from that very caseâ  i cannot remember whether the locket fell out  but when he was gone i found it on my table john harris i am an upholsterer and work for mr  hughes  i went to lord william russell s house on the afternoon of the 5th of may  to adjust the bell pull in his lordship s bed roomâ  i might be there about half an hourâ  i did nothing but adjust the bell pullâ  it was a small ivory bell pull  and the ring cut the ropeâ  i was there about half an hour  to make it fastâ  i left the house then henry lovick i am a bell hanger  on tuesday  the 5th of may  i went to lord william russell s house about three o clock  or between three and four o clockâ  i did a little job in the bed room  and i did something also to the door of the roomâ  i was there twiceâ  i left about halfpost seven o clock in the evening the last time george doubleday i was groom to the late lord william russell  i did not live in the houseâ  i was in the house on tuesday  the 5 th of may  i cannot recollect at what timeâ  i saw his lordship about eleven o clock in the forenoon at his houseâ  i was there once afterwards  i suppose a little alter six o clockâ  i did not go next morning before twenty minutes before nine o clockâ  i had been sent forâ  i continued there during the day till eleven o clock at night mary hannellre examined  when i came down in the morning i found the half glass door on the ground floor bolted and chainedâ  i do not know whether the shutter was put up to it the night beforeâ  it was not up in the morningâ  it was not always put upâ  the chain goes immediately below the glass part of the windowâ  i do not know whether a person outside could see where that chain was sarah manserre examined  i am not able to state how the glass door was over nightâ  i do not remember any thing about itâ  the shutter was never up when his lordship was at home jury q  were you in the habit of seeing the poker in the butler s pantry  a  yesâ  i never examined itâ  i do not know whether it was bent or notâ  i never had any thing to do with it william winter i was one of the plumbers employed in lord russell s house after his decease  i saw a sovereign found under the boards on wednesday  the 13thâ  i gave it to one of the policemen charles ellis i keep the castle tavern at richmond  lord william russell came to stop at my house  on the 5th of april last  and remained till the 22ndâ  he brought a man servant with himâ  it was the prisonerâ  there was also a groomâ   looking at the witness doubleday â  l would not swear that is the man  but he is very much like himâ  the prisoner was the only person in personal attendance on lord russellâ  on the 25th  after lord russell had left my house  i received this letter from himon the subject of a locketâ  in consequence of that letter i made immediate inquiry  and search was made after the articleâ  nothing was heard of it  nor ever has been sinceâ  i cannot find the envelope of that letter any whereâ  the seal of it was from the travellers  clubâ  i believe the prisoner brushed and cleaned his lordship s clothes while he was there charles ignatius claptenburgher i am a watchmaker in regentstreet  lord william russell s watch was repaired under my directionsâ  this is his lordship s watchâ   looking at it â  i know this watch key  by having taken it off the last time the watch was repairedâ  it is the watchkey belonging to lord william russell s watchâ  but it was taken off  and put on one which was lent to him while his own was repairingâ  i sent it back again to him with the watchâ  it fitted the other watch which i lent him charlotte peolaine my husband s name is louisâ  he is a frenchmanâ  i am an englishwomanâ  we keep the hotel dieppe  leicester place  leicester squareâ  i know the prisonerâ  i think it is about four years ago that i knew himâ  he came to a situation  to take a place in the hotel as waiterâ  i do not recollect whether he told me his nameâ  we used to call him jeanâ  french is generally spoken at our hotelâ  he staid with us a month or five weeks  it was not long q  since that time has he continued to be acquainted with you  coming in occasionally  a  i never saw him since till about six weeks ago i thinkâ  he then came to our hotelâ  it was on a sunday eveningâ  he merely asked me how i wasâ  he staid about two minutes q  how did he introduce himself to you  do you remember  a  he knocked at the room door  i said   come in    and he walked inâ  i did not recognise who he was at the momentâ  it was some time since i had seen himâ  he said   do not you recollect me   â  i said   no  i do not â  he said   i am john  that used to live with you some time  over in the square â  i recollected him thenâ  he staid a few minutes  and then went awayâ  i believe i asked him if he was in a situation  and he said   yes â  i said   i am very glad of it â  he said   with a gentleman â  he did not tell me his nameâ  i saw him again  i think it was on the sunday week afterwards  or the sunday fortnightâ  it was on a sunday eveningâ  he merely came in and asked me how i wasâ  it was in the eveningâ  he had a paper parcel in his handâ  he asked me if i would take care of it till the tuesday following  and he would call for itâ  i said  certainly i would  and he left it with me  and went awayâ  i put the parcel in a closet  and locked it upâ  it is a closet i use generallyâ  i had no notion at that time what the parcel containedâ  it was a sort of round parcel  tied with a string  and sealed q  did he call for it on the tuesday following  a  i never saw him since until to dayâ  i heard once or twice of the murder of lord william russell q  had the parcel been left with you before you heard of the murder  or not  a  oh yesâ  i took the parcel out of the closet yesterday morning  for the first timeâ  i was induced to take it out  on account of what my cousin brought up stairs in a french newspaperâ  he read it to me  and showed it to meâ  in consequence of that i had some conversation with my cousin  and sent for mr  gardie  who lives in king streetâ  he is a chaser and modeller  i believeâ  i also sent for mr  cumming  an attorney  who is an intimate friend of oursâ  mr  vincent  my husband s partner  was also presentâ  he is the person who gave me the information out of the french paperâ  the parcel wasopened in the presence of those personsâ  it had never been opened before  from the moment it came into my possessionâ   mr  cumming here produced the parcel â  this is the parcelâ  this is the brown paper that was over itâ  the parcel contained spoons and forks  silver i suppose  two pairs of new stockings  and two instruments  which i do not know the name of  a pair of dirty socks  a jacket  and something  i do not know what they call it  i think it is tow  round the plateâ  it is like ravelled rope  that would have the effect of preventing the plate being felt  or from jinglingâ  it did not make the least noiseâ  mr  cumming immediately wrote down on a sheet of paper what there was  fastened it up again  and brought it here  i believeâ  before he fastened it up  we signed the inventory  to attest what it contained cross examined bymr  phillips q  about what a clock in the day yesterday was this  a  about four  i thinkâ  we have a billiard table in our hotelâ  it is not much frequentedâ  merely by the gentlemen who board and lodge in the houseâ  there are a few that comeâ  it is not exclusively kept for the guestsâ  any body can go and play that likesâ  any stranger may come in and playâ  there are no other games played in the houseâ  not backgammonâ  it is a peaceful houseâ  the police have not been there at allâ  no one was ever taken out of it  i think i can swear thatâ  i never heard of itâ  there was never any gang of suspected persons taken out of our house by the police  nor any person q  what did you mean by saying you think you could swear it  a  because i am never down in the billiard room myself  but i never beard any noiseâ  i do not think there is any gambling house in leicester place but ours  and ours is not a gambling houseâ  there are not a great many gambling houses in leicester place that i am aware ofâ  we have lived there two years next septemberâ  i never inquired much whether there were gambling houses thereâ  our house is very much frequented by foreignersâ  there are generally a good many thereâ  the prisoner went by the name of jeanin our serviceâ  that was the name i gave himâ  i do not know whether his name was jeanâ  i called him so for convenience sakeâ  because it would be easy for us all in the houseâ  i never knew him by any other nameâ  we do not take in english papers at our houseâ  i very seldom read them  i have not timeâ  a few english gentlemen occasionally come to our houseâ  we never take in any but french newspapers q  have you not had for the last five weeks heard continual conversations about this dreadful event  the murder of lord william russell  a  noâ  i am never among the gentlemen down stairs  who have conversationsâ  i have a husband  but he is in franceâ  he has only been gone a fortnightâ  he is the master of the hotel  that is allâ  i have not heard my husband speak of the murder  to my knowledgeâ  if he has i have forgotten it  but i do not think he has mentioned the subject to meâ  i do not walk in the streets on sundaysâ  i go to church sometimesâ  i have not observed the placards of the sunday newspapersâ  i have never seen posted up in large letters   the murder of lord william russell    nor heard the confessions of the prisoner cried about the streetâ  i think i heard of the murder the day after it was committedâ  i was certainly very much shockedâ  i do not know that i said any thing to my husband about itâ  it might have been named  i cannot recollect whether we did or did not speak of itâ  i have not time to think of these sort of thingsâ  i am always occupiedâ  my husband and i very seldom dine togetherâ  we breakfast together sometimesâ  i do not know whether it was my occupations that preventedmy mentioning it to my husbandâ  i do not recollect whether i said any thing about it to my husbandâ  i did not say any thing about it to his partner to my knowledgeâ  i did not speak of it to any body  being generally occupiedâ  mr  vincent is always occupied down stairs  and sometimes i do not see them the whole of the day  from morning to eveningâ  i sleep with my husband  but sometimes i have gone to bed a long time before himâ  that was not the case during the whole three weeks he was in townâ  i cannot say whether i was frequently awake when he came to bedâ  i cannot say whether i was too much occupied to hold any conversation with my husband during the three weeksâ  that is a question i cannot answer mr  adolphus q  you have been asked about the reputation of your house  is there any pretence on earth  to your knowledge  for calling it a gaming house  a  noâ  the police have never to my knowledge broken in and taken any one outâ  it has never happened while we have lived there q  respecting your conversation with your husband  do you  like other women  converse with your husband on things that pass  and think no more of it after it is over  a  yes q  whether you heard of the murder of lord william russell or not  could you have any idea that jeanwas the same person as francois benjamin courvoisier who was accused of the murder  a  noâ  parcels are sometimes left in our care  at the counter down stairsâ  i put the parcel in question in my closet  and locked it upâ  i never moved it outâ  it was put at the bottomâ  the closet is in the first floorâ  the billiard room has no connexion or communication with thatâ  the billiard room is on the parlour floorâ  whoever comes to play at billiards have no business up stairsâ  there is no backgammon table in our house court q  you have said you heard of this affair the day alter it happened  a  i believe so q  can you tell how long before that it was that the parcel was left with you  a  i think it might have been a week or a fortnightâ  i cannot positively sayâ  i do not recollect what part oâ  the week i first heard of it louis gardie i am a modeller and chaser  and live in king street  soho  i am an acquaintance of mr  peolaine  who keeps the hotel dieppeâ  i was at that hotel when a parcel was brought in by a manâ  it was on a sundayâ  i was only a visitor there  and of course did not pay much attentionâ  i happened to be there by chanceâ  i saw it was a little parcel  and was covered with brown paperâ  i did not know the person before who brought itâ  i cannot positively say the prisoner is the man  because i never knew the man  and be was there so short a time  of course i could not say exactlyâ  i got a glimpse of him  and that is allâ  i paid so little attention i do not know what really passedâ  i know the parcel was left  and the door shut  and the gentleman goneâ  it was left in madame peolaine s chargeâ  i was at the hotel yesterdayâ  mr  vincent  the partner of the house  came and fetched me  with regard to some news he had got from a journal or newspaperâ  i went to the hotelâ  he said something to me  and we went directly to the city to mr  cumming  who went back with us to the hotelâ  when we got back the parcel was producedâ  i cannot say whether it was the parcel i had seen before or not  i paid so little attention to itâ  mr  vincent  madame peolaine  me  and mr  cumming were present when the parcel was producedâ  mr  cumming cut the string  and opened itâ  it contained some silver articles  a jacket  and other thingsâ  a list of the contents was made out in my presence court q  you were present when the parcel was delivered to mrs  peolaine  on a sunday  have you any thing in your mind to tell you what time it was  a  i cannot say exactlyâ  i know it was sundayâ  to the best of my recollection  i think it was about five or six weeks from this timeâ  i heard of the murder of lord william russellâ  it was about that time  i think  a little before  i think richard cumming i am a solicitor  and carry on business at no  17  old jewry  i saw mr  gardie and mr  vincent at my office yesterdayâ  i accompanied them to mr  peolaine sâ  he is not a client of mineâ  i am acquainted with himâ  a brown paper parcel was produced to me by mrs  peolaineâ  it was tied up with string  and the string sealedâ  my advice was asked on the subject of opening itâ  i opened it myself  and made this list of the articles that were in itâ  i then did it up againâ  before doing so  i noticed a crest on the forks and spoonsâ  after doing it up  i proceeded to a bookseller s shop  in order that i might see by roe peerage book the treat of the bedford family  and having satisfied myself that a goat  which was on the spoons  was the crest of that family  i immediately proceeded from ridgeway s  the bookseller s shop  to marlborough street  for the purpose of seeking the advice of a magistrate  and to be relieved from the possession of the parcelâ  i saw an officer  who introduced me to the clerk of the magistrate  and i made a communication to himâ  in consequence of a communication from him  i immediately came here in a cabâ  i arrived here about six o clockâ  i sent in a communication by note to the solicitor for the prosecution  and was directed to come inâ  i then made a communication to mr  wing and mr  hoblerâ  he paper which i brought in some time ago  contained a portion of what the brown paper parcel contained  but i had given up the brown paper  and some other articles  having first put my initials on them  by the direction of mr  hobler  to an officerâ  the spoons  and forks  and plate  which i have brought in  were in that parcelâ  here are my initials on the cover of the parcelâ  there has been an address on the cover  which is nearly erasedâ  besides the spoons and forks  there is a gold ear apparatus  and a leather boxâ  this is the list which i made out  and which i had signed by vincent gardie and mrs  peolaineâ   reads â   four silver table spoons  four silver dessert spoons  two silver teaspoons  four silver forks  one leather box  containing two instruments for the ear  two pairs of white stockings   no mark on them  one pair of white socks  with  c 4  on each  one flannel jacket  another check jacket   which i have called an undress jacket    and a small quantity of tow or yarn  cross examined bymr  phillips q  it was about six o clock you came here yesterday evening  a  about six o clockâ  i came into court  and proceeded to the seat of the solicitorsâ  i saw you hereâ  i do not know mr  flowerâ  i knew you were one of the counsel for courvoisier william frederick moltino i am a printseller  and live in pall mallâ  it is my custom to fix upon parcels i send out a ticket of the address of my shopâ  this is one of my tickets upon this brown paperâ  lord william russell was a customer of mineâ  on the 27th of april i sent a parcel to his house for himâ  it was a print framed  called the vision of ezekielâ  it was inclosed in brown paperâ  to the best of my belief  theparcel i sent upon that occasion had a ticket on it like this  but i cannot say that i remember distinctly the act of putting the paper onâ  this label is similar to oursâ  it has on it  from j  a  moltino  printseller  20  pall mall â  it is not exactly a printed labelâ  we have a brass plate cut out  and we rub the ink over itâ  this appears to have been done so cross examined bymr  phillips q  be good enough to look at this letterâ  here is one letter i see remaining  do you see the letter m   a  i see some marks  but i cannot see what it isâ  it looks something like an mâ  i had been in the habit of sending his lordship engravings occasionallyâ  he had his house hung with printsâ  i have not sent him many during the last three or four yearsâ  i have several  perhaps half a dozen  but they were not all framedâ  i think the only print we ever framed  was the vision of ezekiel q  did you send the others with brown paper  or at all events  with the ticket with your name  a  yes  i think soâ  we generally use brown paperâ  i cannot tell bow long before the vision of ezekiel was sent we had sent an engraving to lord russellâ  it was some time mr  bodkin q  do you remember how you used to direct a pared of that sort  a  in directing a parcel of that sort  i should write   the right honourable lord william russell â  i have not a distinct recollection of the act of doing that with the vision of ezekielâ  that print was about four times the size of that bookâ   one on the table â  it could not have been inclosed in this sheet aloneâ  i sometimes pack articles in brown paper  which has been used on other occasions joseph vincent i know mrs  peolaineâ  i read something in a french newspaper yesterday  in consequence of which i went and spoke to mrs  peolaineâ  i signed this paperâ   looking at the list  henry carr i am an acquaintance of the prisoner sâ  i was a fellowservant of his in the family of mr  fectorâ  i think i have seen him wear a jacket similar to this   looking at the one in the parcel    in the service of mr  fector  but i cannot be positiveâ  i called on the prisoner on tuesday  the 5th of mayâ  i left the house about a quarter or twenty minutes before six o clockâ  he went out with meâ  i parted with him at the corner of park street  a very short distance from the houseâ  i saw nothing more of him that nightâ  i did not return to the house that night lettice banks i do not know the prisonerâ  i saw him onceâ  i have washed some shirts  stockings  aprons  and pocket handkerchiefs for himâ  these dirty stockings have the prisoner s mark on them  but i do not know that i ever washed themâ  they are marked in the heelâ  stockings are sometimes marked there  but i never saw any of his marked in the heelâ  his were marked at the topâ  i

the queen  and thereby traitorously made a direct attempt against the life of our said lady the queen  against his allegiance and against the statute   c theattorney general  thesolicitor general  sir frederick pollock  mr  wightman  mr  adolphus  andmr  gurney  conducted the prosecution samuel perks  i am a builder  i reside in london at the present time  and had done so one week before the 10th of june last  about six o clock n the evening of the 10th of june i was standing by the column under the portico of the north wing of buckingham palaceâ  i had gone there about half an hour beforeâ  i was standing waiting for the approach of the queenâ  i saw her majesty come out of the wooden gate of the north wing   i believe it is called the garden gate   in a low open carriage  accompanied by prince albertâ  the carriage turned to the left  up constitution hillâ  there was a postilion and four horsesâ  the top of the carriage about leached even with my foreheadâ  i am not acquainted with the name of itâ  it was a low open one with four wheelsâ  i was on the left hand side of the carriageâ  there were no military in attendance on the carriageâ  there were four out riders  two a little in advance  and the others a distance behindâ  there were no other attendants on the carriage  that i am aware of q  did you  on that day  see the prisoner any where  a  the first i saw of him was after the carriage came outâ  i turned short across the corner  up constitution hill  to get a second view of her majesty  and then i saw oxfordâ  he was on the right side of the carriage  on the footpath next the iron railing court  q  he was on the off side of the carriage  a  yes  on the right side mr  solicitor general  q  how near were you to him when you first observed him  a  on the opposite side of the road  about the same distance as from here to the opposite wall of the courtâ  he was walking along very slowly  with his arms folded under his breast  and his coat buttonedâ  he was in advance of the carriageâ  the carriage moved onâ  the prisoner gave a nod with his head when the carriage came on  he turned round  and gave a nod with his head in the direction of the carriageâ  he was then about ten or twelve yards before the carriageâ  the carriage was moving towards himâ  as the carriage advanced he continued to move in the same directionâ  i observed him the moment the carriage passedâ  i was about a foot behind the carriage  and from the singular way he nodded with his head previous to the advance of the carriage  it attracted my attentionâ  when the carriage had advanced  i ran in the direction of it  and the prisoner drew a pistol with his right hand from his left breast pocket  presented it at their majesties  and firedâ  i was just behind the carriage when he discharged the pistolâ  there was about one foot space between me and the carriageâ  i was within a foot of itâ  the prisoner was about five or six yards from the carriage when he discharged the pistol  and on the right side of itâ  the report of the pistol attracted my attention  and i had a distinct whizzing or buzzing before my eyes  between my face and the carriageâ  i was on the left side of the carriage  just at the back of her majestyâ  the prisoner was on the right all the timeâ  the moment he fired the pistol  he turned himself round  as if to see if any one was behind him  he then set himself back again  drew a second pistol with his left hand from his right breast  presented it across the one he had already fired  andwhich he bad in his right hand  and fired  at both times taking very deliberate aims q  what distance was the carriage from oxford when he discharged the second pistol  a  the carriage was then about three or four yards in advance of where he fired the firstâ  after the second pistol was fired  the two witnesses named lowe immediately ran  and joshua lowe seized hold of the prisonerâ  the lowes were somewhere behind me when i first observed themâ  at the moment of the firing  joshua lowe ran towards the prisoner  caught hold of him by the two arms  and albert lowe caught hold of the two pistols and wrenched them from the hands of the prisonerâ  a man named clayton came behind albert lowe  and seeing the pistols in his hands  thought he was the person who had committed the act  and said to him   you confounded scoundrel   i think were the words  and wrenched one of the pistols from lowe  upon which the prisoner exclaimed   it was me  i did it â  the carriage proceededâ  we took the prisoner along the road  and delivered him into the hands of two policemenâ  the two lowes and clayton helped to take himâ  i held the back of the collar of his coatâ  a great many were about at the time court  q  where did you find a policeman  how far had you gone  a  i suppose about twenty yards  between twenty and thirty cross examined bymr  sidney taylor  q  i think you say the prisoner was on the pathway  a  he wasâ  the pathway is very little elevated from the carriage roadâ  i suppose the footpath is about the height of the centre of the roadâ  it is very little elevated above that part of the road next the footpath  it is nearly levelâ  the channel is about six  or it may be eight inches deepâ  i do not think the footpath is a foot above that part of the roadâ  i do not suppose the channel is more than eight inches mr  solicitor general  q  is there any channel or gutter by the side of the pathway  a  yes  a slight oneâ  there is an iron grating very near where it occurredâ  the descent of the pathway into that channel is about eight inches court  q  it was an open carriage her majesty was riding inâ  did her majesty sit above the line of the carriage  a  yesâ  i suppose the line of the carriage was about the centre of her backâ  the whole of that would be exposed to the sight of any body behind the carriageâ  her majesty sat on the left  side  and prince  albert on the rightâ  he was nearest to the prisonerâ  the top of my head was about level with the top of the back of the carriage q  then the whole carriage was between the prisoner and you when he fired the first shot  a  i was exactly a foot behind the carriageâ  the prisoner stood on the right  just opposite joshua lowe  i am a spectacle makerâ  my place of business is in copthall courtâ  my residence is in london wall  i was in the park on the evening of the 10th of juneâ  my attention was attracted by the cortege of the queen and the carriage her majesty was inâ  i saw her majesty sitting in the carriage on the left sideâ  prince albert was on the rightâ  i was running by the side of the carriage on the left side  the wall side  the side on which the queen sat  and heard the report of fire armsâ  i was then about three yards from the carriage i should think q  were you in advance of it  or behind  or what  a  at the side  exactly at the side of the carriageâ  the noise attracted my attention in that direction  and i saw the smoke ascendâ  the carriage passed on a shortdistance  and then i saw the prisoner with a pistol in his right handâ  his right arm droppedâ  he turned round as if to see if any body was at his elbow  and to me it appeared that he pointed the second pistol across his right handâ  he fired it towards the carriage q  how long had he the pistol in that direction before he fired it  a  not an instantâ  my nephew was with meâ  i immediately ran across and seized the prisonerâ  my nephew seized the pistolsâ  some one came up i believe and took a pistol out of my nephew s hand at the time  and collared my nephew  upon which the prisoner said   it was i  it was me that did it â  i had at the time he said that  got hold of him by the collar and his armâ  we walked about twenty yards  and the policemen came up  and going along the road towards the station house  after the policemen had come up  i said to my nephew   look out  albert  i dare say he has some friends â  the prisoner turned round  and said   you are right  i have  â  i kept hold of him till we got down to gardener s lane station house  and then he was taken into the station house by the policemenâ  myself and two or three more had hold of him at the timeâ  i never let  go cross examined bymr  bodkin  q  did you see the queen s carriage leave the palace  a  i didâ  i should think it had got about a hundred and fifty yards  or it might be a little more  up constitution hill  before this occurredâ  the road is wider thereâ  the carriage was going slowlyâ  i had seen her majesty when the carriage left the palace and followed it for the purpose of seeing her againâ  i did not notice whether a good many other persons did the sameâ  there was a general rushâ  i was on the left hand sideâ  the garden wall of the palace is on that sideâ  it is not very high  about eight feet  or more than thatâ  i did not notice it particularlyâ  it is a wall of considerable heightâ  it is a brick wallâ  the footpath is on the other side of the road  and a very little channel divides the footpath from the roadâ  when i saw the prisoner he was standing on the footpathâ  i think the footpath is about six inches higher than the road  but the centre of the road is about levelâ  the queen s carriage was more in the centre of the roadâ  i believe there is a footpath on both sides of the roadâ  i think the carriage was in the centre as near as possible q  about what distance do you judge the prisoner to have stood from the carriage at the time you saw the smoke  a  about three yardsâ  the carriage was quite open  and was going at a slow paceâ  that three yards would be shortened i think about three quarters of a yard by stretching out his arm q  then the muzzle of the pistol would be within little more than two yards of the carriage  a  i should say soâ  he appeared to take a deliberate aimâ  when i saw him fire he was about a yard from the railing which encloses the green parkâ  the nearest gate by which any one could enter the  green park was about one hundred and fifty yards from where this happenedâ  the railing is quite open q  so as to afford an opportunity for a person to fire from the park side if he had chosen  a  if he had chosenâ  i did not observe what attendants her majesty hadâ  there were outriders  i think before as well as behindâ  i did not see the witness perks till after the occurrenceâ  i was on a slow run when i heard the discharge of the first pistolâ  i did not observe several persons running or walking on the same side of the carriage as meâ  i have no doubt there were persons about  but i did not see themâ  at the time my nephew was seized i had hold of the prisoner onthe pathway up against the railingâ  i had hold of him before he said   it is i â  he appeared desirous that it should be known he was the person who did itâ  we had got a short distance from where this occurred  when i told my nephew to be cautious  for probably he had friends q  either when the prisoner said   yes  i have friends   or at any other time in the transaction  did you see any persons whatever in his company  a  not in his companyâ  there were plenty had got hold of himâ  i had an idea at the time that the witness clayton was with him court  q  can you give any notion what distance of time there was between the firing of the two pistols  a  merely to turn round and to place his handâ  the carriage was moving onâ  i suppose at the last firing the carriage was about eight yards in advance of himâ  he fired the second pistol up the road  after the carriageâ  there were a few persons in front of the carriage albert lowe  i am the nephew of joshua lowe  on the 10th of june i was with my uncle on constitution hill in the parkâ  i saw her majesty come in her carriage from the palaceâ  i followed the carriage up the road and had not proceeded far before i heard the report of a pistolâ  my uncle and i were running by the side of each otherâ  i did not know from whence the sound proceeded  but turning my head round i saw the prisoner holding a pistol in the direction of the carriage  and he firedâ  that was the second pistolâ  i thought he held it in his right handâ  upon his firing the second pistol my uncle ran across the road with meâ  my uncle seized him  and i took both pistols from the prisonerâ  a roan came up  caught hold of me  and said   you confounded rascal  it was you  â  i had then the pistols in my handsâ  the man took one pistol from my hand the prisoner then cried out   i did it   or  it was me that did it â  something to that effectâ  we were going to take him to the station house  and the police came upâ  as we were going along  my uncle told me to look out  for be thought he had some friends about himâ  he turned his head round and said   you are right  i have  â  i delivered the pistol up which clayton did not take from me  to the policeâ  i do not know whether it was the one i saw fired q  can you tell how far the carriage had proceeded from buckingham palace when the first shot was fired  a  i thought about thirty yards  at first  but i have since been to see the place  and it is about 100â  i did not see the prisoner fire the first pistol  but when be fired the last he was about five yards from the carriage  i should think elizabeth stokeley  i am housekeeper to lord bexley  i was on constitution hill  on wednesday the 10th of june  going from the palaceâ  i was on the side next the wallâ  i did not see the queen s faceâ  i saw her carriageâ  my attention was first attracted by seeing the carriage approachâ  i turned round on seeing it approach  and saw the prisoner walking in this positionâ   with his arms crossed over his breast â  he was walking by the railing  on the opposite side to me  nearly oppositeâ  immediately on the carriage approaching i saw him draw his hand  and present  and then fireâ  i was not so near to the carriage then as i was afterwardsâ  it came on a few paces before the second fireâ  when he fired the first pistol i saw him change his hands  and immediately present the second pistol  and fire it q  in what direction did it appear to you that he presented the pistol  a  immediately opposite where the queen was sittingâ  the flash of thepistol came almost immediately over the queen s headâ  the queen was crouchingâ  she rather crouched  and the prince stoodâ  i think  to the best of my knowledge  the queen first rose  and by what i observed  the prince rather pressed her down  and it was immediately before the second pistol was fired that her majesty crouchedâ  it was the second flash which appeared to come over the queen s head  and it came close past me  the flash didâ  it seemed something that whizzed past my ear  as i stood  it seemed like something quick passing my ear  but what i could not sayâ  at the time the second pistol was fired i was very near to the queen s carriageâ  i was as close to the edge of the pavement as i could be  and the queen s carriage was coming along the centre of the roadâ  i was near as could be  within a yard of the carriage court  q  all this was at the second firing  a  yes mr  wightman  q  when the second pistol was fired  what did you see the prisoner do  a  i saw him drop his hands  and standâ  a gentleman rode up on horsebackâ  the carriage drove off a few paces  then stopped  and the gentleman rode up to the carriage and spokeâ  the prisoner was surrounded  and i saw no more court  q  where was the prisoner standing at the time the second pistol was fired  a  he was standing very near the carriageâ  he was on the opposite side of the carriage to me  on the railing sideâ  the second pistol was fired across the roadâ  he was facing the carriage  and backed to get his aimâ  he was more behind the carriage when he fired the second pistol cross examined bymr  sidney taylor  q  was there any person near you at the time  a  a little girlâ  from the time i saw this my attention was so fixed upon it that i saw nothing elseâ  i had not seen several persons about the carriage just beforeâ  i did not notice themâ  i saw the prisoner drawing the pistol  and my attention was fixed upon thatâ  the first thing  when i turned round  was the prisoner drawing his hand out with the pistolâ  i could not see how far in the rear of the carriage he was when the second pistol was firedâ  he was by the carriageâ  he was standing by the railingâ  perhaps he might be two yards in the rear of the carriage when he fired the second pistolâ  i observed a wall thereâ  i saw the second pistol pointedâ  i should say it was pointed right across towards the wallâ  i cannot tell how the first pistol was pointedâ  i did not take notice of the height of that wallâ  my back was towards itâ  i cannot say bow far i was from the wallâ  i was as far as could beâ  i was near the roadâ  i cannot say how far that is from the wallâ  there are several trees about thereâ  they are rather thick before the footpath on the left side of the wallâ  i could see the wall through the stems of the trees mr  wightman  q  you say the flash appeared to pass over the queen s head and before your eyes  a  no  not before my eyesâ  it came just over the head of the carriage  and whizzed past my ear q  what do you mean by the flash  a  the light and the smokeâ  i cannot explain what it was that whizzed by my earâ  it was my right ear william clayton  i am a cabinet maker  and live in princes street  leicester square  i was on constitution hill on the evening of the 10th of juneâ  when the queen s carriage approached i was standing about 200 yards from the marble arch of the palace  on the side where the wall is  the garden sideâ  i heard ft pistol firedâ  the carriagewas then about twenty eight yards from me  or it might be thirty  nearer to the palace than i wasâ  i was in company with my brother  and on hearing the report i said   good gâ  d  jack   and instantly ran off towards the spotâ  i crossed the road  and ran down to where i heard the reportâ  when i came abreast of the horses i heard a second reportâ  i was in the act of crossing the road when i heard the second reportâ  i ran on  i never ceasedâ  the horses stopped  and her majesty arose in the carriage  and looked round  with no fear on her countenance neitherâ  her majesty s back was towards the palaceâ  i was crying out   where are they who did it  â  i ran on and could not see how long her majesty s carriage stoppedâ  i did not see it goâ  i passed the carriage  and ran on to the spot where i saw the smokeâ  i saw two persons  one with his back to the railing  on the park sideâ  i inquired   where are they who did it  â  a female said   that is the man who did it â  she pointed to the two  but i judged it to be the man standing with his back to the railing  which was albert loweâ  i said   you confounded rascal  how dare you shoot at our queen  â  the prisoner heard me say soâ  he was nearer to me than albert lowe wasâ  i spoke in a loud voiceâ  the prisoner said   i did it  i give myself up  i will go quietly â  i took hold of his coatâ  the mob rushed in  and seized me  and knocked the pistol out of my hand on the groundâ  i stooped down to pick it up  expecting to resume my hold  when i was seized right and left  back and before  was kicked and torn  and my shirt collar out  and was taken into custodyâ  the police took me to the station house  where i was locked up in a cell and searchedâ  when i was brought from the cell i saw the prisoner in the inspector s officeâ  i asked for a draught of cold water  what with the struggling and the dust that was created  i felt a great wish for a drop of cold waterâ  the prisoner said   and i should like a drop of cold water â  i was walking up and down  and in passing him  be turned round and said   is the queen hurt  â  he turned his head towards me  and said soâ  i said to him   what did you put in the barrels  â  he said   i have answered a dozen questions  there have been a dozen persons asking me questions  and i shall answer no more  q  do you know what became of the pistols that were taken from him  a  there was a pistol lying on the table  one was brought in by the policeman  that was locked up with me in the cellâ  i took hold of that pistol which was lying on the table  saying   i have put my little finger into the muzzle of the barrel  and have wiped out the powder  and is there any here  â  i asked myself that questionâ  i put my finger into both pistols  but the one i first put my finger into i markedâ  that pistol came from the hands of albert loweâ  i took it from himâ  it was not taken from me when i was knocked downâ  it came on the ground  but i picked it up  and resumed my hold againâ  one part of the time the policeman had it  and at another time i had it  but it never went out of my sight till i had marked itâ  the police made their appearance  i should judge two minutes after the first shotâ  i had got the pistol before the police cameâ  i can say that the pistol i marked was one of the pistols taken from the prisonerâ  it was in the hands of both the prisoner and albert loweâ  this is the pistolâ   looking at one â  there is a mark on the barrel court  q  how far is the place where you seized albert lowe and the prisoner from the carriage  a  fifteen or eighteen yards from where the carriage stoppedâ  the second pistol was fired when i was abreast of thehorsesâ  the carriage drew across the road immediately on the second pistol being firedâ  the pulling up of horses  going at the rate of six or eight miles an hour  would take six or seven yardsâ  i should say the second pistol was fired the distance of full eight or ten yards from the carriage charles brown  i am a policeman  on the afternoon of the 10th of june  i was on duty at buckingham palace  about six o clock i was sent on an errand to the south wingâ  i saw the queen s carriage going up constituation hillâ  i was in front of the steps at the south wingâ  shortly after i saw the queen s carriage i heard a shot firedâ  i immediately ran towards where the sound proceeded fromâ  it appeared to me to proceed from constitution hillâ  as i went towards the spot i met a gentleman on horseback  who spoke to meâ  my attention was attracted by a mob of people  who had hold of a personâ  before that a second shot had been firedâ  it was after i heard the second shot that the gentleman on horseback spoke to meâ  i was going towards the carriage when i heard the second shotâ  i ob of people having hold of the prisonerâ  the two lowes had hold of him  and several others besidesâ  on my coming up  several voices  i do not know whether it was the lowes  said   this is the man  and i laid hold of himâ  nothing more was said by the persons presentâ  the prisoner said   you have no occasion to use violence  i am the person  i will go quietly  â  i had merely laid hold of his collar and his left arm when he said thatâ  i proceeded with him to the station houseâ  shortly afterwards some person remarked   perhaps there might be more of them â  the prisoner replied   i have friends  â  smith  a policeman  came up  we went in front of the wellington barracks  and as we got opposite the barracks some person said   i wonder whether there was any balls in the pistols  or no â  the prisoner made answer   if the ball had come in contact with your head  if it was between the carriage  you would have known it â  i took him to the station house  and he was searched by me and another constableâ  the other constable took from him  in my presence  a key  a knife  and 2s  6d  in silverâ  i have the keyâ  i found a piece of wadding in his trowsers  pocketâ  i looked at it  and saw the mark of the hammer on one side and the cap on the otherâ  i asked him what it was forâ  he said   to prevent the pistol going off   as he did not wish to hurt himselfâ  it would prevent the pistol going off  by putting it between the hammer and the capâ  it had been so usedâ  he also said  if i was to go up to the park  where it occurred  i should find the other piece of waddingâ  while i was in the inspector s room different gentlemen came into the roomâ  a question was put   i cannot say whether it was to the prisoner   whether there were any balls in the pistolsâ  the prisoner said there were balls in the pistolsâ  next day i made search in the garden  on the other side of the wall  but was not able to find any thing cross examined bymr  sidney taylor  q  now when the question was put  as to whether there was any ball in the pistols  how many policemen were in the room  a  i cannot sayâ  i do not think there was any body but the inspector and myselfâ  there were a number of gentlemen there q  had various persons been asking the prisoner questions  a  not asking the prisoner questions  but asking one another  as they came in q  do you mean to say  that questions were not put to the prisoner himself  a  not by the parties while i was thereâ  i did not hear any one put questions to him except the inspectorâ  he asked him questionsâ  he asked his name and where he came fromâ  i believe he asked him something about the pistols q  is it the practice of the police  to whom you belong  to interrogate prisoners as to the fact of any crime with which they are charged  a  i believe notâ  the inspector merely asked him where he came fromâ  he was not interrogated by the inspector  in my presence  as to whether there were balls in the pistolsâ  he asked where he got the pistols fromâ  the question about the balls was not put to the prisoner  but the gentlemen asked whether the pistols were loaded with ballâ  the prisoner was not asked the question  he was in custody at the time q  you say he stated there were balls in the pistols  what were his words  a  as near as i can recollect  his words were   the pistols were loaded  q  he did not say there were balls in them  but the pistols were loaded a   there were balls in the pistols  q  the pistols were loaded    were those his words  a  no  not exactlyâ  he distinctly said there were balls in the pistols q  he said they were loaded  were those his words  a   the pistols were loaded with balls   those were the words  as near as i can judgeâ  i will not swear to the exact wordsâ  i cannot tell the exact height of the wall of the gardenâ  i should say it was eighteen or twenty feet highâ  i searched in the gardenâ  i made a very minute searchâ  not all over itâ  within about 100 yards in length  and about twenty five in breadthâ  what i should suppose to be the range of the pistol ballâ  i did not find anyâ  i searched on the other side of the wall for a short timeâ  about two hours after the firingâ  the police sergeant and three or four men were there when i searchedâ  i assisted in the search for a short timeâ  i stopped there for about a quarter of an hour q  what mode of searching was used  a  we kept moving over it with our hands  and then swept it with a broomâ  that search extended about twenty five yards in length  and five or six yards in widthâ  there was no ball found in the dust while i was thereâ  i did not see all the dust siftedâ  it was taken down to the palace  and sifted thereâ  i saw it brought down to be siftedâ  i did not make any further searchâ  there are several trees about thereâ  i was not examined before the privy council  and have not stated any thing before the privy council as to balls in the pistols q  had you told any body before the examination by the privy council  that you had heard the prisoner state the pistols were loaded with ball  a  yes  i told mr  maule  the solicitor court  q  how many people were there in the room at the time he said there were balls in the pistols  a  from ten to twelve personsâ  he said it out loudâ  he was in my custody at the time  in one corner of the roomâ  i should think he said it loud enough for other people to hear as well as meâ  the people were talking as to whether there were balls  one said   i wonder whether there was one   and he said   there was  charles smith  i am a policeman  i was on duty on the 10th of june  at buckingham palaceâ  i remember the queen coming outâ  shortly after the queen came out  i heard a noise  which attracted my attentionâ  it proceeded from the direction of constitution hillâ  i did not proceed towards the spot from whence the sound came  till i heard a second reportâ  it was like the report of fire armsâ  i then proceeded to the spot  and saw the prisoner there  in the custody of charles brownâ  lowe had hold ofhimâ  i saw a pistol in young lowe s handâ  i proceeded towards the station house with the prisonerâ  going along  i asked where the pistols wereâ  as we were going in front of the palace  young lowe pulled one from his bosom  and said   here is the pistol â  i said   take care of it â  some one in the crowd asked if the pistols were loaded with ballâ  the prisoner made answer   if your head had come in contact with the ball  you would have found there was a hall in the pistol  cross examined bymr  bodkin  q  was not the phrase   if your head had been at the head of the pistol  you would have known whether it was loaded or not   a  it was notâ  somebody in the crowd asked if the pistols were loaded with ballsâ  the answer was   if your head had come in contact with the balls  you would have found there was ball in the pistol â  those were the very wordsâ  brown was thereâ  i have no doubt he heard it william smith  i am a policeman  i was in the green park on the 10th of june  in the middle of the parkâ  it is separated from constitution hill by a railingâ  my attention was directed to the  carriage as the queen was passingâ  i heard the report of a pistol  and saw the smoke of itâ  i hastened to the spot  and saw a number of people running in that direction  and i saw the prisoner present a pistol  and fire it towards her majesty s carriageâ  i was fifty or sixty yards from the carriage at the time the second pistol was firedâ  i ran  and got over the railingâ  they are iron palisades  about five feet high  or more  with spikes at the topâ  i had some difficulty in getting overâ  i hurt my hand in getting overâ  the prisoner was then in custodyâ  the witness clayton had a pistol in his possession at the time  and i took him into custody  to the station houseâ  i took the pistol away from himâ  he was put into the cell  and was there about five minutesâ  i then commenced searching himâ  inspector baites came in  and commenced searching himâ  he took out his card  and gave it to the inspectorâ  i then gave the pistol into his hand to mark  and he gave it into the hands of the inspector cross examined bymr  sidney taylor  q  when your attention was directed towards the carriage  did you see any out riders  a  yesâ  i did not notice where they wereâ  whether before or behind  or on one side the carriageâ  i have been in the police almost twelve monthsâ  there were not many people near the carriage when my attention was directed to it  but afterwards there wereâ  i cannot tell how many there were at firstâ  people were scattered about on constitution hillâ  the people were very anxious to get a sight of the queenâ  there were not so very many there at firstâ  i cannot give any idea about how many there wereâ  i saw the prisoner present the second pistol  and fire itâ  he was ten or twelve yards from the carriage when he fired it  on the right side of the carriageâ  the pistol was presented in a slant direction towards the top of constitution hillâ  i did not search afterwards for the bullet frederick garrett  i am in the employ of mr  william hayes  who is a general salesman  he has two shops  in blackfriars road  where i attend as shopman  i remember the rumour of the queen having been fired atâ  about three weeks or a month before that i saw the prisoner at our shop in blackfriars roadâ  he bought a pair of pistols and a powder flask of meâ   looking at the pistols â  these are the sort of pistols mr  hayes was in the habit of keepingâ  this has mr  hayes s private mark on itâ  we had such pistols as that recently arrivedâ  these are the pistols thatwere parted with to the prisonerâ  i asked him two guineas for them  they were marked two guineasâ  he said he wanted to know what distance they would carryâ  i said  about twenty or thirty yardsâ  he said  if i would take two sovereigns he would have themâ  i said  if he would not give more i must take itâ  he then asked about a powder flaskâ  i believe i took one from outside the shopâ  he gave me two shillings for thatâ  i also gave him two bags to put the pistols inâ  these are the bagsâ   looking at them â  i know them againâ  this is the powder flaskâ   produced â  i had never seen him before that day  to my knowledgeâ  he was about ten minutes bargaining for and paying for the pistolsâ  i had such observation of him as to be quite sure of him when i saw him againâ  i knew the pistol bags and powder flask again when they  were producedâ  they were brought to me about three days after the queen was shot at  and i knew them again immediately cross examined bymr  bodkin  q  you do not tell us the exact day this bargaining took place  a  i entered it on the slate when they were bought  and mr  hayes took it off the slate and entered it in the bookâ  no one was present in the shop besides myselfâ  i think it was before one o clock in the dayâ  the prisoner was alone mr  adolphus  q  when you serve in that shop your master is at the other  a  yes william sampson hayes  i keep a shop in blackfriars road  where fire arms are sold  i have also another shop  i keep a day bookâ  i have not got it hereâ  i had no order to produce itâ  i remember hearing of the queen being fired atâ  i heard of it the same dayâ  i do not know how long before that it was that i made the entry in the day bookâ  it was before thatâ   looking at the pistols â  here is my private mark on these pistolsâ  i take the entries which i put in my book off the slateâ  they are entered by the young man on the slate  and next morning i copy from the slate into the bookâ  that is my usual courseâ  i remember an entry being made on the slate of a pair of pistolsâ  that was on monday  the 4th of may john joseph gray  my father keeps a shop at no  10  bridge road  lambeth  i assist him in his business  i am the principal there  we sell  among other things  caps for pistols  i remember the prisoner calling at our shop  on either tuesday or wednesday  the 3rd of june lastâ  he brought half a hundred caps of meâ  he asked if i kept bulletsâ  i told him no  but recommended him to a gunsmith in the boroughâ  he wanted to know if i had any small canisters of gunpowderâ  i had  and i showed him our half pound canistersâ  he said they were not small enough  he wanted a small canister  he should like a quarter of a pound  if he couldâ  he tried four or five of the caps while he was with meâ  he only showed me one pistol  but i believe he had a pair with himâ  i found some caps that fitted itâ  i had known the prisoner some years back  in the same road where i am living nowâ  i had been to school with him  but for bow long i cannot sayâ  to the best of my recollection it was eight or nine years agoâ  when he came into the shop i feigned not to know himâ  he asked me if my name was not john grayâ  i told him it wasâ    well   he said   don t you remember any one of the name of oxford  â  i said   yes  i certainly do  i went to school with a person of that name â  he said   well  i am the same â  i asked him what he had been doing with himselfâ  he said he had then lately come from birmingham  but he had been in the public line court  q  how long were you at school with him  a  i cannot say  i did think i was at school with him for about a twelvemonth  but my schoolmaster came forward and proved he was only there five weeks  i might have been mistaken by his once being a neighbourâ  i cannot say how long i have known him  it is so many years ago  it is impossible for me to say  i was very young at the timeâ  i lived about twenty houses on the opposite side of the way to him  in westminster bridge road  he lived about twenty houses lower down  nearer the marsh gate q  you say you feigned not to know him when he came in  what was your reason for that  a  i did not wish to make up the acquaintance again with himâ  i did not observe any thing odd in his appearance  not the least sir henry wheatley  i am keeper of her majesty s privy purse  when i heard of her majesty being fired at  i went to the station house where the prisoner was in custodyâ  i saw him in the cellâ  he came forward when the door was opened  and asked me   is the queen hurt  â  those were the first words that were spokenâ  lord uxbridge was with meâ  some conversation ensuedâ  we asked him in what situation he wasâ  he stated he was a bar boy  and had been out of place about ten daysâ  i do not recollect that he said any thing about a pistol  or about the shootingâ  he said he had come into the park at four o clock  and had seen the prince come from woolwich  at least  he supposed if was from  woolwich court  q  that was between six and seven o clock  a  about half past six the earl of uxbridge  on the 10th of june i saw the prisonerâ  from the opening of the cell door  where i found him  he addressed me by saying   is the queen hurt  â  i said   how dare you ask such a question  â  he said he had been in a public house in oxford street for  about four months  and had left it about a fortnightâ  he said he had been shooting a great deal latelyâ  a very good shot with a pistol  but a better shot with a rifleâ  he said the pistols had been given to him on the 3rd of may  and something else also  which he went on to inform us was money  and  he could have as much of it as he pleasedâ  i then said to him   you have how fulfilled your engagement â  he replied   no  i have not â  i said   you have  sir  as far as the attempt goes â  to that he was silent cross examined bymr  bodkin  q  did sir henry wheatley remain with you during this conversation  a  during the first part  but he retired into the officeâ  i went to the station house immediately on hearing of the occurrenceâ  there were one or two policemen thereâ  it is a very narrow passageâ  i think sir thomas freemantle came in  and a gentleman  who i afterwards heard was mr  thistleâ  no question had been put to the prisoner before he asked whether her majesty was hurtâ  what followed was in answer to questions generally put by myselfâ  he was probably not aware that i was an officer in the queen s householdâ  i did not mention who i was  nor did sir henry wheatley in my hearingâ  there was no reluctance whatever to answer the questions which i put to him samuel taylor  i am acquainted with the prisonerâ  i have known him about twelve monthsâ  i recollect the rumour of the queen being fired atâ  i saw the prisoner the evening before thatâ  he showed me a pistol  and said he had been firing at a targetâ  he did not say when or where he had been firing at itâ  he showed me nothing except the pistolâ  i asked whether it was loadedâ  he replied that it was loaded thomas greenwood lawrence  i live in victoria street  white conduit fields  and am a perfumer  in the employ of delacroix  of bond street  i know a public house in oxford street  called the hog in the poundâ  it is at the corner of south molton streetâ  i know the prisonerâ  he was barman to mr  robinson  the proprietor of that public house  when i first knew himâ  it might be about february when i first knew him as barman thereâ  on easter sunday i went with him and one roach to hyde park  about four o clock in the afternoon  from four to half past fiveâ  at hyde park corner i said to the prisoner   i suppose the people are looking for the queen â  he replied   they will be disappointed  as she is at windsor â  we got back to the hog in the pound about half past five o clockâ  roach and curling were in company with usâ  i believe the prisoner quitted the hog in the pound about the let of mayâ  i have frequented that house for the last two years  up to the present timeâ  one evening  after he had left the service  he was in the parlour there  and he said he had lost a half sovereign on a bet respecting the shot at the bull s eye  at the shooting gallery in leicester squareâ  he showed me a flattened ballâ  i beard a person named roach remark that he was more fit to shoot at a hay stack than at a target the honourable john oliver murray  i am brother to lord eli bank  i was on constitution hill on wednesday afternoon  the 10th of june  on horsebackâ  when the first pistol was fired the prisoner was close to me  as near as he is now  or very little furtherâ  after the report of the first shot my horse plunged up into the air  being a very high spirited animalâ  i saw the prisoner put his hand into his breast  draw out a second pistol  and take a most deliberate aim  in the direction of the queen s phaeton  which was about fifteen or twenty yards from where i wasâ  as soon as i got any power over my horse i tried to prevent his firing the second shotâ  when he did fire it i was as near to him as i am nowâ  he stood with his back to the railing  with a smileâ  some persons came over the park  and down constitution hill  and seized himâ  he did not offer the slightest resistanceâ  i immediately afterwards looked at the wallâ  i was the first person that went to the wallâ  i noticed a mark which i supposed to be the mark of the bulletâ  it was a white mark on the dark wall  as large as the palm of my handâ  at that time colonel fox came upâ  i pointed it out to him  and to lord belfast alsoâ  the mark was about five feet from the ground  and rather in a slanting direction from where the prisoner stood q  did it appear to you such a mark as a bullet would have made  a  i have not the slightest doubt of it  in my own mind cross examined bymr  bodkin  q  did you not observe any other mark on the wall  a  there was a kind of angular mark on the wall  but a very old oneâ  it was near this markâ  i took notice of that to mark the spot q  have the goodness to describe what kind of mark this was  a  the wall was darkâ  it was a white round mark upon that wall  as a bullet would makeâ  it was much larger than a bulletâ  it was as if a piece of the brick was knocked out by the force of the ball  or whatever made the markâ  i looked about on the ground for the bullet before any one came  but found none  but being fired in a slanting direction it mightâ  q  did you find any piece of brick  a  i did not look for anyâ  i was looking about the ground for the bullet mr  attorney general  q  i do not know whether you have beenaccustomed to see marks made on a wall by the firing a ballet against it  a  i have  frequentlyâ  the first shot was fired in a slanting direction  the second shot was almost before meâ  the carriage never stoppedâ  it went on up constitution hill  in the direction of grosvenor place court  q  was the place on the wall as big as the palm of your hand  a  i think nearly as largeâ  that would be nearly the whole flattening of the bulletâ  the ball would be a perfectly flat surface if it made so large a mark as thatâ  i should say the piece of brick was broken by the force of the bullet on the wall the honourable william owned stanley  i was in the park on the 10th of june lastâ  i was coming straight down in the direction where the shot was fired  from the reservoir at the top of the parkâ  it might be about two hundred yards from the spotâ  my attention was called by hearing the report of one pistol first  and a few seconds afterwards a secondâ  as soon as i came down to the rails i tried to get over  but could not for the spikesâ  i then asked what had happened  and asked the bystanders whether there were any marks on the wallâ  i got to the wall about ten minutes afterwardsâ  i have tried since  and it took me about seven minutes to walk roundâ  i have had frequent experience in the mark that a ball would make going against a wallâ  i saw a mark which in my opinion was decidedly such as might have been made by a bulletâ  i have not the pleasure of knowing mr  murray cross examined bymr  sidney taylor  q  have the goodness to describe what sort of mark this was  a  it was rather longer than wideâ  it appeared to me that the bullet had struck thereâ  i could see the part where the bullet bad struck  and a chipped brick  which had broken off about an inch and a halfâ  where the bullet struck it appeared to be circularâ  i examined other parts of the wall  and there appeared to me to be another mark about fourteen yards from that  not quite a similar mark  it appeared to me to be fresh  and such a mark as might have been caused by a bulletâ  i examined about twenty yards on either side  but could find no other mark q  after you had seen these two marks on the wall  did you examine whether there were any bullets underneath the places where the marks were  a  it would have been no useâ  i did examine  hooked down on the ground close to the marks  but found no bullet thereâ  there were three little chimney sweepers thereâ  sir john eustace was with meâ  he examined alsoâ  he walked round with me  and there was an old artillery man thereâ  he examinedâ  he found no bulletâ  he agreed with me q  the artillery man  you  and sir john eustace searched for the bullet  and found none  a  cannot say that i did search for the bullet  for being in an angular direction  the bullet would have glanced offâ  i looked down  but no moreâ  i was looking down for a few seconds by each markâ  i looked down to see if the brick that had chipped off had dropped belowâ  i did not look to see if there was a bullet  because i did not think it likelyâ  i did not see any policeman there at the timeâ  some came up before i leftâ  they did not searchâ  i did not speak to themâ  it was no useâ  they did not search while i was there  to my knowledgeâ  the wall is  i suppose  fourteen or fifteen feet high thereâ  i did not search in the garden sir frederick pollock  q  could you form any judgment in what manner the bullet would be likely to strike the wall  a  yesâ  it appeared to me to have been an angular strikeâ  the moment i came up iasked what had happened  and in consequence of what i heard i did not look for the ball in the immediate neighbourhood court  q  in your opinion decidedly the mark in the wall was produced by what  a  i have no doubt whatever in my own mind that it was produced by a bullet fired from a pistol john william linton  i live with my father in the waterloo road  i am a playmate of the prisoner sâ  i was never at school with himâ  i remember hearing of the queen having been shot atâ  on the monday previous to that the prisoner called on meâ  about a month before that i had been to the strand with himâ  i cannot remember our conversation when he called on me thenâ  he asked me to go with him to the shooting gallery in the strandâ  he showed me some pistolsâ  he did not show me the pistols the first time he called to ask me to goâ  he called one day to ask me to go  and i went with him the next dayâ  he showed me the pistols the day we went to the galleryâ  they were very handsome pistolsâ  they were carved on the stockâ  i did not notice how they were mountedâ  he said a friend had lent them to himâ   looking at the pistols produced â  i almost think these are the pistols  but i could not swear to themâ  to the best of my knowledge they areâ  i went to the shooting gallery in the strand with himâ  he there shot at the targetâ  he had half a dozen shotsâ  the people at the gallery provide the ballâ  when he called on me the monday before the queen was shot at  he showed me the pistolsâ  they were the same i had seen beforeâ  he said he had been at a much better shooting gallery than the one we first went toâ  he did not say where it wasâ  i understood it was over the waterâ  i mean over the thamesâ  we were then in the waterloo road  and he meant over the water  on the westminster side of the thames court  q  where were you when the conversation took place  a  at my own home in the waterloo road  over the riverâ  i understood him to mean on the westminster side sarah packman  i keep the house no  6  west place  west square  the prisoner lodged at my house  and had done so i think six or seven weeks before the queen was shot atâ  his mother had been there about three monthsâ  his mother took the lodgingâ  she was there the whole of the time except when she was at birminghamâ  she went to birmingham full a month before the queen

eveningâ  i went into the front room one pairâ  it was openâ  i found this box thereâ   producing it â  it was lockedâ  i opened it with a chisel and hammerâ  i afterwards tried this key to it  and it fitted itâ  i found in it this sword and scabbard  four books  a black crape cap with two red bows  a powder flask containing about three ounces of gunpowder  a razor  a bullet mould  two pistol bags  a memorandum book containing four papers  i also found five bullets  and twelve or fourteen percussion capsâ   producing the articles â  the bullets that were cast by that mould fitted the pistolsâ  i cast one  and tried it  and it fitted the pistolâ  the bullets that i found loose would roll into the pistols  but they were rather smaller  and did not appear to be cast in that mouldâ  i took the box and the articles to the station houseâ  i showed them to the prisonerâ  hesaid the box was his  and the things that were in itâ  he saw the pocket book and the papersâ  he said those were his alsoâ  he said be intended to have destroyed them in the morning before he went out  bat he had forgotten themâ  the papers were folded up in the pocket book as they are nowâ  they were not pinned

yards from the wall to the railing opposite  in rather a slanting direction court  q  the foot of the wall is lower than the road  a  it would make about a foot differenceâ  that would be about eight feet four inches from the roadâ  i saw a mark on the wallâ  that is exactly six feet from the foot of the wall  or about five above the level of the road james brown  i was an outrider attending her majesty  on the evening of the 10th of juneâ  there were two more outriders attending her majestyâ  her majesty had no other attendants from the palace to the place where she was shot atâ  the two equerries went across the garden from the door  and came out at the gate from constitution bill  leading from the garden to the roadâ  i was behindâ  the other two outriders were before her majesty s carriageâ  my horse s head was not above a yard from the carriage when the first shot was firedâ  when the last shot was fired i was close by the side of the prisonerâ  as i looked round from the report of the  first pistol he was just firing the nextâ  i was about the same distance behind the carriageâ  i was close to it  within about a yard of itâ  i was in the centre of the roadâ  it was smallish man that fired  respectably dressed  in a brown coatâ  i was trying to turn my horseâ  two or three persons had got hold to the prisoner  and i followed on with her majesty to her royal

voluntarily signed that statementâ  this is the statement he signedâ   read â    the prisoner says   a great many witnesses against meâ  some say i shot with my left  others with my rightâ  they vary

remember in what year he diedâ  i should think it is about eight or nine years ago  but i cannot say to a certainty q  in the latter part of his life what was the state of his mind  a  the latter part  i think  was better than it was beforeâ  the first part of his life  i think  was very unsoundâ  i formed that opinion by his behaviour and his ways of going onâ  he was raving mad at one timeâ  that was about 1799â  i was obliged to put him under restraint thenâ  i was obliged to put cords on himâ  he was in the countryâ  i was assisted by three persons in doing itâ  it required the strength of those persons to confine himâ  i never saw him confined by a strait waistcoatâ  at the time i speak of he was confined in the country  just by petworthâ  he was put in petworth bridewell  and kept there a fortnightâ  he was put there for being unsound  for careâ  i did not see him thereâ  we took him to the magistrate  and he sent him thereâ  he was there a fortnight  and was sent out

the time he was confined he broke the windows  and smashed every thing in the houseâ  the things were not his own  but my father sâ  he was down there thenâ  his wife came down to my father s  and he came down to herâ  at the same time he threw a couple of clocks down in the room  and smashed them to piecesâ  his wife was obliged to go from my father s to another house to be protected from himâ

jumping about  like anybody quite goneâ  he was after that admitted into greenwich hospitalâ  i cannot say whether there is apart of the hospital where lunatic patients are keptâ  i saw him at the hospitalâ  he was in the queen s wardâ  i never saw him in the infirmary cross examined bymr  attorney general  q  how old was he when he married your sister  a  i cannot say  i suppose between twenty and thirtyâ  i did not know him before thatâ  i became acquainted with him two or three years after his marriageâ  he was given to drink a good dealâ  i believe it was after those drunken bouts that he displayed a violent turnâ  i do not think he lived very happily with his wife  but i cannot sayâ  i took him before the magistrate at petworth  for throwing down and breaking the things in the house  and threatening our livesâ  he wasallowed to go at liberty from the bridewell  on promising to go to londonâ  i saw no more of him for some yearsâ  he continued his habit of drinkingâ  he went

had not been taking liquor as when he had q  do you remember any thing particular that happened  to show the state of mind in which he was  a  i think it was soon after i was marriedâ  the very day that edward s father was twelve months old  he came to me and made a very great disturbanceâ  he broke the furniture and the clocks  and tore down the table clothâ  it weight be owing to liquorâ  he was taken up and put in petworth gaolâ  they took him on horseback to gaolâ  i think three men took himâ  nothing was done to him before he was takenâ  i once saw a strait waistcoat put on him  in

have two men with himâ  he was fastened down to his bed at that timeâ  he was not fastened to his bed more than a day  but the strait waistcoat was kept on between a week and a fortnightâ  a medical man was called inâ  i think it was mr  atkins  a surgeon  living at deptfordâ  i do not know whether he is living or dead nowâ  the straight waistcoat was kept on several days after the medical man had seen himâ  at the end of the time i have mentioned  he got better  and went to sea again  after some timeâ  as well as i can remember  about a couple of months elapsed between the attack and his going to seaâ  i never knew him in the royal naval asylumâ  i knew him in the collegeâ  he was a pensioner  he was under the care of sir richard dobson  for a complaint in his head  after he was admitted at greenwichâ  i firmly believe the attack in his head affected his mindâ  i saw him in the hospital at the latter part of his lifeâ  his bodily health was very good  until within the last fortnightâ  his intellect appeared very steady the latter part of his time  the last fortnightâ  for the last few years of his life  i was a great deal away at brightonâ  i was not with him till

not suit them  and then he turned into a great rage  and got in liquorâ  he was not tipsyâ  he was about two days at my father s house when this happened q  what was the treat they would not have  which made him so angry  a  he had high notions  and he thought they ought to have paid him that homageâ  he thought they did not behave well to himâ  when be broke the things  they sent him to

his lieutenantâ  i had a brother named peter  who i believe was younger than myselfâ  he had a complaint in his head which caused his head to be lightâ  i believe he was put into the naval asylum for

confinedâ  he took no other situation till he went to seaâ  he went in the royal navyâ  when he was at greenwich college he used to say he was the pope of rome  and he would hoist his halbert over his shoulderâ  his duty while on guard was to open and shut the gateâ  i did not observe that he carried any armsâ  i believe he did notâ  he would sometimes say he was st  paulâ  that was when at the gate  and when he came home tooâ  i never heard him say he was st  peterâ  dr  henderson attended him  at deptfordâ  he bad no doctor at the time he talked about being st  paul and the popeâ  i never

and say he would cut his throat in my presence if i refused himâ  i have at other times seen him with pistols and poisonâ  he would show me the paper with oxalic acidâ  at the time the princess charlotte was lying dead  he followed me out of the house with a double barrelled pistol loaded with slugs  and said if i refused to have him he would blow his brains out before my face  and i promised him thenâ  i never said i would have him before thenâ  upon that threat i for the first time said i would marry himâ  we were married on the 28th of april in the following year  1818â  i had made the promise in novemberâ  a variety of circumstances took place between the time of my giving the promise and the time we were marriedâ  he would come to my father s  and when my father would not serve him with liquor  he would send out for it to other houses  and he would offer to pay other people s scoresâ  he was then  i should say  the worse for liquorâ  i remember the day before we were married  a person had written to his master to inquire his character  and it was not satisfactoryâ  it arrived that dayâ  i then told him i would not be married to himâ  on my telling him that  he went into a violent rage  pulled out a roll of bank notes and the license  and burnt the notesâ  i then said i would be marriedâ  the notes were entirely consumedâ  on another occasion he took some bank notes  twisted them round his finger  lighted them  threw them on the ground  and watched them burn outâ  they were bank notes of his ownâ  his conduct did not improve after marriageâ  he would promise if i would marry him he would keep it a secret  as i was married without the consent of my parents  but he quarrelled with my mother  and then disclosed the circumstance of my being married to himâ  it was before we were married that he burnt the bank notesâ  twice before we were married he burnt bank notesâ  the bundle he burnt the day before our marriage was in consequence of my refusing to have himâ  the others he burnt after i promised to have himâ  he wished me to have the money to purchase furniture  and said   will you have it  â  i would not  and he then burnt the notesâ  there was a very large roll of notesâ  i do not know precisely the numberâ  he was earning on an average ishould say 20l  a week at that timeâ  he was very skilful at a workman  and very quickâ  he was a gold chaser  which at that time was a very lncrative employmentâ  he was considered the best in birmingham q  do you remember at any time his making an attempt upon his own life  a  i doâ  frequently  before our marriageâ  one night he was picked up by the watchman outside the door  and there were a great number of people thereâ  i  knowing what he had threatened  was very much alarmedâ  he was found by the watchman in the street with a razor in his handâ  i was in my mother s houseâ  he was brought in  and i saw himâ  the watchman had the razor  and gave it to my motherâ  he was crying at that time  and teemed very despondingâ  we had seven childrenâ  the prisoner was the third childâ  the first child is livingâ  at the time i was pregnant of the second child  my husband s conduct was dreadful  brutalâ  he neglected me to that i fainted three or four times a day for want of foodâ  he once broke a jug  and threw a piece at meâ  it would have cut my face  but i held up my arm and it cut my armâ  i have the wound nowâ  he annoyed me dreadfully by grimaces while i was pregnant of my second child  and by jumping about like a baboon  and imitating their grimacesâ  that continued during the whole period of my pregnancy of the second childâ  that child was barely born aliveâ  it was a confirmed idiot  and its countenance was precisely as the father looked when he made those grimacesâ  it put its tongue out like he didâ  it lived about between two years and four months  not quite two years and a halfâ  during all that time it had not the least appearance of reasonâ  it never spoke or walkedâ  it was very voraciousâ  it showed no indication of sense or reason at allâ  i continued to suckle that child after the birth of the prisonerâ  it took to the breast two or three days after this boy was bornâ  its cry was not humanâ  it was a sort of moanâ  it was not like a child criesâ  i suckled that child and the prisoner togetherâ  my husband s conduct was much the same during my pregnancy of the prisoner  grimaces and so onâ  i was in tears one day when a lady called  she said   what is the matter  mrs  oxford  â  i said   he is commencing the same faces he always has done   and she told him it was very wrong of himâ  he once struck a file into my breast  and the milk flew out from the woundâ  there was a stream of milk on the floorâ  that was before the birth of the prisoner  it was whilst i was suckling my first child  and on observing the milk come from the wound  he showed the same indifference that he always didâ  i had not had any quarrel with himâ  he was always tormenting meâ  he delighted in annoying and teasing me q  did you do any thing to provoke him to these extraordinary acts  a  noâ  i was considered too patient  and too attentive to himâ  i was blamed by my parents and many personsâ  he kept a horse at one time  and i have seen him bring the horse into the house  he led it in by the bridle  and he seemed  like a child with a toy  amused at his own follyâ  he brought it into the sitting room  and led it aboutâ  i have frequently applied to him for money for the support of the family  which he has refused  and abused me  and he once knocked me down  and fractured my headâ  i had done nothing more than ask him for money to support the familyâ  i knew he had received many pounds that nightâ  he put 2s  on the tableâ  i said i could not do without moneyâ  he was perfectly soberâ  it was between seven and eight o clock in the eveningâ  i believe it was before the birth of the prisoner that i received the blow which fracturedmy headâ  i cannot say whether it was at the time i was pregnantâ  he cut my head with a quart pot  while i was pregnant with the prisonerâ  he threw it at me  and it cut my straw bonnet through  and cut my headâ  i did not know my head was cut till i felt the blood coming downâ  i do not remember  how far advanced in pregnancy i was then q  was your mind ever at all affected by any violence done to you by your husband  a  when asleep i screamed  and i was obliged to be awoke up in my dreamsâ  that was when my head was fracturedâ  i was carried in by several persons  and when they dressed my head  i attempted to walk  but could not  my head turned round with giddinessâ  that was the day it was doneâ  i was dangerously illâ  i was obliged to have my head shaved and poulticedâ  mr  partridge the surgeon can tell when that was better than iâ  i believe he is hereâ  i remember one day walking with my husbandâ  he left me  saying  he had a box to go off by to morrow  and he must go and finish itâ  he left me at my mother s  on telling me thatâ  after that i went home with the servant and child  and found the house locked upâ  it was not opened to meâ  i went back to my mother sâ  it was afterwards opened  and part of the goods were removed  the house in confusion  and my husband goneâ  he was taken by the authorities of the town next morning  in the act of leaving birmingham  for londonâ  i had not had any quarrel with him at that timeâ  not a word or sentence of angerâ  when i saw him afterwards he did not give me any explanation of his conduct  but he came into my father s house and asked me some questions  which i answered himâ  the persons sitting by wondered how i could speak to himâ  he went away again immediatelyâ  he continued in birmingham for some weeks  and then went to dublin  where he stopped four months  leaving me and my children with my motherâ  at the end of the four months he returned  and sent for me to a lodging house  i of course put out my hand  expecting he would be glad to see me  but he pushed me from himâ  he said nothing particular  only be seemed annoyed at my looking better than when he left meâ  he said soâ  i have heard him reasoned with by his friends as to his conduct  and he said  if any one persuaded him to do any thing  be would act directly oppositeâ  he did not appear to be capable of seeing the folly and wickedness of which he was guiltyâ  he would laugh in the most triumphant manner  and he had i should say  an almost supernatural look with him when he had done wrong  and when i was distressedâ  the day i was put to bed with the first child he kicked me violently because 1 did not agree to something which he proposed to me to doâ  i have known him take poison twice  i believeâ  once he took laudanum  and he was very ill for several days afterwardsâ  he was at my sister s house the same day that he took it in the afternoon  and she spilt half of itâ  he kept his bed several days in conesquenceâ  dr  birt davis was called in in consequenceâ  my husband died on the 10th of june  1829â  i have seen my husband s father several timesâ  i saw him on the occasion of my husband s death  and the night before he was buried  he said he was determined to lie by the side of his dear boy and he was then in a putrid state  in his coffinâ  i had been obliged to burn vinegar for the last two or three daysâ  his father did not appear to be in a sound state of mindâ  he reproached me for having my husband opened without getting any thing in return  which was very unnatural  i think  in a fatherâ  his conduct was very eccentric on other occasions when i saw himâ  he had a great many peculiarities  the prisoner was born onthe 19th of april  1822â  for the first seven years of hit life he was under my care q  did you observe any thing remarkable about him from his infancy  a  yes  he would burst out crying when there was no one near him  and no one speaking to him  and he was always very troublesomeâ  it was different to the mere waywardness of childhoodâ  if he sat still or stood still  he would burst out cryingâ  that was after he had learned to walk as well as beforeâ  all children cry  but this was when he was three or four years old  and he has continued to do so through life  to cry without any apparent causeâ  i have known that to be the case up to the time of my going to birmingham  or just before thatâ  that was in the present yearâ  he had a great many other very singular habitsâ  he would get into a violent rage without any cause  he would deliberately break any thing  and willfully destroy any thing that he took in his handâ  he once pointed a pistol at me  that was the first day he brought them homeâ  i should have told you that my husband  during my pregnancy with the prisoner  pointed a gun at my headâ  the prisoner was particularly fond of fire arms and gunpowderâ  i have frequently taken it from him when he was youngâ  he would sometimes play about with other children  and at other  times he would amuse himself with letting off cannons  and he was once very much burnt with gunpowder all over the faceâ  he was very much hurt  that is eight years ago this summerâ  he was at play in the yard with a little boy  and the cannon exploded  and he was very much burntâ  his eyebrows and eye lashes were burnt off  hit hair was very much singed  and his face was a complete massâ  i sat up two nights to wash it with a lotionâ  it was very much hurtâ  he behaved very fractious indeed  and screamed terribly  so that the doctor was angry with him  and gave him a sleeping medicineâ  when i first saw him  after he had burnt himself with the gunpowder  he was crying dreadfullyâ  i was absent at the time  and when i returned i found him washing his face with water q  has he any habit of laughing  a  i have frequently beat him for it when he was much youngerâ  that habit has continued up to the present timeâ  he would laugh hysterically after these gloomy fits and fits of violent passionâ  it is an involuntary laughâ  i told mrs  robinson so the day he leftâ  he was in the habit of alarming me dreadfully  by making strange noises  firing off cannons  and flourishing a great stick before his sister s face  and before the looking glassâ  complaints were made to me by the customers of his laughing  and if i asked him to do any thing when i was in business  be would make such a disturbance  that it used to distress my feelings dreadfully  and annoy the customersâ  i was at that times keeping a pastry cook s shop in the westminster road  but he has annoyed them since then at a coffee house which i afterwards tookâ  when the gentlemen have been reading the newspaper  he has made such a dreadful disturbance that it was very annoying and very distressing to my feelingsâ  the customers complained of itâ  i shut him in the cellar  on one occasion  when i kept the pastry cook s shopâ  the customers came to complain of himâ  i lost a great many of them in consequenceâ  i lost my business entirelyâ  at times he was very affectionate  and at other times the contraryâ  he would break out unawares  and if he wanted any thing  and it was not reached him in a moment  lately  he would strew the room with litters  and throw every thing down that came in his wayâ  he was sometimes very gloomyâ  he would sit  for a long time with his hand tohis head  and not speak  and he would be impatient if i spoke to him  especially if he was reading  and we spoke to him  he would get in a violent rageâ  i went into a situation at mr  prescott s  the bankers  as confidential housekeeper  and was there a year and a halfâ  i saw the prisoner occasionally during that timeâ  i placed him with a person named sandon q  after you left mr  prescott s  and he came from sandon s  did these peculiarities appear to have subsided or increased  a  increased considerablyâ  i could not manage him at allâ  he broke windows to the amount of 29s   and he used to jump on the sofa  and throw the pillows about  and destroy things wilfullyâ  that is eight years agoâ  since that time he has been under my own observation until the last four years  and then he has only been with me for a week or a month occasionally  having gone out to situationsâ  he was with my sister at hounslow first for about two yearsâ  she then kept a public houseâ  she does not nowâ  he then went to mr  minton s  at the shepherd and flock  in london  and from there to mr  farr s  in wilderness rowâ  when at home he was in the habit of going on the roof of the house and throwing at people as they passedâ  he was brought home one night by a policeman  who informed me he had been taken to the station houseâ  he had got behind a carriage  and frightened a lady who was in it by making a great noise  and she was pregnant  and her husband  who was a solicitor  was exceedingly alarmed and angryâ  that was stated in his presenceâ  i went next morning to inquire after the lady s health  and apologizeâ  he took no notice when he heard this accountâ  he did not appear conscious of having done wrongâ  he used to look very indifferently about all these thingsâ  i think this was somewhere about six years ago  between five and sixâ  when he was at home of late  i knew of his having no companion but master linton  who has been examinedâ  he never  to my knowledge  belonged to any club or any meetingâ  i left london for birmingham about four weeks and three days  i think  before this occurredâ  at that time he was out of placeâ  he had left his place just a week before i went to birminghamâ  he received 20l  a year wages where he had beenâ  he did not purchase the clothes he has on with that moneyâ  he has had that coat a long time  he had it just as mrs  minton died  more than two years agoâ  he then had a suit of mourning given him  consequently this coat was savedâ  he has had it in his possession full two years  i should sayâ  i do not know whether it is so much as two yearsâ  i should say he has had these clothes nearly two years q  how lately has any thing occurred between him and you in allusion to macbeth  or any thing of that kind  a  he has always been talking in that manner  repeating parts of plays  from a very little boy  and we used to imitate him because he said it so badlyâ  he wanted to go to sea last winterâ  he wanted me to go to birmingham for 50l  to provide him as a midshipmanâ  i told him of the folly of his going to sea when he knew nothing about nautical affairsâ  he said he should have nothing to do but to walk about the deck and give ordersâ  i said   but you must first learn navigation â  he said he would allow me half his pay  and how proud i should be of my son when i saw his name in the papers  admiral sir edward oxfordâ  when he brought the pistols home  i said  how could he think of laying his money out in such folly  and he said they were not hisâ  he was saving them for a young manâ  i do not know whether there was any thing in the pistol when he presented it at meâ  he had only just then brought them inâ  he has behaved violently towards meâ  the daybefore i went to birmingham he made my nose bleed by a blow from his fistâ  i was playing with him and turned round  and he hit me on the noseâ  that was not in the course of the playâ  it was afterâ  he turned round suddenly as he was going through the door  and struck at meâ  it hurt me very muchâ  i screamed outâ  the landlady came up stairs  and she said   if i was to strike my mother i should expect my hand to drop off â  he appeared very sullen q  you know his hand writing  of course  a  yesâ   looking at the paper headed  rules and regulations  found in the prisoner s box â  i believe this paper is his hand writingâ  all that is his writingâ  i have received two or three notes from him since he has been confinedâ  i have seen him write many timesâ  i have no doubt whatever these are his hand writingâ  these three notesâ   looking at them â  are also his handwriting cross examined bymr  solicitonr general  q  about this nose bleeding  did he tell you it was an accident  and did you tell mrs  packman that you thought it was an accident  a  i did  because i did not like to appear so severe with himâ  my parents on many occasions witnessed the threats that my husband made to me before our marriageâ  his threats of what be would do to me if i did not marry himâ  the courtship continued  and i afterwards did marry himâ  i do not know the amount of the notes which he burntâ  it was a very large roll of notesâ  i am sure they were notes  because the birmingham notes were very much soiled  and i could tell their appearanceâ  my son  the prisoner  went to school when he was a very little boyâ  walters  i think  was his first schoolmaster s name  i am not quite sureâ  when he went to a master s school i was not thereâ  it was while i was at the situation at mr  prescott s that he was sentâ  i lived in mary ann street  birmingham  at the time of his birthâ  he continued under my care till three months after his father s deathâ  he was seven years old thenâ  he bad been to a small school in the neighbourhood where i livedâ  my husband kicked me at the time of my confinementâ  that was not the occasion upon which my father said he would prosecute himâ  that was when i was in such a dangerous state with the second childâ  i was taken home a month before my confinement  or else there was every reason to suppose i should not have recoveredâ  it was on that occasion my father said he would prosecute himâ  i cannot say exactly how long the prisoner was at school at walter sâ  he next went to mr  robinson s  in the newcut  lambethâ  that is about eight years agoâ  mr  walters was in birminghamâ  he was at mr  robinson s several monthsâ  mr  robinson used to come and complain of his inattentionâ  he next went to a school at camberwell  and remained there a few monthsâ  there were the same complaints then of inattention and wildnessâ  i do not think he went any moreâ  when i was at mr  prescott s  he was placed with george sandon  of birmingham  who married a niece of mineâ  he was there twelve monthsâ  my father had the care of him after thatâ  he remained with my father till eight years agoâ  i do not exactly know how long he remained with my fatherâ  it could not have been much more than a twelve monthâ  part of that time i was with mr  prescott  and the other part in the westminster bridge road  in business as a confectionerâ  when he left my father he came to me in the westminster bridge road  and resided with me till he went to his aunt s at hounslow  four years agoâ  he was barman at his aunt sâ  he continued with her till she failed in business  till he went to mr  minton sâ  the duty of a barman is to serve liquor at the bar  andreceive money  and account for itâ  he went to mr  minton s from his aunt sâ  he was in the same situation there  as barmanâ  he lived there twiceâ  he received wages at his aunt sâ  he lived about four or five months with mr  minton the first timeâ  he then came to my house for a short time  and mr  minton had him back againâ  i cannot say how long he remained there the second timeâ  i should say more than six months  or about six monthsâ  he had 20l  a year thereâ  his next employ was at mr  parr s  in wilderness rowâ  he remained there till mr  parr left the house  and remained a short time with the persons who succeeded mr  parr  to initiate them in the business  for which he received a sovereign  i believeâ  he then came home for a short time  and then went to mr  robinson s  in oxford streetâ  he gave mr  robinson notice  and afterwards he staid for a short time to oblige mr  robinson  till he suited himselfâ  i went there for the first time the very day he left  and asked for himâ  mrs  robinson said he had leftâ  i was rather alarmed  and said   when did he leave  â  she said   not above an hour ago â  i said   i hope he has given you satisfaction â  they said   in every thing but laughing â  i said   he cannot help it  for i have often boxed his ears for it â  i did not hear any complaint from mrs  robinson of his breaking the things  but i have often beard it from himselfâ  when he was going to leave mr  minton the first time  i went to know the cause  and he said he made such mistakes in giving change  he liked him in every thing but thatâ  mr  minton is aliveâ  he is not hereâ  the barmaid isâ  it was two or three weeks  i think  before he took him againâ  it was in consequence of the other barman leavingâ  i cannot tell how long exactly he remained the second timeâ  i believe he was recommended from mr  parr s to mr  robinson sâ  my boy told me soâ  i never went to visit him at mr  parr sâ  he went to his aunt s four years ago this summerâ  during that four years  with short intervals he has supported himself in those services q  what were those noises that you speak of that he made at the coffee house  a  why he would cry and roar  like a boy that had been beaten  if i asked him to do any thing  and i put him in the cellar once  and locked him inâ  i have frequently corrected him at other timesâ  i have been compelled to beat him when he was much youngerâ  he was in the habit  as a child in play  of using cannons and gunpowder  occasionally hurting himselfâ  my daughter and i were so much alarmed once that we were both ill by the loud report of a cannonâ  we took it from himâ  i gave it to a lady who was there  and who is now deadâ  he was in the habit of using those kind of thingsâ  the last place he lodged at was in west placeâ  i forget the name of the solicitor who took him to the station house for frightening his ladyâ  the lady lived in camberwell groveâ  i went there next morningâ  i believe it was a gentleman s cabâ  he got up behind  and made a great noise in the lady s faceâ  he put his face round from behind the cab  while the lady and gentleman were riding homeâ  the gentleman immediately gave him in chargeâ  i do not know whether he was acquainted with a lad named roach  or smith  or grayâ  i do not know either of thoseâ  i know lintonâ  the prisoner associated with the lads in the neighbourhood of the westminster roadâ  he had been home a week and a day  when i went to birminghamâ  i left him in the lodgingâ  i think he brought the pistols home on the tuesday or wednesday after he leftâ  i intended to return to west placeâ  i did not intend to stay so long when i wentâ  i desired that he would look out for another placeâ  he said nothing was stirring  and he should rather wait till a good place offereditself  than answer advertisementsâ  i did not propose that he should advertise  or answer advertisementsâ  i got him his first place  and he got himself the others  adjourned  friday  july 10th  1840 the queen against edward oxford â   continued  mary sumner  i am a widow  and live in church row  houndsditch  my husband was a jeweller  and lived in norfolk street  birminghamâ  i knew the prisoner s father there in 1820â  we lived exactly opposite him in the same streetâ  i had frequent opportunities of observing himâ  the first thing i saw singular about him was on an occasion when he rode into his own parlour on his horseâ  his wife was screaming  and i went over  and saw him riding round  on horsebackâ  i  of course  considered he was not right in his mindâ  i observed peculiarities in his conduct on many occasionsâ  once at dinner he threw the meat and vegetables out of windowâ  i was present at the time  and saw itâ  i was in my own house oppositeâ  my husband and i have frequently said to ourselves that he must be out of his mindâ  that was the general opinionâ  i have very frequently observed peculiarities of conduct in him  though i cannot exactly call them to mindâ  we always considered his acts more the acts of a madman than any thing elseâ  he came from birmingham to london with us in 1820  and there he stopped several weeks  and his actions then were more like a mad man than any thing elseâ  my husband was obliged to tell him he must return  for we could not be troubled with him any longer cross examined bymr  attorney general  q  did he drink a good deal  a  i never saw him drunk  or approaching to isâ  i have seen him take a glass of wine and beer very frequentlyâ  he used to come to our house  and we were in the habit of seeing him  and when we were in london for three weeks he came to our house daily q  was he not a very bad husband  a  why  they used to have little broils  i believeâ  i was not aware that he was a very good husbandâ  i think notâ  i do not knowâ  i believe he was not a good husbandâ  on one occasion he sold the goods during his wife s absence for a few minutesâ  he used his wife very harshly and ill continually  during the time we were in birmingham  and after we left i heard he still continued to do the same court  q  did you ever know him to be attended by any medical man  a  no charles marklew  i live in birmingham  and am brother to mrs  oxford  i bad opportunities of observing the conduct of the prisoner s fatherâ  i had the care of the prisoner and his sister when they were youngâ  the father came one morning to see themâ  he kissed both the children when he went outâ  he looked through the window  showed me a bottle  and before i could get out to him  he swallowed the contents of the bottleâ  i picked up the bottle  and i could tell by the smell that he had swallowed laudanumâ  the bottle was empty when i took it upâ  it was full beforeâ  i called him a fool for acting in that wayâ  he was taken very illâ  i desired he would try to throw it up off his stomachâ  he tried to do so  hut could not do itâ  i got him to bed  and informed his friends of itâ  a car was sent for  and i took him home to his lodgingâ  after that dr  birt davis was sent for to attend himâ  i always considered that he was in a mad state ever since i knew him cross examined bymr  solicitor general  q  pray  when he came and kissed the children  did he say any thing about the laudanum before he went out  a  not a wordâ  he took leave of the childrenâ  he had always been in the habit of ill using his wife  and they were parted through thatâ  he did not tell me what he was going to do  nor where he was goingâ  he was not at all affected in taking leave of the children  he seemed sorryâ  i did not ask him where he was goingâ  i asked him no questions whateverâ  he and his wife had been parted  perhaps two or three weeks thenâ  he was a gold chaserâ  he carried on that business at birmingham some years  perhaps two or three yearsâ  i cannot say exactlyâ  he came to live in london soon afterâ  he never resided in birmingham after that timeâ  he came to visit the childrenâ  that is allâ  he stopped two or three hoursâ  he did not sleep or live in the house court  q  did you live in london at this time  a  no  in birmingham  but oxford never visited birmingham after he left dr  john birt davis  i am a physician  and reside at birminghamâ  i am also a magistrate of the county  and am coroner for the borough  i attended the husband of mrs  oxford on one occasionâ  he was labouring under symptoms of poisoning by laudanumâ  i may have seen him twice or thriceâ  i cannot tell which  but j believe i saw him twiceâ  it was in 1824â  sixteen years agoâ  i have no doubt i directed proper remedies to be administered to himâ  he recoveredâ  i can hardly say whether i considered him in danger when i saw himâ  i do not recollect the estimate i took then of his exact dangerâ  i have been practising as a physician from the year 1823â  i do not think i had ever seen him before that occasionâ  i never saw him afterâ  the two occasions on which i saw him did not afford me any sufficient opportunity of judging as to the state of his mindâ  i heard at that time of his odd conduct to his wifeâ  representations were made to me of his conduct by othersâ  i have been in court during this trial q  have you formed any opinion of the sanity or insanity of the prisoner  a  i have formed an opinion q  supposing a person in the middle of the day  without any suggested motive  to fire a loaded pistol at her majesty  passing along the road in a carriage  to remain on the spot  to declare he was the person who did itâ  to take pains to have that known  and afterwards to enter freely into discussion  and answer any questions put to him on the subject  would you refer such conduct to a sound or unsound state of mind  a  if to that hypothesis were added what i deem a proof of hallucinationâ  court  q  the question is  whether upon those facts alone you should judge a person to be insane  a  i should judge him to be insane upon those facts alone  but i should be stronger in that opinion if i was permittedâ  q  you mean to state  upon your oath  that if you heard those facts stated  you should conclude that the party must be mad  a  i do q  without making any other inquiry  a  yesâ  taking this into consideration  the absence of motive  the absence of precaution  the deliberate owning  and the free discussion afterwards  of his own conduct  criminating himself in that way immediately afterwards  with the danger staring him in the face mr  bodkin  q  suppose  in addition to those circumstances  it was shown  that just before the transaction  the party had written these papers which you have heard read  would that conduct strengthen  or otherwise the inference that you have already told us you draw  a  it would greatly strengthen the inference cross examined bysir f  pollock  q  i collect from what you have said  that you have no distinct recollection of the remedies you prescribed to the prisoner s father  a  i have notâ  i have seen many cases of poisoning by opiumâ  i should say a dozen cases  i cannot rely on my memory for the treatment of that particular caseâ  i did not make any minute of the caseâ  i was called in within a few hours after the laudanum was takenâ  i do not recollect the particulars of the caseâ  it is mainly impressed upon my recollection by the fact of the man being a man of colour  and his residence q  i collect from that  the only particulars you do recollect  are  that sixteen years ago you attended a man of colour  who had taken laudanum  a  that is about the sum of my recollectionâ  i received the information that he had taken laudanum  from othersâ  i cannot say whether he survived the effects of the laudanum by the assistance of any excitement or stimulant  or whether it was removed from his stomach by an emeticâ  i have no recollection of the particulars of his case q  as a medical man  you are perfectly aware that a large dose of laudanum  may be taken without producing death  if a party is stimulated  and kept in motion by counteraction  a  the majority of such cases would recover  when properly treated  when treated in the usual wayâ  he was drowsyâ  i am sure of thatâ  i was not able to form any notion whatever of his state of mind q  you have answered some hypothetical questions put by my learned friend opposite   mr  bodkin  i beg to ask you whether you give that answer from your knowledge  as a physician  or from your experience as a coroner  or as a magistrate  or merely as a member of society  a  i answer as a physicianâ  i think the circumstances which have been supposed  have  medically speaking  a tendency to prove insanity court  q  we do not exactly understand what you mean when you say medically  a  if  as a physician  i was employed to ascertain whether an individual was sane or insane  in whom i found those facts  i should undoubtedly give my opinion that he was insane q  as a physician  you think every crime that is plainly committed to be committed by a mad man  a  nothing of the kind  but a crime committed under all the circumstances of the hypothesis q  what are the circumstances in the crime itself  which you think show madness  a  the crime is committed in open day  it being obviously of great magnitude and danger  of great atrocity  it is committed without any precaution  without any looking out for the means of escape  it is afterwards spoken of openly  so far from concealing the criminating facts  facts which might afford a chance of escape  the existence of the balls is acknowledged  the free discussion of the circumstances  the absence of motiveâ  by the free discussion  i mean a free

blister on their arms  which is something more than common with children  and at other times he would get up to the room window and throw things outâ  at other times he was very much addicted to laughing and crying  both at a time  and when i asked him why he did it he would say  in fact he would give me no straightforward answer  he would say he did not know  and would ran away from me

reckless of the consequences  are you as a medical man prepared to say whether those circumstances taken together in the commission of the crime  indicate a sane or unsound state of mind in the criminal  a  by themselves i should consider they were circumstances of strong suspicion  but other facts should be sought before one could be warranted in giving a positive opinionâ  those would be facts leading to a strong suspicion that the party was insaneâ  if it should also appear that there was a previous delusion  that would certainly strengthen the caseâ  supposing there was inherent insanity in the family  my opinion  grounded on cases which have occurred  would be strengthened that the individual was insaneâ  striking cases are on record court  q  do you say that all insanity is hereditary  a  no  i have not said so mr  sidney taylor  q  are there instances on record of persons becoming suddenly insane  whose conduct has been previously only eccentric  a  certainly there areâ  supposing  in addition  that there was previous delusion in the mind  my opinion would be that he was unsoundâ  such a form of insanity exists and is recognised cross examined bymr  sir frederick pollock  q  what form of insanity do you call it  a  lesion of the will  it has been called by le mare  insanity connected with the development of the willâ  i should not consider a headstrong person to be under such an influenceâ  i mention lesion of the will  as a term under which a highly reputed writer on insanity has chosen to designate a form of insanity  in which sometimes flagitious acts  sometimes only eccentric acts  are committedâ  it means more than a loss of control over the conductâ  it means morbid propensityâ  moral irregularity is the result of that diseaseâ  i suppose in some instances there areother indications of the diseaseâ  i do not know that there are notâ  i should think it most likely there would be  if the individual was sufficiently watchedâ  that is a fair conjecture  but the case not coming under my own observation  it is impossible i can give an answerâ  i have had cases under my observation  in which i suppose this form of insanity existed  one case in particular  that person was in perfect healthâ  i do not think i ever met with a case where the only apparent symptom was moral irregularity  where i had no medical indication of physical diseaseâ  i think that  committing a crime without any apparent motive  is an indication of insanityâ  doing any thing of any sort  without any motive  is not an indication of unsoundness of mind in every instance mr  sidney taylor  q  do you not make a difference when a man has to suffer the penalty of death for the act  a  certainlyâ  the species of insanity which dr  le mark calls lesion of the will is a well recognised species of insanity court  q  do you conceive that this is realty a medical question at all which has been put to you  a  i doâ  i think medical men have more means of forming an opinion on that subject than other personsâ  i am supported in that opinion by writers on the subject  by lours  and by le mark  who i have alluded to  who is a particularly eminent writerâ  my reason for thinking so is  because it is so stated by those writers q  why could not any person form an opinion whether a person was sane or insane from the circumstances which have been referred to  a  because it seems to require a careful comparison of particular cases  more likely to be looked to by medical men  who are especially experienced in cases of unsoundness of mind q  what it the limit of responsibility a medical man would draw  a  that is a very difficult pointâ  it is scarcely a medical questionâ  i should not be able to draw the line where soundness ends and unsoundness beginsâ  it is very difficult to draw the line between eccentricity and insanity john conolly  esq   m d  i am physician to the hanwell lunatic asylum  i have 850 patients under my careâ  i have had some experience in the treatment of disorders of the mindâ  i have seen and conversed with the prisonerâ  in my opinion he is of unsound mind cross examined bymr  attorney general  q  when did you see him  a  the day before yesterday  for the first timeâ  i saw him on that occasion  and i have been in court the whole of yesterday and this morningâ  i never saw him in private more than onceâ  that interview lasted perhaps half an hourâ  a person who is unsound need not  in all cases  be under the care of some personâ  it depends on the character of the insanityâ  there may be individuals who may be at large  and associate with others  and still be of unsound mind q  do you consider there is any danger in the unsoundness you have discovered in the prisoner  a  certainly i doâ  dr  chowne  mr  clark  and a gentleman who i am informed is mr  maule  the solicitor of the treasury  were with me when i examined himâ  he did not exhibit any violenceâ  he replied willingly to the questions i put to him  but his answers were very unsatisfactoryâ  he seemed to have a very indistinct impression of the circumstancesâ  he knew he was to be triedâ  when i spoke to him of his trial  wishing to see what impression it made upon him  on two occasions he said   what trial  when   and subsequentlyhe seemed to know the trial was about to take place the next day  and what it wasâ  i asked him if he was not conscious that he had committed a great offence in shooting at such a young and interesting person as the queenâ  he said   oh  i might as well shoot at her as any body else â  i did not take notes of the conversationâ  it was so short an interview  and so few questions were put  it seemed to me unnecessaryâ  i went there with the view of being a witness on the trial if required q  tell me any answer that was unsatisfactory  a  without recollecting the whole conversation  i cannot pretend to do soâ  i am unable to recollectâ  when i asked him if he was not attached to his mother and relatives  and whether he did not think it would very much distress them that he should be brought to trial  and condemned  his reply was   yes   he was attached to themâ  when i asked whether he thought it would affect them or distress them  he said he did not knowâ  when i said he might possibly be condemned  he said he did not knowâ  he answered indifferentlyâ  i do not remember any other question  the answer to which was unsatisfactory  not so distinctly as to take on myself to repeat it q  how long before had you notice that you were going to see oxford with a view to ascertain his state of mind  a  on the evening beforeâ  i made some notes when i got home of my observation of him  of the general result of the impressions of my mind  not of the questions i put or the answers i receivedâ  i did not ask him to do me a sum in arithmetic mr  bdkin  q  are these the notes you refer to   producing them  a  yesâ  they were not made on the same dayâ  i examined the prisoner s headâ  it appeared to me that the formation of the anterior part of the head would indicate an imperfect development of a certain portion of the brainâ  i frequently find that form of head in insane personsâ  there are many persons of that form of head who are not insaneâ  my notes were written as soon afterwards as i could possibly write themâ  they are very briefâ  they were not made with any intention of being read â   reads  â   a deficient understanding  shape of the anterior part of the head  that which is generally seen when there has been some disease of the brain in the early period of lifeâ  an occasional appearance of acuteness  but a total inability to reasonâ  a singular insensibility as regards the affectionsâ  an apparent incapacity to comprehend moral obligations  to distinguish right from wrongâ  an absolute insensibility to the heinousness of his offence  and to the peril of his situationâ  a total indifference to the issue of the trial  acquittal will give him no particular pleasure  and he seems unable to comprehend the alternative of his condemnation and execution  his offence  like that of other imbeciles who set fire to buildings   c  without motive  except a vague pleasure in mischiefâ  appears unable to conceive any thing of future responsibility  court  q  of course in that conversation you had with him you were watching his manner as well as what he said  a  certainlyâ  my judgment is formed in part by his manner  as well as by what he said q  did you try to ascertain whether he was acting a part with you or not  a  i tried to ascertain it as well as i possibly couldâ  my judgment is formed upon all the circumstances together dr  chowne  i am a physician of charing cross hospital  i have been a physician twelve or thirteen yearsâ  i am lecturer in that hospital on medical jurisprudence q  if you heard of a person committing a crime without the ordinary inducements to crime  either revenge or interest  and that crime exposes him to loss of life  and he seems reckless of consequences  and delivers himself into the hands of justice  and appears wholly exempt from any thing like consciousness of responsibility for the act  what opinion should you form of that state of mind  a  i should consider it an exceedingly strong indication of his being in an unsound state of mindâ  a propensity to commit acts without an apparent or adequate motive under such circumstances is recognized as a particular species of insanity  called in medical jurisprudence  lesion of the willâ  i do not know a better termâ  it is an old termâ  it has been called moral insanity  may i be allowed to give you an example  it is by no means an uncommon thing for me to have patients who complain to me that they are impelled with a strong disposition to commit suicide  of the madness of which act there can be no doubt  and yet there is no one symptom about those people indicating mental disease  there may be a slight degree of general indisposition  but no symptoms at all of any mental irregularity  these patients will say   i have nothing to complain of  i have no unhappy news  i have no disappointment  i have no unsatisfied wish  my husband  if the case be so  is kind to me  i have nothing at all to impel me to the act but a strong impulse â  i have been asked to prescribe for such cases  not in one sex only  but both in men and women q  now  in that sort of mental disease  is it quite consistent with the person performing the functions of life and the duties of life with accuracy  a  there is no doubt of it  they can perform the duties of life with accuracy  i do not say with the same facilityâ  i saw the prisoner in newgate the day before yesterday  by permission of the secretary of state  in company with dr  conolly  mr  clark  and mr  mauleâ  i had some conversation with him q  now  from the conversation you had with him  and the opportunity you had of observing him  what is your opinion as to the state of his mind  a  i should consider his state of mind is essentially unsound  there seems a mixture of insanity with imbecilityâ  i regard the incapacity of controlling laughing and crying  as proofs of imbecility  not as positive proofs in themselves  but as assisting to form my opinion cross examined bymr  solicitor general  q  this propensity to suicide in the patients you speak of  were they persons performing all the duties of social life  a  they were persons proceeding with their duties of life  and in all their ordinary avocationsâ  despondency of mind is very often connected with disorders of the stomach  but it very often happens that the physical cause has not been obvious  and has not developed itself at all  it is not at all necessary that the physical cause should be obviousâ  in such cases  i prescribed for disease in the stomach  i found those remedies did operate on the mindâ  laughing and crying without control is connected with hysteria  and also with imbecilityâ  generally  when connected with hysteria  it is associated with the sensations  there must be fainting and globus hystericus  which arises in the throatâ  the questions put to the prisoner were not numerous  some were put by one gentleman  and some by another  i endeavoured to impress upon him that he was labouring under error when he considered it was incapable of being proved there were balls in the pistols  i assured him  in a manner i thought most likely to make him believe  there really were that the fact of there being balls in the pistols would be proved against him  that his responsibility was a terrible one  and in all likelihood it would end in capital punishment  and if he knew whether that was decapitationâ  he said he had been decapitated in fact a week before  for he had a cast taken of his headâ  i endeavoured to make him understand it would be proved that there were balls in the pistolsâ  i knew he had the impression that it could not be proved  from questions asked by myselfâ  i cannot tell what he had said to induce me to form that opinion  but something was said to that effect by himâ  i concluded  from something he said  that he entertained that opinionâ  he insisted that there were no balls thereâ  the fact did not occur to me beforeâ  i do not remember his words  but the remark was to the effect that it was impossibleâ  the question as to whether he was not concerned about his mother he treated with indifference  and seemed to be totally destitute of feeling  apprehension  or thought on the subjectâ  during the whole time i was struck with a very peculiar mannerâ  he was not an instant  though i believe it is partly habit  that he was not playing with a pencil and a piece of indian rubber  with which i found him drawingâ  when we went into the room he was quietly drawing  with a pencil on a piece of paper  something like a landscapeâ  during the whole conversation he was leaning with his head on one hand  with the other flapping about with a piece of indian rubber  sometimes clapping one pencil against another  in fact  a manner entirely without acute feeling or acute consciousness  and in order to ascertain how fax what i would call dullness of manner  that peculiar manner  might indicate idiotcy even  i desired him to get up and walk  and if i had supposed that he was acting when he was clapping the indian rubber about  that idea would entirely have been done away with by the manner in which he walked across the room  which he did with a great deal of lightness  liveliness  briskness  and smartness  not at all as if endeavouring to put on a peculiar mannerâ  it occurred to me that it was perfectly natural  not as if he was acting or making the least pretenceâ  the interview lasted  perhaps  about three quarters of an hourâ  i did not make any note of the conversation  neither at the time or after court  q  would it not have been wise to note the time of going and coming away  a  perhaps it would  but i did not use that precautionâ  mr  maule was present during part of the examination  not during the wholeâ  he came in during the latter partâ  i was in court all yesterday q  did you form any opinion at all from the prisoner s manner during the trial  a  i didâ  i considered that manner was a continuation of the same kind of manner  but under some restraint hereâ  i have no observation to make as to the form of the headâ  i also subjected the prisoner to what is called the arithmetical testâ  i infer nothing from itâ  i merely mention it because it did occurâ  he was pretty ready in casting up  but not ready in subtractionâ  i am not quite certain whether at the moment he was giving his attention to it  indeed i consider it is a fallacious test james fernandee clarke  i am a practising surgeon  and have been so between three and four years  i am surgeon to the dorcas charity  and honorary secretary to the westminster medical societyâ  i have had some experience in the treatment of insane persons  such as usually falls to the lot of the general practitioner  perhaps a little more  for having been so short a time in practiceâ  i have been in the habit of attending the family of the prisonerâ  i have known him nearly two yearsâ  i accompanied dr  conolly and dr  chowne  in their visit to him  the day before yesterdayâ  i have formed an opinion as to the state of his mind  not from that alone  but from other circumstances which i had had personal opportunity of seeing q  what is the opinion you have formed as to the state of his mind  a  that it is decidedly that of imbecilityâ  i consider it more imbecility than any thingâ  i do not like giving definitionsâ  in my judgment he is decidedly of unsound mindâ  during the time i have been attending his mother and sister occasionally i have had opportunities of seeing the prisoner  and his mother has frequently mentioned to me that she thought there was something exceedingly peculiar about him  and asked what i thoughtâ  the chief thing that struck me was the laughing  which has been so much dwelt upon  the involuntary kind of laughingâ  with what perhaps we might call a kind of general hysterical tendency in himâ  he did not seem to me to have that sufficient control over the emotions which we generally find in sane individuals q  did you notice  at any time  any other symptom that is usually connected with hysteria  a  my interviews with him were not prolonged  and my attention was attracted to him chiefly by the desire of his mother  who said she was afraid he was getting in the way that his father wasâ  i did not know his fatherâ  i put one or two questions to him  when i saw him in newgateâ  i heard questions put by the other medical men as well  and the answers which he gaveâ  i watched his manner during the interview q  did it appear to you to correspond with his manner on former occasions on which you had seen him  or to differ  a  much the tame characterâ  great insensibility to all the impressions which were attempted to be made upon himâ  on one occasion some time ago my attention was more particularly directed to him  from a circumstance which this occurrence has brought very strongly to my recollection  i think it is about five months since i was on a visit at his mother s house  i called in my rounds to see her  she was very poorly at the time  if i recollect right  he was sitting at the fire reading a book  he took no notice of me when i entered  and seemed to be absorbed in what he was reading  his mother made some observation to him  such as   how rude you are    why not take notice of mr  clarke    why sit there and behave in this kind of way   he did not seem to notice the observation of his mother at all  he seemed still to be absorbed in the book  she put the question to him again  and there was still the same apparent reverie  and when she touched him  to put him in mind that some one was there  he jumped up in a fury  such as at the moment alarmed me  and swore that he would  stick her   i think was the expression he made use of  but certainly it was such an expression that at the moment i drew back  thinking he meditated some violence  after this transaction bad occurred  the mother called on me in great trouble  and made a communication to me  upon which i wished to see the prisoner  accompanying that with some opinion of my own  which i had formed  i did not see the prisoner until the day before yesterday  when the permission of the secretary of state was obtainedâ  i had made application at the home office on the monday q  in cases of hereditary insanity  is there any particular period of life at which medical writers consider it likely to break out  to appear  a  in that kind of insanity particularly  which is connected with acts of violence escoreaux says  in several cases which bear great analogy to the one which we might suppose to exist at presentâ  in six of those cases i think that three of them took place at the age of puberty  between the ages perhaps of fourteen and twenty cross examined bymr  sir frederickk pollock  q  you say you have attended the family for some time  a  yesâ  i live in princes street  leicester squareâ  that is perhaps a mile and a half from where mrs  oxford and the prisoner lived  but they did not live there during the whole time i attended themâ  mrs  oxford has lived in commercial road within the last monthâ  i never prescribed for the prisonerâ  i did not recommend any course of treatmentâ  i considered that the disease was mental  one of those weak minds which  under little excitement  might become overthrownâ  i did not alarm the mother  for she is an exceedingly nervous womanâ  i recommended no course of conduct  diet  or treatment whatever q  in short  i am to understand that you never gave any advice on the subject  of any kind whatever to his mother  a  simply in conversation  i gave my opinion rather as to his state than any advice  nothing furtherâ  i never gave any advice  i was never asked my advice q  where did you meet the medical gentlemen when they went to new gate  a  we came together from dr  chowne s  i think  but i forget at this momentâ  we assembled somewhere  and went togetherâ  i communicated with the medical gentlemen before they saw the prisoner  and stated what my notion was about him  to assist them in their investigationâ  i was present when he was brought into this court last sessions  and heard some affidavits read to postpone the trialâ  i was not asked to make any affidavit at that timeâ  i was subpoenaed here  and was actually in court mr  bodkin  q  was you asked to prescribe for him by his mother  a  no  my visits were to her and to the sisterâ  i am not aware of any medical treatment likely to be useful in cases of hereditary insanityâ  i was told he lived a regular life  no intemperance  no late hoursâ  perhaps twelve o clockâ  his bodily health appeared good not guilty  being insane to be detained during her majesty s pleasure \n",

live with my mother  in a cottage in pocock s fields  islingtonâ  mr  templeman lived in a cottage facing us  on tuesday morning  the 17th of march  i went to mr  templeman s cottage  at half past eight o clock  with two sheets of writing paperâ  i knocked at the door  but received no answerâ  mr  templeman used to sleep in the further room from a cottage inhabited by mrs  jarvis  and the further room from the doorâ  the door opens into one room  and then you go into the otherâ  there is a window to the bed roomâ  when i received no answer i went to the bed room window  and found it shut down as usualâ  there was a short curtain to it insideâ  i was too short to see over the curtainâ  i then went to the sitting room window  and found it openâ  i then returned home  and told my mother what i had observed cross examined bymr  chambers  q  how far is your cottage from mr  templeman s  a  it may be about a yard  as far as i can call to mindâ  it faces itâ  our door is not opposite his doorâ  it is about as far from it as from me to the bench of this courtâ  the window which was open looks towards our cottageâ  there is no yard before itâ  it is all one piece of groundâ  there are palings all round our house  and mr  templeman s tooâ  our bed room window faces towards mr  templeman sâ  i recollect that there was a pane of glass broken for some time in mr  templeman s window  and there was a piece of paper over it  when my mother used to go backwards and forwards  but there was not that morning  it had been thrust throughâ  there are three cottages within about the

at the doorâ  no answer was returnedâ  i then went to the bed room windowâ  it was quite closedâ  there was a curtain and drawn blind to itâ  i looked over the curtain  and saw the bedâ  there was no one in itâ  i saw mr  templeman on the floor  about a yard from the bed  lying with his feet towards the fire place  and his head towards the parlour doorâ  i then went round to the sitting room window  and found it was openâ  i had known mr  templeman nearly four yearsâ  three years and a half full he had been in the neighbourhoodâ  for about two months i had been in the habit of washing and charing for him  fetching his errands  and such likeâ  the parlour window was always closed previous to this morningâ  i never saw it openâ  it used to be fastened with a little button just below where it was brokenâ  it had been broken a long timeâ  it was quite a small hole  nearly close to the buttonâ  there was no difference in the hole that morning  except that the paper was gone  and  i believe  a bit of glassâ  it had been fastened with a bit of glass  and paper on itâ  when the paper was gone any body could put their hand in and open itâ  the window is quite big enough for a man to get in when it is openâ  i had been to the house the evening before  at a quarter before six o clock  and left about five minutes before six o clockâ  he usually went to bed about six o clockâ  he never was up afterwards  unless any body was thereâ  he did not have any beer on monday evening  to my knowledgeâ  i have known the prisoner about four or five monthsâ  he had been pot man at the

prisoner was on visiting terms at jarvis s  and i have seen him go in repeatedlyâ  i think it must be nearly a fortnight before this affair that i saw him thereâ  i did not see any thing of mrs  jarvis on the monday eveningâ  i saw her in the fore part of the day at her own door  or else in the groundâ  she had her child with her q  did you see any money that day at mr  templeman s cottage  a  yes  he showed me some  and told me had been receiving some rentsâ  it was silver  and was in a little mahogany boxâ  i had never seen that box beforeâ  he put it on the table where he took it from

beer  is that quite correct  a  quiteâ  i never said i thought i hadâ  i might have said to  but i can say that i did see him  and that will settle itâ  i might have said i thought  although i was certainâ  the prisoner used to come round to serve the neighbours with beerâ  it was seldom i had any beer  but when i did he served meâ  there are four cottages besides mr  templeman sâ  my son in

labourâ  it was six shillings and two six pencesâ  i received it about a quarter or twenty minutes before six o clock  to the best of my recollectionâ  i know a man named jarvis  and i have seen his wifeâ  i saw her  about half past four o clock that day  come away from her cottage  and go to mr  templeman s cottage  and stand just by the door talking to him  to the best of my recollection  for five or ten minutesâ  i did not see what became of her thenâ  i was busy at workâ  i missed her from the doorâ  i did not take notice which way she went cross examined  q  you were first taken up on

131   on tuesday morning  the 17th of march  about twenty minutes after eleven o clock  i received information  and went to mr  templeman s cottage  in company with two surgeonsâ  i found the door fast insideâ  i went in through the sitting room window  and opened itâ  it was single lockedâ  i unlocked it  and let the  surgeons inâ  it was locked from the inside  and the key was in the doorâ  there are two rooms to the houseâ  there is only one front door  and a door to each roomâ  there is no back doorâ  the two windows are in front of the cottage  one on each side of the doorâ  there is no back window  and no way of gettingout of the house behindâ  you must come either through the door or one of the front windowsâ  there is a wooden partition between the two roomsâ  i saw the body of mr  templeman lying on his back on the floor  not far from the bedâ  his room is smallâ  his feet laid towards the fire place  and his head towards the windowâ  his hands were tied across with a cord in front of himâ  there was one cord round the wrists  and a smaller cord tied round the other cordâ  a stocking was over his eyes  and tied behindâ  there was another stocking on the floorâ  both stockings were covered with bloodâ  i suppose the blood on the one over his eyes came off the floor where he layâ  there was blood on both sides of the stockingâ  sergeant collins came to the cottage soon after  and he found some of the deceased s clothes on a sofaâ  he had nothing on but a shirtâ  i did not observe whether it was a night shirt or day shirtâ  his legs were not tiedâ  there was a chest of drawers in the sitting roomâ  the two top drawers had been forced open  it appeared to me  by a chiselâ  in one of the drawers was a box open  which collins hasâ  i do not know what wood it is made ofâ  i suppose it is mahoganyâ  i should think it is about six inches by ten or elevenâ  there was nothing in itâ  in the bed room mr  roe  the surgeon  picked up a tooth off the pillow  and one off the chair  and i myself picked one up off the floorâ  there was a pool of blood close to the bodyâ  the body lay on the top of the bloodâ  most of the blood was about the headâ  the tooth was in part of the blood close to the headâ  the pillow of the bed was all bloodyâ  the sheets were notâ  the most blood was on the pillow  and the rest on the floor cross examined  q  i wish to know exactly what time it was you went to mr  templeman s cottage  a  about twenty minutes after eleven o clockâ  i went at the request of mr  roe  the surgeonâ  my beat is not in pocock s fieldsâ  it was harris s  no  112  beat that morningâ  he is not hereâ  he went on duty at nine o clock that morning  and would continue there until twoâ  i do not know who he relieved at nineâ  there was a man who left at nineâ  he went on duty at sixâ  the man he relieved would be on duty from nine the night before till six in the morningâ  i do not believe that either of the men who were there that night and morning are hereâ  i know pocock s fieldsâ  there are a great number of cottages thereâ  they are principally inhabited by a working class of peopleâ  mr  templeman s cottage is surrounded by other cottages court  q  then you don t know who the men wereâ  what is their beat  how far does it go  a  it is called the liverpool road beatâ  it belongs to that beatâ  i came on at nine o clock that morning  and was going off at two o clockâ  i was at highburyâ  i do not know how near the policeman in the liverpool road beat would have to go to the place where this happenedâ  i heard him say he passed the cottage about ten o clock  and heard nothing thenâ  i examined the deceased s wristsâ  i did not observe them when the cord was taken offâ  i cannot tell whether the cord was put on after or before he was deadâ  he was bruised about the knees  and on the breastâ  the pillow case was all over bloodâ  it appeared that a blow had been given him while he was lying there  by the tooth being on the pillow mary thorntonre examined  q  to whom did you first give any information concerning the state in which you found the cottage  a  to my son s landlady  a person named pershouse  in the next cottage to ours  about three minutes after i first found it outâ  my son returned from thetheatre about ten or twenty minutes after nine o clock in the morningâ  i had heard mr  templeman mention that he had a grandson living in mortimer street  and i knew him wellâ  as soon as my son came home from the theatre  i sent him to give information to mr  templemanâ  that was in consequence of what the deceased had told me during his life time cross examined  q  did you see mr  templeman s body through the window  a  i didâ  i said so to mrs  pershouseâ  she did not accompany me to the window  and i told the baker  who came up with mr  templeman s breadâ  i do not know the policeman who was on duty at the timeâ  i never saw himâ  i have seen policemen there  but do not know who was there that morningâ  they very seldom came thereâ  i did not attempt to find one edward roe  i am a surgeon  and live in brown buildings  islington  i accompanied mr  lord and a policeman to mr  templeman s cottage  about twenty minutes after eleven o clockâ  the policeman got through the window  opened the door  and let us inâ  i saw the deceased with only a shirt on  lying with his feet towards the fire place  and his head towards the door of the roomâ  the body was in the bed room  towards the door  which is between the two roomsâ  he was lying on his back  rather inclining to the left side  lacing the windowâ  his eyes were firmly bandaged with a stockingâ  if he had been alive  he could not have seenâ  there was a good deal of blood on the stocking  which i think must have been saturated with the blood on the floor  after it was tied on his eyesâ  i have no doubt his head had fallen on the floor  and the stocking got into the bloodâ  his hands were securely tied by a cord in this postureâ   describing it â  a small cord secured the other cord fastened between the wrists  through a noose in the cord  to make it more secureâ  i did not notice the wrists thenâ  i did after the cord was removed  and they were galled  and the hands and nails blueâ  that would unquestionably show that it had been put on during lifeâ  i have no doubt he struggledâ  the blueness would be occasioned by the pressure of the cordâ  i observed several bruises on his face  a severe blow over the left temple  and a cut on the noseâ  the lower jaw was fractured on both sidesâ  i observed four clean cuts on the back of the head  and one or two bruises on the breast bone  in conjunction with the collar boneâ  his knees were much abraised  rubbed up  as he had  no doubt  been struggling on the floorâ  there was some blood on the floor immediately under the deceased s headâ  i should say perhaps ten ouncesâ  the wounds would most likely continue to bleed some timeâ  there was no contused wound on the left temple to cause the bloodâ  i have no doubt a good deal of the blood came from the jaw  and also the clean cuts on the back of the headâ  the blow on the temple was most probably given by a blunt round instrument  similar to a policeman s staffâ  it might be done by a piece of woodâ  the same instrument might have produced the fracture of the jaw  and one blow might produce both fracturesâ  i think the wound on the nose was from a kick  or something of that description  not done by a sharp instrumentâ  the wounds on the back of the head were inflicted by a very sharp instrument court  q  were they inflicted as with a knife  as if a person had cut  or a hatchet  as if they had struck  a  neitherâ  i should say like a chisel  as if a chisel had been struck on the back of the head mr  jones  q  did you find any teeth  a  i found one on the pillow  with a great deal of blood round it  and another on a chair  with a few spots of bloodâ  i was present when a third was found by the policemanâ  i examined the jaw  and found three teeth had been forced from the socketsâ  they were not front  but tide teethâ  i think that was very probably done by the blow which produced the fracturesâ  there were several blows about the mouth  and i think one while he was lying in bed  from the circumstance of the tooth being found on the pillow  and the blood thereâ  the tooth on the chair was as if it had fallen out when he got out of bedâ  i found a small piece of stick  about two inches and a half or three inches long  with hair attached to it  and saturated with bloodâ  it was the hair of the headâ  it was dark hairâ  i can scarcely call it greyâ  this is the piece of splinterâ   produced â  there is hair on it nowâ  a kick from the heel or toe of a shoe might have made the cut on the nose  if there were nails in it  and i think it might be done by a shoe or boot without nailsâ  from the appearance of the body when i saw it  i should judge it had been dead fire or six hoursâ  it retained a little warmth about the region of the heartâ  the body was quite coldâ  the time in which a body gets cold depends occasionally on the kind of death the person meets withâ  a body has retained warmth occasionally two days after deathâ  ten or eleven hours is not at all an unusual timeâ  i have no doubt  had the body remained in bed  it would have been warm a long time after it wasâ  mr  lord accompanied meâ  he was also present at the post mortem examinationâ  the injuries which i saw on the body  produced deathâ  i have no doubt the death was owing to the violence i have described court  q  how was the stocking fastened round the head  a  it was tied in a knot twiceâ  the knot was formed in the stocking itselfâ  the blow on the temple was above the stocking  over the temple cross examined  q  is it your judgment  as a man of experience  that the body had been dead about five or six hours  a  it isâ  i should rather say a body would be more likely to retain heat two days where the party came to his death by violent meansâ  a body would of course be more likely to get cold on the floor than in bedâ  it was a very cold night on monday  and morning tooâ  i should think there was not sixteen ounces of blood altogether on the pillow and floor q  i believe the piece of stick is mahogany  a  i am no judgeâ  it is saturated with blood  and the character of the wood is alteredâ  it is splintered off a round stickâ  there is no doubt of it mr  jones  q  in your judgment  would the blows you saw on the deceased occasion instant death  a  i believe the blow over the left temple would occasion instant deathâ  i did not observe whether there was any matting or carpet on the floorâ  he might have been dead more than five or six hoursâ  it is mere matter of opinionâ  saw nothing to render it improbable that he had been dead a longer time court  q  it may have been fifteen  ten  or five or six  but it must have been five or six  that is what you mean  a  yes  it could not have been less than five or sixâ  i do not know whether it might have been fifteen  it is a very difficult question to answerâ  i should rather not pledge myself to a few hours  more or less alfred lord  i am a surgeon  and live in trinidad place  islington  i was present at mr  templeman s cottage with mr  roe  and saw the state in which the body wasâ  i attended the post mortem examinationâ  in my judgment he died of the wounds i sawâ  the blow on the left temple would alone be sufficient to produce deathâ  it produced concussion of the brain  and extravasation of bloodâ  he would not be able to stir after that the same blow producing a fracture of the skull  he could not struggle afterwardsâ  the struggling with the arms and knees must have been beforeâ  after the blow which fractured the jaw there might have been a good deal of struggling court  q  did the deceased appear to be an athletic strong man  a  he appeared to have been so at one period of life  and from my observation of his body he was rather a stout manâ  he appeared rather a strongish man  and one who would struggle a good deal  i thinkâ  the hands were blue below the cordâ  the hands and nailsâ  i do not think one man could have tied his hands unless another held them john collins  police sergeant   i went to mr  templeman s cottage on  tuesday morning  and was there with the surgeonsâ  i have produced the splinter of woodâ  it was cut at the police officeâ  i have had it examined  according to the prisoner s request  by a turner  who gave his opinion that it is  red saunders â  he described it as a very heavy close wood  coming from new south walesâ  i searched the drawers in the deceased s sitting roomâ  the top drawer on the left hand side had been broken open apparently by a chisel or small crow bar or somethingâ  i found in it two boxes  a quantity of papers  and two notes of the bank of eleganceâ  one for 50l  and the other for 5l â   producing them â  this is the mahogany boxâ  it has a lock to itâ  it is not brokenâ  it was shut when i found it  but unlockedâ  i found the key of it in the deceased s trowsers pocketâ  i do not think any violence had been offered to the lockâ  there are also a quantity of papers  bills  and memorandumsâ  i found no money in the drawers  but in his trowsers pocket was a purse with three sixpencesâ  that was in the same pocket with the keyâ  the papers were apparently tumbled about a good dealâ  these notes  folded up in this way look like notes of the bank of englandâ  i thought they were so when i first found themâ  behind the door of the sitting room i found a chopper and a hammer in the corner between the outer door and the bed room doorâ  i do not think they had been usedâ  i also found a hammer in the cupboard on the top of some clothesâ  that did not appear to have been usedâ  i found no piece of wood except thisâ  i found no weight except two clock weightsâ  they were round at the bottom and flat at the topâ  they were in the further corner of the sitting room  attached to the clockâ  i did not find any other weights in the bed room cross examined  q  how many persons have you taken up on this charge  a  there have been four persons  jarvis and his wife  ciprani  and the prisonerâ  pocock s fields is included in my dutyâ  i was on duty on the monday nightâ  i did not visit pocock s fieldsâ  thomas peacock is the man who was on duty thereâ  he is not hereâ  harris came on duty at nine o clockâ  i do not know who went on duty between six and nine o clockâ  i know pocock s fieldsâ  i should think mr  templeman s cottage is a mile  or nearly so  from the angel  at islington mr  ballantine  q  how far is it from the rainbow public house  a  about a quarter of a mile jane lovett  i am the wife of jonathan lovett  and keep an eating house at no  2  northern buildings  somer s town  we occupied the house as tenant to mr  templemanâ  on monday the 16th of march mr  templeman called on me at a quarter before twelve o clockâ  i had known him about three yearsâ  he appeared generally poorly in the winter  he had better health in the summerâ  he appeared rather poorly that dayâ  he had acold  i imagineâ  i paid him 3l  that morningâ  it consisted of five or six half crownsâ  i am positive there were five  and one half sovereign  the rest in shillings  and to the best of my knowledge six sixpences cross examined  q  do you know where you got that money  a  i took it in business at different timesâ  i took the whole of it within two days in our shop hannah morgan  i live at no  18  skinner street  somer s townâ  i knew the deceasedâ  he called on me on the 16th of march at half past eleven o clock in the morning  and asked me to lend him 3l   which i didâ  i gave him fourteen half crowns and twenty five shillingsâ  he gave me 1s  for apiece of mutton to carry home to make him some soupâ  he dined with us  and left at half past three o clockâ  he seemed in very low spirits and bad health  labouring under a very bad cold court  q  did he give you any reason why he borrowed the money  a  he said he wanted it to make up an account of moneyâ  he left at a quarter before twelve o clock  and came in again and dined with us afterwards mr  jones  q  did he ask you to lend him the 3l  before he went away  or afterwards  a  he asked for it as soon as he returned to dine  which was about a quarter before twelve  or from that to twelveâ  i do not live near himâ  he left at half past three o clock in the afternoonâ  skinner street leads into the new road  nearly opposite judd streetâ  i cannot tell how far that is from pocock s fieldsâ  i never was there  only at the barnsbury castle public houseâ  i suppose it is two miles from thereâ  i know mrs  lovettâ  she lives about three doors from meâ  he gave me the shilling after he asked for the 3l jane lovettre examined  i did not observe whether he had any other money about him when i paid him the 3l  for the rent cross examined  q  where did he put it  a  in his right hand trowsers pocket john bush  i am a labourer  and live in goodwin street  barnsbury park  i had a cottage in pocock s fields  called spring cottageâ  about seven months ago the deceased offered me 25l  for itâ  he never brought any money forwardâ  we did not come to any agreement at that timeâ  i saw him about a week or nine days afterâ  there was an agreement between my wife and himâ  he said he would give me 25l  if i would take itâ  i said it was no use  i wanted 30l â  we only had one conversation on the subjectâ  it was against his own gateâ  i stood outside and he insideâ  i mentioned to several people about what had taken place between mr  templeman and myself about the cottage court  q  this conversation took place between you and him alone  a  yes cross examined  q  how far from mr  templeman s cottage do you live  a  i suppose two hundred yards benjamin hawkins  i keep a beer shop in bride street  islington  not far from mr  templeman s cottageâ  i knew himâ  i do not remember any communication between bush and mr  templeman about a cottageâ  i saw a sum of money with mr  templeman at the time he was about to buy a cottageâ  i do not know how much it wasâ  it is as much as three or four months ago cross examined  q  do you know john bush  a  yesâ  that is not the circumstance i refer to court  q  then this money had no reference to bush s cottage  a  no  it was for mr  game s cottage mr  ballantine  q  do you know jarvis s cottage  a  yesâ  i knew mrs  jarvis and the prisonerâ  i saw him at mrs  jarvis s once  sitting by the fireâ  i do not know whether he was smokingâ  it it two or three months ago cross examined  q  do you happen to know a man named henry wright  a  yesâ  i believe he is a pot manâ  he lodged at allen s at the same time as gould lodged thereâ  that is a good while ago  i should think about last christmasâ  wright was out of employ thenâ  i do not know where he is pot manâ  when i first knew him he was at mr  stroud s  at the king s arm s public house  liverpool roadâ  that is twelve months ago  i believeâ  it is about a quarter of a mile from pocock s fieldsâ  he was pot man thereâ  i think it was after that that he went to lodge at allen sâ  i cannot recollect distinctly the time he lodged thereâ  i am not sure whether it was before christmas or afterâ  i do not know how long he lived thereâ  he very seldom frequented my beer shop  he did once now and then to take a glass of porterâ  i do not know any other place besides stroud s where he livedâ  he was a good bit out of employ  i know  but how long i could not positively tellâ  i have not seen him about pocock s fields lately with beerâ  i did at the time he lived at stroud sâ  he was not living there at the time i heard this about the money  it was before thatâ  i do not know whether he was living at allen s at that timeâ  i cannot say mr  jones  q  you say wright and the prisoner lodged together at allen s  a  yesâ  i do not know whether they were intimate friendsâ  i do not recollect that i ever saw them together away from allen s joseph mustow  i live at a cottage at the back of mr  temple man s  close to hisâ  i do not know the prisoner  but i have seen him about with beer from the barnsbury castle public house where he was pot manâ  i cannot say how long it is since he left thereâ  i know i took beer of him before christmas  but i do not think i have sinceâ  i do not know whether he supplied mr  templeman with beerâ  i have seen him about the cottages supplying people with beerâ  i knew mr  templeman very wellâ  i have heard that he was in the habit of talking to people about his money  and he has showed it to me several timesâ  he has paid me small sums of moneyâ  he generally took it out of his pocketâ  he took out more than he wantedâ  he appeared fond of showing his moneyâ  on the tuesday before he was murdered he showed me this 50l  noteâ  it was doubled up so that i could just see the amount at the cornerâ  it was in his roomâ  he went to the drawer and fetched it out to show it meâ  i did not mention the circumstance to any body till after his deathâ  i have seen the prisoner at mrs  jarvis s  when he lived at the barnsbury castle public houseâ  i cannot say that i have seen him there since  or in the neighbourhoodâ  i have two dogsâ  i keep one at the end of my house where i keep my pigsâ  that is just at the back of mr  templeman a cottageâ  it is always out at night chained upâ  he is a sort of lurcherâ  any body he knows may do any thing with him  but to strangers he is not so civilâ  i kept that dog there while the prisoner was at the barnsbury castleâ  the prisoner was not acquainted with the dogâ  i do not think he knew himâ  he might have seen him  but not to be near himâ  i do not think the prisoner was ever on my premises cross examined  q  when were you subpoenaed to attend here  a  last nightâ  that was the first time i was applied to court  q  did your dog make any noise on the night of the 16th  a  noâ  the dog was about as far from the window at which the persons got into the house  as across this court  or half as far againâ  i am sure the dog would begin to bark at a stranger at that distance  if he could hear his footsteps  but it would be ten to one if the dog heard them  because that window is in front  and the dog was behind henry wright  i am potman at the duchess of kent public house  devereux street  dover road  where i have been seven weeksâ  it is about four miles from mr  templeman s cottageâ  i have known the prisoner from seven to eight monthsâ  i saw him on the 12th or 13th of last march  i am not positive whichâ  i think it was the 12th  thursdayâ  he came to the duchess of kent public house about half past seven o clock in the evening  and called fur half a pint of porter  and put down a penny  saying he had no more moneyâ  i did not take the moneyâ  i brought him a pint of porterâ  i then went out to deliver my beerâ  i returned about half past eight o clockâ  the prisoner was then standing on the outside  opposite the house  talking to a young man  a potman in the neighbourhood  named richard squiresâ  there was no conversation between them after i came upâ  we had some porter togetherâ  as soon as we had had the pot of porter between us three  the prisoner and i walked up the street togetherâ  while we were walking together he said he had been ill  and was without money  and for want of money he was getting worseâ  he stated that he knew an old man who had got moneyâ  i asked him how he knew he had got moneyâ  he said he had heard he had bid 25l  for a cottage  and he had flashed a 50l  note  and said if that was not enough he had got moreâ  the prisoner said that he had put the notes into a drawer  and it would be like a gift to him  for he knew where to put his hand on itâ  he said he should like to have a right one along with himâ  i said   a right one  â  he said   yes  a right one  or i could do it myself â  i asked him where the old gentleman livedâ  he said   oh  not far  q  not far from when  a  from where gould lived court  q  did he say so  a  yes  he said  not far from him  that it  signifying where gould livedâ  he said   not far from home â  those were the words be used mr  ballantine  q  now  is that all you remember of what passed  or was any thing else said  a  that is all i rememberâ  when he was in the tap room he named to me that he had been to a publican whom he once lived with  and that he should endeavour to get a situation  and try that man if he would give him a character  that he would send to himâ  that was before i walked with himâ  he said nothing further than i have stated with reference to the old gentleman s money cross examined  q  do you know where mr  templeman lived  a  yes  in pocock s fields  at the back of liverpool terraceâ  a sawyer lived in the next cottage to mr  templeman s when i served himâ  i do not know who lives in it nowâ  i think the sawyer s name was william izodâ  he worked in the city roadâ  i served himâ  i served most of them near mr  templeman s cottage  all round the fieldâ  i served the principal of the cottagesâ  i think there were not ten persons who did not deal with me when i carried beer round thereâ  nobody lived with mr  templeman thenâ  i do not know who took care of his houseâ  this cottage was buildingat the time  and after izod left  he lived in this cottage till his cottage was builtâ  mr  tiffin was building this cottage for him while he lived in izod sâ  he took possession of the new cottage about two years backâ  i have known him as long as thatâ  that is the only cottage into which he shiftedâ  when i first knew him i was living at mr  ralph s  the william the fourth public house  at the corner of park street and minerva placeâ  i left there because i got another situationâ  i did not like itâ  there was no other reason for my leavingâ  i went after that to the craven arms public house  bayswaterâ  i was about twenty six weeks at mr  ralph s the first timeâ  i did not go with a character to the other placeâ  i was eleven months at the craven arms public houseâ  after leaving there i went to work for mr  ralph a week  till he got a man  and then i went to the hope and anchor public house  islingtonâ  the landlord left the house  and mr  walton took it  and there were a few words between us  and i leftâ  there was no charge against meâ  the words were about stopping out a few hoursâ  i stopped out between four and eight o clockâ  i went away of my own accordâ  the words were with mr  walton  who keeps the houseâ  there had been no charge against me of any kindâ  there has been a charge  but it was not from mr  waltonâ  it was from the duke of york public house  gloucester streetâ  i asked permission to go out  while i was out  a cash box was lost  and when i returned home i was taken up on suspicion  and charged with stealing itâ  that might be between four and five years agoâ  there has been nothing furtherâ  i never was in custody before  nor yet charged with any thingâ  i lived at the city of london public houseâ  i was not in custody respecting any thing thereâ  it it at the corner of sydney street and dalby terraceâ  i left there to take a beer shop  after nine years  serviceâ  i left of my own accordâ  there was a cellar thereâ  nothing was said about my conduct in that cellarâ  that i swearâ  that is somewhere about the time after i came out of hatton garden officeâ  i went to live there againâ  i lived there about ten monthsâ  i opened the beer shop before i went to the duke of york public house  but it did not succeedâ  i know mr  jarvis s cottage very well q  how long before the night mr  templeman lost his life  were you in pocock s fields do you think  a  on the 9th or 10th i was thereâ  i went to visit mr  allen of wilson cottageâ  i had lodged there some time beforeâ  there are two rooms in allen s cottage and  an old back kitchen  and a wash house adjoining itâ  there is about half an acre of gardenâ  the privy is in the wash house  adjoining the bed roomâ  you can go from the parlour into the little  kitchen into it  and you can go into the garden to get to it q  you mentioned something about what the prisoner said about a drawer  do you mean to say he said that  a  yesâ  i recollected that in my statement at the time i was at hatton garden at my last evidenceâ  i think i recollected it at the time i was at hatton gardenâ  i am certain i didâ  i have been twice to hatton gardenâ  the first time was on a saturdayâ  the saturday after mr  templeman s body had been found on the tuesdayâ  i did not recollect it when i first wentâ  i do not know any thing of this little mahogany boxâ  i am not positive that i ever heard of a mahogany boxâ  i think  but i have never mentioned it  because i was not positive of hearing of itâ  i can readâ  i have read an account of this in the newspapersâ  i read the newspapers between my first and secondexaminationâ  i did not read any account of where the money was kept q  on your oath  did you not read in the newspapers where the money was placed  a  i have read the papers  but i speak from the words gould named to me  that the money was in the drawerâ  i have no recollection of reading in the papers where the money was placed court  q  what did you read the newspapers for  was it to refresh your memory  a  no mr  chambers  q  was it a sunday paper you read  a  i have read the  dispatch  once  but not the whole of itâ  i think i read it the sunday after my first examinationâ  i do not know that i didâ  i am not certain that it was the sunday after  because in our business i catch hold of a paper  and lay it down againâ  i did not read the whole account of the evidenceâ  i had not the opportunity of doing soâ  i might read part of itâ  i recollected about the drawer after i had been to hatton garden on the saturday court  q  had you mentioned about the drawer till you read the  dispatch   a  no mr  chambers  q  how old are you  a  twenty sevenâ  the last time i lodged at allen s is about seven weeks backâ  i left allen s to go to the situation i am now inâ  i was lodging there last christmas  and gould lodged in the same houseâ  he did not lodge there at christmasâ  he was at placeâ  he had been at place a week or two  at mr  bartlett s  the barnsbury castle public houseâ  i was living there alone at christmasâ  i knew mr  templeman s cottage  and the window  but never took particular notice of itâ  i cannot say whether it was a whole window  or whether there was any thing the matter with it q  were you aware that in the conversation you say took place a robbery was intended  a  yesâ  i understood his intent was to commit a robberyâ  it was mentioned only in my bearingâ  i did not suppose any violence was to be done to the old gentlemanâ  i understood him to mean by  a right one   somebody to assist him  that he could depend uponâ  i understood there was to be a robbery only q  were you shocked at it  a  why  i took very little notice of itâ  i named it to squires when i went round at nine o clock  and said i did not know whether it was intended or notâ  squires lives at the two brewers public house  the next houseâ  i did not name it to any policemanâ  squires said he did not think if he had any intention he would have named itâ  squires is not here q  did you think it was a joke  a  i did not think he was jokingâ  i took no notice of what he said  till i named it to squires at nine o clock  and neither of us took notice of itâ  it never entered my mind till i readâ  till i heard of the murder  q  why name it to squires if you thought nothing about it  and if you did think any thing about it why did you not name it to a policeman  a  i named it to squires  and it did not enter my mind afterwards till squires told me he had read in the paper of a murder  and i read of it when i got homeâ  i first heard of it on the wednesdayâ  squires had read the paper  and named it to meâ  i do not know james rogers mr  ballantine  q  you have been asked about a cash boxâ  had some charge been made against you about it  a  yesâ  only suspicionâ  i think i was in custody a weekâ  i was afterwards discharged by the magistrateâ  i did not come to trial upon itâ  except on that occasion i have never been in custody in my life  and i never bad any charge of dishonesty theft of any kind made against me q  did you give evidence in this case of your own accord  or were you called on to do so  a  i had not time to come overâ  i sent word over to mr  allen on the wednesday  about an hour after squires made the communication to meâ  i went before the magistrate on the saturdayâ  one of the officers called on meâ  that was after i had made the communication to allenâ  i stated at the office all of the circumstances as near as i could recollectâ  i never had any quarrel with the prisonerâ  i had always been on friendly terms with himâ  squires is living at this place nowâ   a messenger was here sent to fetch squires  john richard johnson  i live at no  7  dotset street  spitalfields  and am a print colourerâ  i colour caricatures  and principally religious printsâ  that is the way in which i get my livingâ  i have known the prisoner between four and five yearsâ  i saw him on friday evening the 13th of marchâ  i left off work about half past seven o clock that evening  and when i came down stairs there was a person in the passage inquiring for jemâ  i did not see himâ  i heard him  and when i came down in the passage the woman below said jem was not at home  and then i saw the prisoner  arthur nicholson â  that was the name he gave meâ   a private in the 11th light dragoons  canterbury â  the prisoner was present when i wrote this paper i have in my handâ  that if ever he should be tried as a deserter  i might know his right nameâ  he gave me this  as near as possible  twelve months ago last decemberâ  he desired me to write down his name that i might know if he was ever tried as a deserter  he was the manâ  it is my handwritingâ  he saw me write itâ  i put it into the drawer  and there it remained till this occurrence took placeâ  when i saw him in the passage  i said   dick  how do you get on  â  he said he wanted to see jemâ  i asked him what he wanted to see jem forâ  he said he wanted to see him  for he wanted to borrow a screwâ  i asked him what forâ  he said he was going to serve an old gentleman in a lonely cottageâ  i told him he had better not do any thing of the kind  if he did he would be sure to get transportedâ  he told me he might as well be transported for that  for if he was takes as a deserter  he was sure to be transportedâ  at the end of that conversation  a fight took place at the bottom of our street  and i and the prisoner went down together to see itâ  seven or eight rounds were foughtâ  the police came up to disperse the mob  and i and the prisoner returned back again about as far as our door  and i wished him good nightâ  he said   you had better not go yet  for i want to see jem very particularly â  i asked him what he wanted to see jem so very particularly forâ  he said he wanted a darkey  that he had left there some time ago  and it might be handyâ  i told him if he wanted to see jem so very particularly  he had better go over the way to the public houseâ  he said he could not go over the way  for he had no moneyâ  he further stated  that if he served the old gentleman  as was his intention on the saturday  he was going over the water to see his aunt or cousin  and would give me a call on sunday  and let me know q  let you know what  a  whether he had robbed the old gentleman  i supposeâ  that is the inference i drew from what he saidâ  he did not say he would rob himâ  he said he would call on sunday and let me know q  you have said he spoke about a screw and a darkey  what is meantby a screw  a  i cannot tell  only from what i have been in the habit of readingâ  i have read  bell s life in london â  i know what screw means according to the defamation i have heard in the bookâ  according to the defamation i have read in  bell s life in london   it means a picklock keyâ  i bid the prisoner good night  and we partedâ  i saw no more of himâ  i afterwards saw an account of the murder at islington in the newspaper  and the day after i gave information to a policeman of the h divisionâ  that division is in the neighbourhood of spitalfieldsâ  i then stated what i have to day  i believe  word for wordâ  i was examined before the magistrate  after recognising the prisonerâ  i was taken by a policeman to be sure of himâ  waddingtoo the jailer said   you are to recognise the prisoner â  i believe i said  yes   and i pointed to him  and said   that is the man  cross examined  q  how long have you known gould  a  between four and five yearsâ  that was as near as possible my first acquaintance with himâ  i only knew him then as dick or richard  nothing furtherâ  that was at mr  webber s  at the public house at the corner of our streetâ  i never inquired his other nameâ  i should say i knew him three years as dick q  where was be living when he got you to write this card  a  why  i gave him a lodging  to tell you the truth  at now 7  dorset streetâ  i have not known him up to the present timeâ  he has been absent some timeâ  i have not seen him but once previous to the friday  for eight or nine weeksâ  that was at the weaver s arms public houseâ  jem is a party who had moved in below meâ  his name is james rogersâ  he had moved in very likely two monthsâ  it is not my houseâ  i am only the tenant of one apartmentâ  i have known rogers  i should say  fourteen or fifteen yearsâ  it was not by my introduction that he came into the room belowâ  if i had had the letting of the house  i would not have let him in at all q  you knew him too well  a  no  i never knew any dishonest action of the manâ  he is a labouring manâ  he has only a small apartment at 1s  3d  a weekâ  he gets his living among the wharfs  on board the barges  to carry flour or corn  or any thing on shore if barges come up  and if they wanted any body to unload them  they would as life employ him as any bodyâ  he may have regular masters for any thing i knowâ  i do not know that he has q  what has he been during the fourteen or fifteen years you have known him  a  he got his living by going about buying and repairing old umbrellas  portering  or any thing like thatâ  i do not know whether he comes in at good hours at nightâ  he never lived in the same house as me beforeâ  i had no objection to having him in the same house  but i have not the letting of the house q  why should you object to let him the house if you had the letting of it  a  because he is a man so often out of work  and could not afford to pay his rentâ  i have been in business about twenty four or twenty five years  not always colouring religious prints  but latterly i have done themâ  i have done some thousands of prints for mr  fairburn  no  110  minories  principally religious printsâ  i have occasionally done maps  plans  and chartsâ  that is the only trade i have been inâ  i never kept a shopâ  i have been eleven years in my present lodgingâ  i have a wife and family living with meâ  i have three children out of eightâ  they live as well as they can since my work has been stoppedâ  my work has been stopped since this fatal occurrenceâ  i have had one little job since q  why could you not colour prints notwithstanding this  a  on account of my giving evidenceâ  it got into the newspapers  and my master stopped the workâ  i suspect soâ  i do not buy and sell things at allâ  i never did to my knowledgeâ  i bought this coat the other day  and i might sell it to morrowâ  i bought every thing i have got on court  q  do not answer in that foolish wayâ  did you ever buy and sell to make profit  a  never mr  chambers  q  you never bought anything  a  no  it was never said that i didâ  i was never charged with buying any thingâ  i was never in any scrape about a robbery  i am certainâ  i will tell you  the prisoner and i were together at a public house  a man charged me with robbing him of a shilling  and the prisoner went with me to the station house  and offered the man 5s  to let me outâ  i was not let outâ  the man came between one and two o clock in the morning  said he had found the shilling  and wanted the man to discharge me  but he said he could not  as the charge for felony was signedâ  the man never appeared afterwardsâ  it happened at the bluecoat boy public house  in dorset street  within a door or two of my own houseâ  the man was a butcherâ  i have known him in the neighbourhood for yearsâ  that is not quite two years ago  i thinkâ  i was once locked up for being drunk and disorderlyâ  i have never been in any difficulty about other people s property  except about the shilling q  when the prisoner said he was going to commit a robbery  did you endeavour to persuade him not to do so  a  i said if he did he would be sure to be transportedâ  i did not endeavour to persuade him not to do itâ  i did not believe himâ  i understood what he meant by a screw  by reading  tom and jerry  and  bell s life â  i have seen that expression in  tom and jerry  many timesâ  i have borrowed the book once or twice q  if you thought he really meant nothing  how came you to tell him he would be transported if he did it  a  why he would if he did it q  i thought you considered he was in fun  a  i did not think he was in much funâ  i did not think he was in earnestâ  he has laughed and joked with me many times before q  did you really think him in fun or earnest  a  i should firmly believe now that he did mean it  but i did not believe he meant it at the momentâ  i should sooner say he was in joke than in earnest q  why persuade him not to do it  then  and tell him he would be transported  a  i said if he did it he would be transported q  now  while you were pausing to give me an answer  did not you hear what that gentleman  mr  ballantine  saidâ  did you not give me your answer after hearing what that gentleman said  a  i did not hear what he said  i did not hear him speakâ  i could see his lips go  that is allâ  i did not shake hands with the prisoner when i parted with himâ  i have shook hands with him many timesâ  i did not see jem that night  nor tell him he was wantedâ  i left the prisoner at the door when i bid him good nightâ  i did not go up to my own roomâ  i came back between eleven and twelve o clock  i believeâ  i do not know whether jem was at homeâ  i did not see jem at all before i read any thing in the newspapersâ  he was in the back room  i supposeâ  we have to go down the cellar into the yard  and there is the back room thereâ  i saw jem once before i read the newspaperâ  i think he came home as usual mr  jones  q  had you any other reason for not liking to have jem in the house except his poverty  a  that is allâ  i have never been in custody except on the occasion i have mentioned q  you have been asked whether you believed the prisoner was serious when he said he was going to commit a robbery  did you believe it at the time  a  so many jokes have passed between me and him  i did not know how to take itâ  i believe it now  from what has happened court  q  what time was it he came to you  a  about twenty minutes to eight o clock  as near as possibleâ  at half past seven o clock i sent my wife home with three hundred printsâ  i had just got my coat and shoes on and came down  and judge it to be that timeâ  he was with me altogether about a quarter of an hourâ  he left me before eight o clockâ  as i passed the station house to go into church street  the bells struck out eight  that was the moment i had parted with himâ  i did not see jem during all the time i was with him james rogers  i live at no  7  dorset street  spitalfieldsâ  i am an umbrella maker by trade  but i do not follow itâ  i work at the water side as a labourerâ  i have known the prisoner about five years  or it may be six  by the name of richard or dickâ  on the 13th of march was the last time i saw him  barring seeing him at hatton gardenâ  i saw him at my door  where i live  when i was going home between eight and nine o clock in the evening court  q  between eight and nine o clock  a  yesâ  i believe i once said a quarter before eight o clockâ  i now say it was between eight and nine mr  ballantine  q  where were you standing  a  i was coming home  and he was standing by the window as i was coming  just between the window and the doorâ  the first observation he made to me was   jem  you are just the chap i want to see â  i said   what do you want to see me for  â  he said   i want for you to lend me two screws and a darkey â  i should say he meant skeleton keys and a dark lanternâ  i said he might as well ask me for a â 500 note as to ask me for such things as themâ  nothing else was said on that subjectâ  i said i had no money for beer or else i would treat him  and he said he had noneâ  my brother in law was along with meâ  he had not been with me all the timeâ  he came up along with me when i came to the door  but i don t think he heard any thing of what he said  but i cannot say whether he did or notâ  i said to my brother in law   bill  you stand a pot of beer â  he said   i have not got any money without going home to fetch it  but go over to the public house  call for a pot of beer  and i will come and pay for it â  we went to the blue coat boy public house in dorset street  and had a pot of beer  my brother in law paid for itâ  i once kept an old iron shopâ  that was while i was acquainted with the prisoner  and he knew it cross examined  q  where was it you kept the old iron shop  a  in little paternoster rowâ  i did not keep the houseâ  i had the lower part nine or ten months  then necessity compelled me to leave itâ  i sold locks and any thing in that wayâ  i bought and sold old iron  and sometimes bottles and rags  not any thing that came to hand  because there might be things that came in a different sort of wayâ  i was very careful of what i boughtâ  i used to go and collect thingsâ  i mostly bought in petticoat laneâ  i have never been in any scrape arising from the old iron shop  not at allâ  i was never taken upâ  if i were to say i never was in any prison  i should say falseâ  when i was a boy i got a month for sleeping out in the open airâ  that is seventeen or eighteen years agoâ  i was in no business thenâ  i was sent to coldbath fields for a monthâ  i cannot recollect any thing elseâ  i became acquainted with the expressions darkey and screws by reading  bell s life  newspaperâ  i don t know whether johnson reads itâ  i am sure i have seen those expressions in  bell s life â  i never read it in  tom and jerry â  i do not know that i ever took up that paperâ  i have known johnson  i suppose  about ten yearsâ  he lodges in the same house as me  with his wifeâ  he has got three or four children i believeâ  i very seldom go up into his roomâ  i believe he was a print colourer when i first knew himâ  i may have been up in his room two or three times q  how long before gould visited you had you seen johnson  a  i suppose not for a monthâ  i go in and out of the placeâ  i live down stairsâ  i have not lodged there altogether  i believe  above four monthsâ  i have seen johnson out of the house  but not above once in the house to my knowledgeâ  my brother in law s name is william craneâ  i found the prisoner standing between the window and the doorâ  crane was with meâ  he went home to get the money  returned and paid for the beer  and then retired to look after a sweetheart of hisâ  he was standing within a yard or two till he went away to get the moneyâ  the prisoner did not whisperâ  he spoke loud enoughâ  crane might or might not hear itâ  i cannot sayâ  i dare say he mightâ  i had no notion what the darkey and screws were wanted forâ  i never gave it a thoughtâ  there had been no darkey left with meâ  i did not see johnson at all that nightâ  i do not think i saw him at all after  till i had been up to hatton gardenâ  i am not positive of itâ  he and i had no conversationâ  i never kept such things as skeleton keys when i was in the iron tradeâ  nothing of the kind  nor darkeysâ  when i first knew the prisoner he was pot boy at a house at the bottom of the street q  did you think there was any thing wrong in asking for these  a  i did not give it a thought whether there was any thing wrong or rightâ  i did not trouble my head about itâ  i passed it by as a jokeâ  i get my bread by the water side when i am in employâ  i do not work for any body in the umbrella businessâ  i work for myself  but i am an occasional man in the other jobâ  i had a job on saturdayâ  i sometimes go out very soon in the morning  and work from eight or ten o clock in the evening till twelve o clock  when we are landing ale  and such thingsâ  i was examined at the police office mr  ballantine  q  were you compelled to go before the magistrate  or did you give evidence voluntarily  a  i saw it in the paper  and i went up to hatton garden the same day  but there was no court thenâ  it was not the same day i saw the account of the murder  but the same day i saw my name in the paperâ  that was on monday  and i went up the same day  but the examination was not onâ  it took place the next day  and i attended and gave evidenceâ  i stated all i knewâ  i have been on friendly terms with the prisoner  but i have not seen him above twice for two years court  q  when you went to be examined you knew johnson had been examined  a  i was told he had been the week previous  but i did not see johnson till after i had been examinedâ  i think i saw his examination in the newspaper before i was examined  but i will not be positive richard squires  i am waiter at the two brewers public house  george street  horsemonger lane  and have been so four years  i knowthe prisoner  but no more than by seeing him three times in my lifeâ  i saw him last  i think  on the 17th of marchâ  he came over the water to see wrightâ  it was on the thursday evening  to the best of my recollectionâ  i cannot swear whether it was thursday or fridayâ  it was about half past eight o clock in the evening  or it might be nine o clockâ  i saw him close by where wright lives  at the duchess of kent public houseâ  he was not with wright at that timeâ  i know wright by seeing him  and drinking with him now and thenâ  we drank together that evening  me  wright  and gouldâ  i left first  i believe  but the other two went away directlyâ  i went home court  q  and went to bed  a  after i had done my businessâ  i had to wait on the company in the tap roomâ  i did nothing moreâ  i saw wright again  i believe  that night  at the duchess of kent public house  where he lives mr  ballantine  q  had you any conversation with wright when you saw him again  if you did see him  a  i do not know whether it was the same evening or next morning  it might be next morning he saw me  and we might stop and ask how we got on  and he brought it up about dickâ  he mentioned dick s name court  q  who came for you to day  a  i do not know his nameâ  he said i was wanted hereâ  he did not mention for what  to my knowledgeâ  he did not tell me what i was wanted forâ  he said i must come to the old bailey  or something of that sortâ  he said he wanted me along with himâ  he did not say what about  nothing at all q  do you mean to swear you had no idea what you were gong to be examined to before you went into that box  a  yes  i knew what it wasâ  i was up at hatton garden before  but my evidence was of no useâ  i was not examinedâ  i stated what i knew  and it was of no use cross examined  q  you stated what you had got to say  and then you were sent away  a  yesâ  i came here to day in a cab  with one of the servants  i expect  from this officeâ  he found me at the two brewers public houseâ  i had very little conversation with him in our wayâ  i have not seen wright here to dayâ  i heard him examined at hatton garden the last timeâ  he and i have talked about the matter sinceâ  we have sat together and talkedâ  i was at hatton garden the last time he was there  on tuesday  a week agoâ  i had never been there beforeâ  when i went up i found gould standing near the duchess of kent public houseâ  wright was not there thenâ  he came up about half a minute alter i met gouldâ  i cannot say what was said while we were talking together  nothing very particularâ  we drank a pint of porter  or whether it was a pint or a pot  i cannot sayâ  we drank it at the opposite corner to the duchess of kent  where wright livesâ  i mean outside the duchess of kentâ  we were about three minutes together there  it might be fourâ  we did not talk muchâ  we continued drinking till the pot was outâ  no one paid for the beer at that timeâ  we had beer out with us from my house and from the duchess of kentâ  i was carrying beer outâ  i cannot say whether the pot was taken out of my beer or out of wright sâ  we must have paid for it when we went homeâ  i paid say mistress for mineâ  i cannot say how much was drankâ  i cannot say whether it was a pint or a potâ  i cannot swear whether it was my master s beer  or wright s master s  that we drankâ  i might have paid my mistress for itâ  i paid for all i brought outâ  i cannot say how much i paid herâ  no money was produced by any body while we were drinkingâ  nothing was said about money to my knowledgeâ  i believe  when i saw wright he was coming along with his porterâ  i was talking with gould q  when they saw each other  did they ask each other how they did  or what was said  a  no  it appeared they had been together beforeâ  wright might have said   halloo â  i do not know that he didâ  i cannot recollect any thing that was saidâ  it might have been half past eight or nine o clockâ  i should say it was half past eight o clock  as near as i can recollect  because i was out with my porterâ  i go out with it at eight o clock  and i was just going homeâ  i might have some porter leftâ  i generally haveâ  i cannot say whether i had or not q  did you toss for any porter  a  we might have tossed  i do not recollect tossingâ  we might have been a pint each  or stood a pint  either one of usâ  i have no recollection whether we tossed  or whether we were a pint each  or whether one of us was a pintâ  i cannot say we did not tossâ  we might have tossed  and i forget itâ  i immediately went in  and was waiting on the customers after thatâ  i came out again that nightâ  i might come out with beer after thatâ  that would be at nine o clock  if it was half past eight beforeâ  if it was after nine o clock i did not come outâ  i do not sleep in the houseâ  i sleep with my wife  in st  george s court  dover roadâ  it might be twelve o clock when i went homeâ  i cannot recollect when i went home that nightâ  i cannot recollect who i saw when i was going home mr  ballantine  q  you were taking out beer for your mistressâ  what is the method  do you account for the number of pots you take out  a  i have to pay for all the porter i take out every dayâ  i never return anyâ  i pay for all every nightâ  the person who came to me this morning did not produce any thing  but had a cab for me to ride overâ  i live 200 or 300 yards from the public house i work atâ  i cannot swear whether i left that night before or after the house was closed charles allen  i live at wilson s cottage  pocock s fields  i am a boot and shoemakerâ  i have seen mr  templeman s house since his death  but not beforeâ  i know it nowâ  i should say it is between 300 and 500 yards from where i liveâ  i have known the prisoner  as near as i can tell  about twelve monthsâ  he has lodged at my house several timesâ  i cannot possibly state when he commenced lodging with me the last timeâ  he lodged with me at least seven nights before this occurredâ  i know he had very little money  if any  before the 16th of march  and i was confident  from circumstances which occurred  that he had no moneyâ  when he has come home of an evening he has said he had no money  and i considered by his getting up of a morning  and not having breakfast before he went out  that he had none  for few people like to go out without food  if they have money to purchase itâ  on the saturday night before this occurred he had none  because he made an observation when he came into the house that he had no money  but he should have some in the course of to morrow  which was sundayâ  on the monday morning following that saturday  i think he went out between eight and nine o clockâ  he had no breakfast with us before he went out that morningâ  i believe he was dressed something similar to what he is now  but i cannot positively swear whether he had that coat or a jacket onâ  as far as i can tell  i believe he was dressed much as he is nowâ  he had on a pair of shoes  which i madeâ  i did not make them for himâ  they were misfits  but i sold them to himâ  they were ancle shoes  similar to what i have on now  shoes the leather of which comes above the ancleâ  they had nailsâ  i saw gouldnailing them about a fortnight beforeâ  they were then getting the worse or wear  still they were wearableâ  i had seen them everyday on his feetâ  at the time i saw him nailing them they were fit for wear  i am certain  and would have lasted much longer for nice fine weather than for wetâ  i have no recollection whether he went out alone or in company that morningâ  i have no recollection of seeing any body before he went outâ  the next time i saw him was  as near as i can tell  on the tuesday morning about three o clockâ  i was then lying in my own bed  and my wife likewiseâ  he came into the houseâ  it was very light at the time  the moon shiningâ  it was the lightness of the moonâ  the instant he came into the house he went into his bed room  as the door opens into the roomâ  he opens his bed room door and closes the front door while he passes to his bed roomâ  my wife said to him   richard  it is early   or  late   i am not sure which  and his reply was   it is early â  nothing more passedâ  the next time i saw him was  i believe  between eight and nine o clock on the tuesday morningâ  we have no clock to judge the time  but as near as i can tell i saw him between eight and nineâ  i got up between six and sevenâ  he got up between eight and nineâ  i was in my sitting roomâ  he came into it  passed through  and went to the wash houseâ  the wash house leads to the privy and to the back yardâ  he remained in the wash house  as near as i can tell  from twenty five minutes to half an hourâ  when he came out of his bed room he had his coat and waistcoat on his arm  and i believe his boots in his hand  but i am not certain whether they were on his feet or in his handâ  when he returned  he came through the room where i was sitting at breakfast  and went out at the front doorâ  he went straight from the wash house to the front door and went outâ  i observed nothing particular about him when he went outâ  i believe he had on the same clothes he has nowâ  he had on the same shoes as i had made him  but they were blackedâ  when he was in a situation he blacked them every morning  but not at other timesâ  how he got the brushes to clean them i do not know  but the brushes were in the back place when he was goneâ  they were my brushes and blackingâ  if he used it  it was my blacking q  can you tell whether  on this night  he used any candle or rush light to go to bed  a  i never saw richard have a candle in our house all the time he was in it  unless he asked for such a thing  and that was very seldomâ  if he wanted one it was merely for a minute to get something out of the room  and he was supplied by our candle which stood on the tableâ  i have not found any candle or rush light about my premises since that nightâ  he returned about a quarter past seven o clock on the tuesday evening  much about that timeâ  i had heard of the murder about half past ten  or near eleven o clockâ  when the prisoner came home i was gone to fetch a pint of porter and a rasher of bacon for supperâ  when i returned he was sitting in my room talking to my wifeâ  the conversation when i came into the house was  i believe  on the subject of the murderâ  the first time  i believe  i spoke  or richard spoke to me  was   it is a shocking thing  do you consider he could not have done it himself  â  the reply i made was   richard  how could it be possible for persons to do such things themselves  having their hands tied and their eyes blindfolded  is it likely  â  that is all the conversation i remember between richard and me  till afterwardsâ  he was sitting at the table a few minutes after  then got up and went into the back placeâ  he went through the wash house  as if he was going to the privyâ  he said his inside was out of order  and he went out at the door as ifgoing to the privyâ  he did not remain there more than six or seven minutesâ  i mentioned to my wife a circumstance which had occurred  and when he came back and sat down i was eating some bacon on a piece of breadâ  i cut off a piece of baconâ  it fell on my knee  and went a contrary way to himâ  i then cut another piece  and it went towards his legsâ  i did it purposely  to satisfy myself of something i thought concerning him  that he had got a new pair of shoesâ  i had a suspicion that he knew something about itâ  then i did a thing which i have no doubt he understood  i took the candle off the table  and put it between his legsâ  he directly put up his legs and hid his shoes behind the legs of the chair  and then began the conversationâ  he said he had been over the water to see his cousin  who had a pair of shoes which did not fit him  and he had jumped into themâ  before that  he said he should like to have something to eat  and asked if i would go and fetch him a slice of bacon and a pot of beerâ  i said   richard  why not go yourself and fetch it  â  he said   you know i don t want to go out â  i knew that there was an assault warrant out against himâ  i fetched him a slice of bacon  a pot of beer  and half an ounce of tobaccoâ  he gave me 1s  to pay for itâ  he said he had been over to clapham  limehouse  blackwall  and that way  and called on hit cousins and aunts  and they had given him some moneyâ  he did not say how muchâ  after i had fetched the beer we had some conversation respecting the preceding night  what a shocking  dreadful affair it was  how any body could have committed such a horrible crimeâ  it was no more than common conversation respecting the murderâ  the conversation took place chiefly with my wifeâ  i did not pay attention  my attendon was engaged at that timeâ  i recollect asking richard how it was he was so lateâ  he said he had been to mr  frimley s till twelve o clock  and when he came from there he lit on some friends who detained himâ  i should say he was in bed before nine o clock on tuesday night  or about that timeâ  when he had gone to bed  in consequence of suspicions i entertained  i bolted him inâ  i did not give information at allâ  the policemen came at eleven o clock that night  as near as i can tell  and took himâ  i had at one time a cheese knife in my possession  which i have since foundâ  i had also a piece of wood in my possessionâ  i believe it was plum tree or damson  rather better than a foot and a half long  and about two and a i half inches wide  with sharp edges  and flatâ  it was very smoothâ  the edges were sharpâ  it was to set seams withâ  it is a heavy woodâ  i used it in my business q  have you told us all the conversation  as far as you recollect  that took place between you and the prisoner on the subject of the murder  a  as far as happened  except part that my wife was speaking to himâ  there was a conversation on scriptureâ  i recollect in one part richard said  if the ten commandments were just  or the mosaic law was right  he had broken them all  for adultery he had committed many times  and drunkennessâ  and then that conversation dropped with me  and went on with my wifeâ  i got up to go into the yardâ  that was at the time we were talking of the murderâ  it was all in the same conversationâ  i saw some money produced in a stocking at the station house at islingtonâ  neither the money or the stocking was my propertyâ  i believe one farthing was all the money in the house at all that dayâ  i have never been in the habit of keeping money in the wash house or privyâ  we have not had any to do it cross examined  q  were you present during all the time your wifewas in conversation with the prisoner that evening  a  certainly notâ  i went to fetch some beer  therefore i could notâ  i went to fetch the beer and bacon after he came homeâ  it was not his bacon i cut when i discovered his shoes  it was my own baconâ  i did that while the prisoner was sitting at the table  before i went to fetch his baconâ  i believe i ate my own supper before i fetched his q  at that time had there been any conversation about the murder  a  the conversation might have been about the murder  but i took very little notice of any of the conversation  therefore am not bound to answer the question q  now i ask you to answer the question  had any conversation taken place about the murder before  as you say  you cut the bacon  and saw his new shoes  a  i have already answered that the conversation when i entered the house was on that subject  but i paid so little attention to the conversation between my wife and the prisoner  that probably i could not utter fifty words of the conversation the whole evening  unless the prisoner spoke to meâ  i mean  i could not utter fifty words of the conversation between the prisoner and my wife  except i had the leading point to lead to it  namedâ  there was a good deal of conversation between him and my wifeâ  i had some suspicion at the time i discovered the new shoesâ  i cannot say whether it was after that that i went and fetched the bacon for the prisonerâ  i believe i had eaten my own supper before i fetched it  but i will not swear itâ  i am not confident whether the bacon was cooked before or after q  at the time you went out to fetch the bacon  had you any suspicion as you have stated  a  certainly i had at the time  and beforeâ  i had before he came into the houseâ  i fetched it from a person of the name ofâ  â  i cannot recollectâ  it was about a hundred yards offâ  i was absent about ten minutes or a quarter of an hourâ  on my return i found the prisoner sitting at the table in conversation with my wifeâ  as soon as his bacon was cooked he had his supper  smoked his pipe  and went to bedâ  when i bolted him in his bed room i said   he is in  he shall never come out any snore by me â  if my face had been towards him i think he may have heard that  but my back being towards him  he might or might notâ  it is a question i cannot answerâ  i sever bolted him in beforeâ  i have merely put the bolt to to keep the children in of a morning  but not bolted him inâ  the window of his room looks into the front gardenâ  it is about two feet and a half or three feet from the groundâ  i cannot tell whether he paid me for the old shoes which i made himâ  what i have no dealings with i never answer  i left it to my wifeâ  he paid her in part  whether she had the whole i cannot tell  i know nothing of itâ  i have been ill this twelvemonth  and have had very little dealings with any person whateverâ  i have done very little shoe making within the last twelve monthsâ  i was once in the policeâ  i left it  i think  eight years agoâ  i went after the first division that went to whitechapelâ  i was in it  as near as i can tell  a year and four or five monthsâ  i left it entirely of my own accord  without any complaint being made q  now  do i understand you distinctly that there was a great deal of conversation that you cannot recollect  a  yes  distinctly  that i know nothing of whateverâ  if it were repeated  i believe  i might then tell  but not without  for i did not pay the least attention to itâ  i did not take any notice  very little indeed  for my thoughts were far beyond any conversationâ  i did not want to hold any conversationâ  my two children slept with the prisonerâ  one is about six years old at michaelmas  and the other four years oldâ  they were in the bed with him that night court  q  why did you bar the door  i do not understand  a  because i had a suspicion he knew something of the chargeâ  barring the door would prevent his getting out q  could he not get out of the window  a  that he might  but he could not get into my room  and if he had got out of the door i did not mean to go to sleepâ  i was not particularly afraid of him  but i did not intend that he should have gone out of my house  without he did get upâ  if he did get up i should have given informationâ  it was for the public interest as well as my own mary ann allbn  i am the wife of the last witness  the prisoner lodged at our house  and did so on the 17th of march lastâ  i do not know mr  templeman s cottage  i never saw itâ  i know it is but a short distance from our houseâ  i have never been to it  but i know where it isâ  the prisoner has been lodging with us nearly a twelvemonth  off and onâ  the last time he was with us for a whole week  the only week he has been with us since he had been at the barnsbury castle public houseâ  he was with us from saturday night till the tuesday week  a week and two daysâ  he did not pay meâ  i never received any money from him for that  because he had noneâ  he told me he had no money many times court  q  did he not pay you at any time during the twelvemonth  a  yesâ  the last time he came to us was the saturday week previous to the murder mr  ballantine  q  when did he tell you he had no money  a  frequentlyâ  he did not take his meals with us generally since he has been out of employâ  he did not take his meals with us at all in this week  only after the sundayâ  he took his meals with us two sundaysâ  mrs  jarvis brought him some bacon and eggs on the sunday morning  as he came on saturday nightâ  on the following sunday   the sunday previous to the murder   he asked me if i had any breakfast  he wanted some breakfastâ  i did not answer him  because we had none in the house ourselvesâ  that was between eight and nine o clockâ  he said he should go over the water to his cousin s  but his handkerchief was so dirty  and i lent him a stock of my husband sâ  he then went out directlyâ  he returned at one o clock in the dayâ  i was at homeâ  he said he had been out  and drank too much beer  and it had made him very ill on an empty stomachâ  he went out  and was very sickâ  he came in again  and i asked him if he would have some dinnerâ  he said he was too illâ  he asked if he might lie downâ  i said he might  and he did soâ  my little boy called him up at five o clock  for me to make the bed  and put the children to bedâ  he had gone to lie down in his own roomâ  my children slept with himâ  he got up  and came into the room where i was sittingâ  he asked me if i had got any teaâ  i told him i had notâ  he asked me to let my little boy go and fetch him some  for he had taken 1s  while he was outâ  my little boy did fetch him someâ  he said   i have got 6d  left â  he gave my little boy 6d   and he fetched some tea and sugarâ  i made him some toastâ  he had his tea  and went to bedâ  on the following morning   monday   before he got up  mrs  jarvis came  i think  about eight o clock  or a little afterâ  she came to my door and asked if richard was upâ  i said   no â  i opened the door  and she called   richard â  if the front door is open you can hear any bodyspeak at the door in his bed roomâ  she said   make haste and get up  it is breakfast time â  she then went outâ  she did not go into his roomâ  he got up directly  and said   i must make haste  if not i shall be too late for my breakfast   and he went outâ  that was the last i saw of him that dayâ  i was ill that night  and went to bed before eight o clockâ  my husband went to bed at the same time q  are you able to say at what time the prisoner came home  a  yes  i think it was past two o clock  i am quite sureâ  when he came in i said   richard  it is morning â  he said   it is early â  he then went into his bed roomâ  he did not fasten the doorâ  he had no fastening insideâ  on the tuesday morning he got up at half past seven o clockâ  i had been up ever since six o clock  and was getting my husband s breakfastâ  i bad not gone to sleep after the prisoner came inâ  i was weaning my baby  and did not go to sleep any moreâ  my baby was so restless  i got out of bed three timesâ  it was soon daylight after he came homeâ  it was moonlight when he came home  it was very lightâ  i was up three times after be came in  before six o clock  and i did not go to sleepâ  i began weaning my baby that day and she was very illâ  i watched the morning  and i know it was towards morning when he came inâ  i am quite sure it was near three o clockâ  we have no clock in the houseâ  i am quite sure it was nearer three than two o clock  but i say two o clock court  q  how came you to say between one and two o clock before  a  i said  from one o clock â  i was sure it was quite towards morning  because it was so soon daylight q  that is no answer to why you should say between one and two o clock  a  i cannot speak nearer than i haveâ  i know it was soon morning  and i did not go to sleep after he came inâ  it was very bright moonlight when he came in mr  ballantine  q  you say you were in the room at the time the prisoner came into it in the morning  a  yes  in my own roomâ  he went immediately through my room into the wash houseâ  there is a privy connected with the wash houseâ  he went into the privy  for i heard the door  and the door makes a noiseâ  about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards i went into the wash house  and saw him standing by the table doing something to his trowsersâ  i did not stand long enough to notice what he was doingâ  i turned away  and went into my own roomâ  it was to the top part of his trowsers that he was doing somethingâ  he was not stooping  but standing uprightâ  i cannot say whether he was wiping or rubbing them  or what he was doingâ  i did not pay attentionâ  i do not think he was buttoning themâ  he did not appear buttoning themâ  i did not stop long enough to notice whether the privy door was shutâ  he was quite out of the privy  standing by the window in the wash houseâ  i then returned into the sitting roomâ  i suppose it was ten minutes  or not quite so long  before he came inâ  i did not pay any attentionâ  he asked for a towel when he came in  which i gave him  and he wiped his face with itâ  it might be twenty minutes from the time he went into the wash house till he came out  or it might be longerâ  it might be half an hourâ  i heard the noise of the privy door once  when he went inâ  my husband was going to send me again  as he wanted something out of the wash house  but i said   no  i won t go in  for richard is doing something to his trowsers  and i did not goâ  i do not know how long he remained in the privyâ  when he came out he bid me good morning  and went outâ  i did not pay any attention to his shoes at that timeâ  he returned at a quarter past seven o clock in theeveningâ  i had in the mean time heard of the death of mr  templemanâ  my husband had gone out when the prisoner returnedâ  i said   it is well you have come in so soon to night  richard  i would not have left my door open any more  in consequence of the murder and robbery near me â  upon which he said   i have just heard something about it at the rainbow â  he had just called at rainbowâ  i asked him how it was he had not heard of it beforeâ  in a few minutes after that my husband came in  and he stood by the tableâ  he came in as i was speaking to richard  and the conversation droppedâ  after my husband came in he went through my room to the privyâ  that might be a minute after my husband came inâ  it might be two  i cannot sayâ  when he came back he said   i don t feel very well  i suppose i am horror struck like the rest â  he then asked my husband to fetch him a drop of beer  and he fetched him some beer  a rasher of bacon  and tobaccoâ  while my husband was gone for the beer  i said   this is a shocking affair  richard â  he said   it is  i know very little about it â  i asked him where he had been that dayâ  he told me he bad been and called on his aunt  or seen his aunt  i do not know which  and he had had good luck  and the old lady was glad to see himâ  and he had called on his cousin  and his cousin had a pair of shoes that were too large for him  and he had given them to himâ  my husband came in during the latter part of this conversation with the beer and things he had been sent out forâ  i put the rasher on the fire  and broiled it for the prisoner  and he ate itâ  we then went on talking togetherâ  i asked him where he had been over nightâ  he said he bad been to the rainbow public house  that be went in with a pint  and came out with a pintâ  i said   you could not have been there till that time in the morning â  he said   i was gossipping â  that is all he saidâ  there was other conversationâ  i do not know of any thing particularâ  he said  in speaking of his situation   many poor creatures like me would rather be hung than transported â  he was speaking of the difficulties he was in  that he was out of work  and in trouble  and a good deal of conversation to that effectâ  he had often said he had never known so much trouble as he had done this winterâ  i saw the stocking in which the money was found in the privy q  do know to whom that stocking belonged  a  i saw a pair of stockings rolled up on a box  at the side of the prisoner s bed on monday afternoon  at the time i made the bedâ  i cannot say whether it was five o clock  or what timeâ  it was in the afternoonâ  it might be five o clockâ  it was while the prisoner was outâ  i took hold of the stockings and laid them down  and thought to myself  they are richard s stockingsâ  i knew them to be similar to what he always woreâ  i washed for himâ  they were exactly like what he wore  and did not belong to meâ  they belonged to richardâ  they did not belong to me  and are like what i used to wash for himâ  i believe them to be hisâ  he had two pain of stockings when i washed for him  before he went to mr  bartlett sâ  i washed for him three weeks after he went thereâ  i had washed a pair of stockings similar to those for him  just before christmasâ  that is all i knowâ  my children s clothes were not kept in that roomâ  nobody s clothes but the prisoner s would be kept in that roomâ  they were two odd stockings  i had mismatched them when i washed them  i think it must have been six week before christmas when i mis matched themâ  these were formerly two pairs  and i put one stocking of one pair to another court  q  but he could have rightly matched them afterwards  a he never did while i washed for him  because they came off together  and were washed together mr  ballantine  q  do you remember his coming home wet footed one day  a  when he was out with baked potatoes he came home wet in the feet  and i gave him a dirty stocking to pot on  a dry oneâ  that is the way they became mismatchedâ  directly i saw the stocking in which the money was found  i said that was the one i had seenâ  i knew it belonged to richard  and it was on the box on the mondayâ  i am quite sure of thatâ  i am quite sure it was the same stocking i had seen by the side of the bed on monday cross examined  q  who washed for him when he returned to lodge with you for the week  a  i do not knowâ  his dirty things were not sent to the washâ  i never saw any in the houseâ  they were not pot up in a bundleâ  none of his things were put up in a bundleâ  i never said any thing about a bundleâ  i never said i opened a bundle  to ascertain whether they were two stockings  or odd onesâ  i have no recollection of saying any thing about the stockings being in a bundleâ  they laid folded together on the box  one turned over the other  rolled up  and the one produced to me was the one which laid outsideâ  they were rolled up in a bundle  the same as a clean pair of stockingsâ  i did not unrol the bundleâ  they were rolled up in the ordinary form of a pair of stockings  one doubled over the otherâ  the one the money was produced in was the outer stockingâ  i did not unrol them at all on the mondayâ  i took them in my handâ  i do not know who washed for him thenâ  there was no mark on the stockingsâ  i do not think the prisoner bad been out of place above a fortnight when he came to lodge with us the last timeâ  he came and had a night s lodging now and thenâ  i do not know how long he had left mr  bartlett  of the barnsbury castle public house  when he came the last weekâ  when he was in employment he paid me 2s  a weekâ  we never made any agreement this timeâ  i knew he was out of emyloyment and never asked him for any thingâ  if he had got any employment i should have expected the same weekly sumâ  he did not board with usâ  it was the sunday morning after the saturday that he came that mrs  jarvis brought him some bacon and bread for his breakfastâ  it was on the monday morning she came and called him to come to breakfastâ  he was in bed  and she was outside the houseâ  it was after eight o clock  it might be ten minutes after eightâ  he owed us some money for his former lodgingâ  he often  asked me for an account  but as he had no money i never gave it himâ  i never cast it upâ  it might be 1l  or more  if i east it up  because i often let him have his dinner  and any thing of that sortâ  he told me  several times during the week  that he had no moneyâ  he told me he was in great difficulties  and was without moneyâ  many times he mentioned the subject q  you have ventured to say now that it was past two o clock  were you always of that opinion  a  yes  always of opinion that it was towards morningâ  i was always of opinion it was past two o clock when he came inâ  i am quite sure it was after two o clock  according to the time it was daylight afterwardsâ  to the best of my belief it was after two o clockâ  i cannot say whether i was certain of the time when i went to the police office  as i was very much flurried and ill q  did you not believe  when at the police office  that it was between one and two o clock  a  certainly it must have been two o clock fromthe time it was lightâ  i think it was two o clockâ  i believed it was two o clock  because it got so soon daylight  but i had no clock q  since you have been at the police office  have you conversed with your husband about the time he came home  a  my husband said  when he came home   mary  richard did not come home till morning â  i believe my husband did not speak when the prisoner came in  because i spokeâ  i did not ask my husband whether he was awake  nor did i speakâ  i was out of bed three times to nurse my childâ  the prisoner got up between seven and eight o clock next morning  and went through the wash house to the privyâ  there is a catch to the privy doorâ  it is what i term a night boltâ  it shuts and boltsâ  there is another entrance to it from the gardenâ  if the door is shut you must go through the wash houseâ  if the door is open you can come in that wayâ  the bolt is in the wash houseâ  it is the wash house door boltâ  the privy door was off its hinges at that timeâ  the privy joins the wash house  and when in the privy you can go out of the privy into the gardenâ  you cannot get into the wash house without the door is left openâ  you can get to the privy  through the wash house  without going into the gardenâ  the privy has two doorsâ  the door leading to the garden was off its hinges at that timeâ  i heard of mr  templeman s death  i think  at twelve o clock in the dayâ  i had been outâ  my husband went up  and he told me all the particulars when he came home  of the old gentleman being murderedâ  i cannot remember whether be told me any thing about the state he was found in on the floorâ  i knew all about it  and began to talk to the prisoner about it before my husband came inâ  when he came in he broke upon the conversation q  was his going for the bacon and beer the only occasion when your husband went out that night  a  yesâ  with the exception of that interval he heard every thing that took placeâ  when my husband said richard had got a new pair of shoes  i said   i think not  i think he has blacked and shined his old ones â  he said so to me the moment richard walked across the room  while he was gone to the privyâ  when he came back from the privy he asked my husband to fetch him a drop of beer  and i believe he went out to fetch itâ  i think he was eating his supper court  q  when did your husband remark about his having new shoes  a  when he came in  he walked through the room  and went into the privy before he sat down  when he came in in the evening q  i thought your husband was out when he came in  a  my husband was out  but he had stood talking to me by the table  and had not sat down when my husband came in mr  chambers  q  was it in consequence of your husband saying he had new shoes that he said he got them from his cousin  a  i do not know  but he said thatâ  i did not ask him about the shoesâ  my husband looked at them  and so did iâ  i never asked where he got themâ  he said he had been very lucky that day q  was it not after that  he talked so despondingly as you say about being such an unlucky man  a  it was during the conversation mr  ballantine  q  you did not unrol the stockings by the bedside  a  no  i merely took them in my handâ  when they brought me the stocking in  i said   there was a pair of stockings on the box on monday â  i am quite sure that was the outside stocking the money was tied in  and i am quite sure  by the feel of the stockings  that there was more than one court  q  how could you tell there were two odd ones  a  i said to the policeman   there is a pair of stockings â  the policeman found the other slocking in my room  behind the boxâ  they were two odd stockings  and i said i had mis matched them when i washed them john frimley  i keep the rainbow public house  in the liverpool road  islington  i know the prisonerâ  he was at my house on the 16th and 17th of marchâ  on monday  the 16th  he was there most part of the afternoon  and until twenty minutes before twelve o clock at nightâ  i did not see him come in in the afternoonâ  i saw him first about four o clockâ  he was playing at skittlesâ  he afterwards came into the tap roomâ  about a little after ten o clock the gas was turned out in the skittle ground  and he came into the tap roomâ  he remained there till twenty minutes before twelve o clock  and then went away in company with the others that were thereâ  there were five or six people  some of them witnessesâ  king and his wife  and pizey  were thereâ  on the following day  tuesday  i saw him at my house between two and three o clock in the afternoonâ  i saw him last at seven o clockâ  he was then in the tap roomâ  i believe he was there after seven  but i last saw him at sevenâ  my house is about half a mile from allen s  and nearly the same distance from mr  templeman s cottage cross examined  q  i suppose you generally shut up about twelve o clock  a  yesâ  he and his party went away in consequence of my shutting up robert king  i am a chimney sweeper  and live at no  8  felix street  islingtonâ  i was at frimley s skittle ground on monday evening  the 16th of marchâ  the prisoner was playing thereâ  he began playing about half past seven or eight o clockâ  he said  when he first came into the ground  that he only had three halfpence in his pocket  and if either of as would bet odd or even  he might have enough for a pint  but nobody betted with himâ  he then played at skittles for a pot of beer  i believeâ  he had some beer to drinkâ  i think it was very near eleven o clock when we came out of thereâ  i know he did not lose any thing  because i was in the ground all the timeâ  he did not win any moneyâ  he won beerâ  he did not say any thing after playing that i heardâ  i went into the tap room with him afterwardsâ  when he first came into the ground he said he had three halfpence  and as he did not lose it he came into the tap room with itâ  he bought a candle for a 1d â  i did not see him buy it cross examined  q  how much is a pot of beer  a  4d â  it is 5d  in the skittle ground robert pizey  i live at no  17  elder walk  i was in the skittle ground of the rainbow public house on monday  the 16th of march  and saw the prisoner thereâ  i afterwards went into the tap roomâ  i was going out for some tobacco  and when i was going out the prisoner asked me to fetch him a rush lightâ  he gave me two halfpenceâ  i bought one  and gave it to the prisoner cross examined  q  did you play with him at skittles  a  i had a game with himâ  he had not his coat off when he playedâ  when we were shut out of the ground we went up to the tap room mary elizabeth king  i am the wife of robert king  i was at the rainbow public house on the 16th of marchâ  i went there about twenty minutes to twelve o clock  to fetch my husbandâ  i saw the prisoner thereâ  i remember the gas being turned offâ  the people did not all come outtogetherâ  i went out firstâ  they came about five minutes afterâ  i observed the prisoner particularlyâ  he had on a fustian coat  the same he has on nowâ  i noticed it because i saw something in his right hand pocketâ  it was long  and thick at one endâ  it was in the outside side pocket  like a shooting jacket pocketâ  there were two pockets  one on each side  rather in frontâ  no part of what he had was uncoveredâ  it must have been about a quarter to twelve o clock when i noticed itâ  it was at the time he was going awayâ  i did not see pizey go for the candleâ  the instrument was the length of his pocketâ  it was lying long ways in his pocket  across the bottom of his pocketâ  the ends seemed to be differentâ  i saw this in his turning his back to the fire placeâ  after we came out  i and my husband went one way  and the prisoner went along towards the chapel of easeâ  that is in the direction of mr  templeman s cottageâ  it was before twelve o clock cross examined  q  how many of you were there came out of the tap room together  a  mr  and mrs  shepherd  pizey  the prisoner  my husband  and myselfâ  mr  and mrs  shepherd went homeâ  they lodge at our houseâ  we all went home together  only they got home firstâ  i have always said i knew which way the prisoner wentâ  i have not said  i did not recollect which way he went james miller  i am an inspector of the n division of police  i apprehended the prisoner at allen s cottage  on tuesday night  the 17th of march  at a quarter after eleven o clockâ  i found him in the bed room  in bed with two childrenâ  i said   gould  gould â  he appeared to arouse from sleep  and said   what  what  â  i said nothing more at that momentâ  a light was procured  and i again roused him  and said   gould  get up and dress yourselfâ  he appeared still drowsyâ  i told him to get upâ  he then got out of bed  and on getting out of bed  he said   where is your warrant   i replied   i don t need a warrant â  he then said   what do you want me for then  â  i said   i suppose you have beard of the murder â  it is that i want you for â  he smiled  and said   if i was as innocent of every thing as i am of that  i should not have much to fear â  i do not recollect his saying any thing more thenâ  as he was packing up his clothes to dress himself  i found 9s  in his trowsers  pockets  all in shillingsâ  while i was counting it  i asked what money he had  and he said 9s â  in his waist coat pocket i found seven lucifer matches  and two duplicates for a pair of trowsers and a jacket  dated   22nd february  1340  2s  6d    and  25th february  1840  35  â  one in the name of richard gould  and the other in the name of ann jarvisâ  on the way to the station he said that a pot boy at the william public house had taken a warrant out against him for an assault  and it was that he supposed i was after him forâ  i had missed him for some time  and asked where he had beenâ  he said   to norwich â  i searched him at the station house  and took off his feet a pair of new shoes  or ankle boots  which i produceâ  i asked him where he bought themâ  he said  in kent streetâ  a constable who was standing by  said   the borough  â  the prisoner said   yes â  i then asked him what he had done with his old onesâ  he replied   thrown them away â  shortly after that  i minutely examined his clothes  and took from him this waist coat  which he was wearing at the timeâ  he had three waistcoats onâ  two besides thisâ  this was the middle oneâ  this waistcoat i noticed at the time was stained with blood  and it is also burnt in one particular spot  as if a cinder or a pipe had fallen on itâ  on my saying that the waistcoatwas stained with blood  the prisoner said his clothes had often been stained with bloodâ  i afterwards went to allen s cottage that same morning court  q  have you had the waistcoat examined in the same way as a bag was  a  noâ  the bag was examined  and discovered that what was upon it was not bloodâ  this has not been examined in the same way mr  jones  q  did you search the bed room in which you apprehended the prisoner  a  i did  and found this single stocking thereâ  it is a fine stockingâ  it was lying on a chair by the side of a boxâ  it was dirtyâ  the prisoner bad stockings on when he dressed himselfâ  i have examined them sinceâ  they were a pair  i believeâ  i did not take them offâ  perhaps i did not take notice enough to say whether they were a pair or notâ  i judged they were a pairâ  i did not show that stocking to mrs  allenâ  i did not search any other part of allen s premises  except the bed room  where i took the prisonerâ  i found the stocking about a quarter after eight o clock on the wednesday morning cross examined  q  you went there about a quarter past eleven o clock  a  i didâ  allen opened the door to meâ  we were not more than a minute before we got inâ  allen had no light with himâ  allen sleeps in the room i first enteredâ  i knocked at the doorâ  he answered me from the inside  from his bedâ  he got out of bed in his shirt to let me inâ  after i had got into the prisoner s room  allen got a lightâ  i remained there about ten minutesâ  the prisoner put on all the three waistcoatsâ  he put on every thing he had  to carry it off on his backâ  i opened his bed room door myselfâ  i found two little children thereâ  they were awoke by the noiseâ  they both appeared aroused  but did not seem to know what was going onâ  he was sleeping between the two childrenâ  i knew there was an assault warrant against himâ  i know that he occasionally foughtâ  i have heard that the assault warrant arose from a fight mr  jones  q  did you observe how the prisoner s door was fastened  a  it was bolted outsideâ  i saw the deceased while he was lying deadâ  i took the rope from his wristâ  this is itâ   producing it â  the noose was put over the right hand  and the other end tied to itâ  there was no knot tied at allâ  the hands were firmly bound court  q  in your judgment  could that he done without two people  a  i think one person might do it  though the other was struggling  particularly if he was an old and feeble man richard bradshaw  i am a policeman of the n division  i went to allen s cottage on wednesday with sergeant king  and made search of the premisesâ  i saw king put his hand over the partition parting the privy from an out house or wash house  and find a stockingâ  it laid between the rafters and tiles of the wash houseâ  he stood on the seat of the privy  and reached it downâ  it was put over the wash house roofâ  i did not see what the stocking containedâ  king took it away with him thomas hobbs king  i am a sergeant of the n division  i accompanied bradshaw to allen s cottage on wednesday morningâ  i searched the premises  and found a stocking between the ceiling of the back kitchen and the roof or tiles of the privy and back kitchenâ  i had to lean over  and put my arm round behind the rafterâ  seeing something white  i stood on the seat of the privy to reach itâ  it was by the first rafter belonging to the wash house  placed round the cornerâ  it it full five feet from the seat of the privy to the rafterâ  i should not think a short person could have put it there  standing on the seatâ  a person as tall as the prisoner could or as tall as allenâ  i examined the stockingâ  it contained nineteen half crowns  forty eight shillings  and seven sixpences  making 4l  19s  together cross examined  q  when was it you went  a  about seven o clock on wednesday morningâ  i believe all that money has been examined very minutely  to find a particular marked shilling  but it could not be found court  q  what marked shilling were you looking for  a  mrs  morgan or mrs  lovett stated that she had a particular shilling in her possession marked s  i think  but she did not know whether she paid it away before she gave the deceased the money or notâ  there is a marked half crown  which cannot be spoken toâ  all the money in my possession has been very closely examined mr  jonestomart allen  q  look at that stocking  and see whether or not you know it  a  this is the stocking that was folded outsideâ  there is no mark on it that i know it byâ  here is the other stockingâ   looking at one â  this is exactly the same sort of topâ  that i mis matched for the prisoner when i washed for himâ  he had a pair of themâ  i washed for him six months  but not during the last time he was thereâ  there is nothing on either of the stockings to enable me to identify themâ  it is merely being alike court  q  there is a difference in the length  a  i had footed them for him  and i may have taken them up then mr  jones  q  when did you foot them for him  a  when i washed for himâ  i cut the feet off  and put fresh feet onâ  i did not knit fresh feet  i cut an old stocking up  and put themâ  this one has been footedâ  i cannot say it is my work  but i footed stockings like theseâ  they have been both doneâ  i cannot tell my own work cross examined  q  you know who washes for him now  do not you  a  he never told meâ  he took the washing awayâ  i never saw him take his things from my house  and i never saw him put any on in my houseâ  i asked him the last time   richard  don t you want your things washed   â  he said   no  i have got somebody else to wash for me â  i guess it is mrs  jarvisâ  i do not know where mrs  jarvis isâ  i never saw her  only when she came to my house for richard  nor did i know where she lived before the murder took placeâ  i did not know whether she lived in great bride street or the fields  i knew it was in the neighbourhood john ellis  i am a painter  and live at no  11  madras place  hollo way on tuesday  the 17th of march  i met the prisoner about a quarter after two o clock  as near as i can guessâ  i had seen mrs  jarvis before that  at nine o clock in the morning  near prospect cottages  thornhill road  at the top of john streetâ  she was going towards islington turn pikeâ  that is the road to town  you can go that way to itâ  when i met the prisoner about two o clock mrs  jarvis was in his companyâ  she had a child with her both in the morning and at two o clockâ  i had not heard of the murder of mr  templeman when i saw her in the morningâ  i heard of it at one o clockâ  when i met them at two o clock i asked mrs  jarvis if she had been at homeâ  she said   no â  i said   well  there is a little bit of a stir at your village    it is about a quarter of a mile from where i met themâ  they were going towards the cottagesâ  i was going to work from the cottages  and they met me â  she said   is there  â  i said   yes   and then hesitated for a momentâ  i then said  the old gentleman i had heard  had been murderedâ  she said   what old gentleman  do you mean  mr  templeman  â  i said   yes â  she said   then i will go home and see â  she then turned to the prisoner  and said   richard  or dick  you had better not go home with me now then â   yes   said he   i shall go and see what is up â  they then turned  and went onâ  i did not see how far they wentâ  that was all the conversation that passed between us richard bradshawre examined  my attention was directed to jarvis s cottage on the tuesday  i watched it from about two o clock till eight o clock at night on the 17thâ  i saw mrs  jams about a quarter before three o clock at the entrance of the cottage cutting some wood to light the fireâ  she had a child with her thomas bottom  i am a mathematical instrument maker  on tuesday  the 17th of march  between half past twelve and a quarter to one o clock  i went into the tap room of the general wolfe public house  little gray s inn laneâ  when i went in the prisoner was there smoking a short pipe and drinkingâ  he had something in a pewter pot  i cannot say whatâ  while i was there another man came in  who i since know to be marshâ  a person tapped at the tap room window  the next window to me  where the prisoner was sittingâ  the prisoner beckoned the person in  and a female came in with a child in her armsâ  she was a young womanâ  she sat down in the roomâ  she shortly afterwards went out  and the prisoner went two or three minutes afterâ  it was about two o clock when he went away  a minute or two before or after court  q  did the people speak when they were in the room  a  no ralph wilcoxon  i am a boot and shoe maker  and live at no  93  tottenham court roadâ  i consider this pair of boots produced by miller  were purchased at one of my shopsâ  they are marked 92 and 8  which is a private markâ  the 8 is the size  the 92 is the private markâ  i have seven shops  one in howland street  another in tottenham court road  two in oxford street  one in regent street  one in walker s court  berwick street  soho  and one in king william street  london bridgeâ  i live in tottenham court roadâ  i was there on the 17th of marchâ  my daughter resides thereâ  she is occasionally in the shop when i am up stairs q  now do you remember on the 17th of march  your daughter bringing you a half sovereign  a  to the best of my recollection she brought me a half sovereign to take 7s  6d  out of itâ  to the best of ray recollection it was between twelve and one o clock in the dayâ  the price of these boots  is about 7s  6d â  that is about the selling priceâ  we might sell them for 7s â  i was in the howland street shop  up stairs  when my daughter brought the half sovereign to meâ  that and the tottenham court road shop communicateâ  it is half a mile from there to gray s inn lane  or perhaps three quartersâ  7s  6d  would be the price we should ask for the bootsâ  92 means the cost priceâ  if i was selling the boots i should ask 7s  6d cross examined  q  who marks the cost price  a  sometimes one  sometimes anotherâ  all of my shop men know the markâ  when my shop men leave my service  they know it just as well  and i now know that they use it as wellâ  i did not beforeâ  i only know one who uses my mark  that is mr  wright  who has a shop in lambeth walk  where i sold him the business and the stock  and i believe he has another shop at the marsh gate  westminster roadâ  i now know he uses the same mark asmeâ  i have  i should say  40 000 pairs of shoes in a yearâ  i have now a stock of 40 000 for my different shopsâ  the shoes are all made in the country  and wright deals with the same manufacturer  but i did not know that till to dayâ  i have brought mr  wright here with me mr  ballantine  q  do you know any thing about his goods being marked the same  a  yesâ  i went into the shop and saw his mark hannah wilcoxon  i am the daughter of the last witnessâ  i was in the shop in tottenham court road on the 17th of marchâ  i received a half sovereign that day from mr  wills  my father s shopmanâ  i took it up to my father to changeâ  i did not see the half sovereign given to wills cross examined  q  was wills serving in the shop at the time he gave you the half sovereign  a  yesâ  i do not know how many customers there were samuel wills  i am foreman to mr  wilcoxon in his shop in tottenham court road q  do you remember on tuesday  the 17th of march last  any boots or shoes being bought at that shop  a  i cannot charge my memory with the articleâ  the 1s  6d  taken to him was taken by me of a customer  i do not recollect who  or for what article q  did you receive a half sovereign in the course of that day  a  i can only state that from the evidence of mr  wilcoxson i must have taken itâ  i cannot trace it from my own recollectionâ  i was in the habit of making entries in the day book of goods soldâ  i have the book hereâ   producing it â  but it merely mentions the priceâ  i cannot tell who i received it fromâ  it appears from the book that i received 7s  6d   not a half sovereign john walter  i serve in mr  wilcoxon s shop in tottenham court road  and am in the habit of marking shoesâ  the figure 8 on this boot is not much unlike my 8â  i cannot say any thing about the 92â  i would not be positive the 8 is my figureâ  i see no mark on the other shoeâ  it is usual only to mark one of a pairâ  we may mark two by mistakeâ  i remember seeing a half sovereign on the counter on the 17th of marchâ  wills the foreman had itâ  i did not see who he received it fromâ  he gave it to miss wilcoxon  and she took it up stairs to her fatherâ  i do not know whether she brought any thing down henry william smith

any communication with the prisoner previous to this transactionâ  i had seen him occasionally at the office in londonâ  i had not sufficient communication with him to enable me to judge whether he

afternoonâ  the boxes were landed on monday morning  about ten o clockâ  they were the boxes referred to in the bill of lading which i brought up with me in the ship s boxâ  this is itâ   looking at no  1 â  i took the boxes on shore myself at the iron gate wharf  and put them into messrs  hartley and co  s office  on the wharf  as near as i can calculate about ten o clockâ  the wharf is close to the towerâ  between the tower and st  katherine s dockâ  i then went to the counting house of hartley and co  in john street  and saw the prisoner attending there as mr  hartley s clerkâ  i told him i had landed the boxes of specie at the wharfâ  he said he would go down and attend to it himselfâ  the boxes were in the same state when i took them there as when i received themâ  they were marked  b c 18 and 19  cross examined  q  what time did you arrive in the river  a  between three and four o clock  as near as i can calculate  on the sundayâ  i knew francis allen  a clerk in messrs  hartley s officeâ  he came on board our vessel on the sunday  about ten or twenty minutes after we arrivedâ  no other person came on board from messrs  hartley s officeâ  he did not come to me with a message from mr  hartleyâ  he had no business on board as clerk to messrs  hartleyâ  he could have none on sundayâ  he merely came on board to see me  i supposeâ  he frequently came on board ship on our arrivalâ  i knew him very wellâ  i did not know him better than any of messrs  hartley s clerksâ  i was on a friendly footing with most of themâ  the other clerks were in the habit of frequently coming on board when the ship arrivedâ  he did not make any inquiry as to what i had on boardâ  to the best of my knowledge i did not tell himâ  i might have said i had specie on board  but i think notâ  he came into the cabin to meâ  the boxes were in the room under the cabinâ  i never mentioned any thing to him about the specie  to the best of my knowledgeâ  i might have said i had specie on board  but i cannot charge my memoryâ  he might have remained down in the cabin twenty minutesâ  i was taking refreshmentâ  he came down  and might have stopped twenty minutes  bid me good day  and went awayâ  i did not see him alter he went on deckâ  he was the only person connected with messrs  hartley s establishment who came on board onsundayâ  i did not tell him i was going on shore with the specie in the morningâ  i had no conversation with him respecting the cargo  of any descriptionâ  i might have said i should he coming on shore in the morning  and might perhaps have said i should be at the wharf in the morning  but i cannot charge my memory q  do you believe you told him you were going to take the specie on shore in the morning  a  noâ  i really believe  to the best of my knowledge  i never mentioned to him  in any way  about specie being on boardâ  i believe i did not mention any thing about the boxesâ  i cannot swear itâ  the first time i saw the prisoner on the subject  was on monday morning at the office in crutched friarsâ  i have not seen allen latelyâ  i believe the last time i saw him was the latter part of aprilâ  it was the second voyage after the robberyâ  i saw him in the office at john street  and have never seen him sinceâ  i have heard that he left mr  hartley s employment very suddenly q  do not you know that he left the employment immediately on moss being in custody  a  i was not in london thenâ  i went to dublinâ  i believe moss had not been taken before i went to dublinâ  i do not know that allen went to america immediately after leaving mr  hartley s serviceâ  i know nothing about him mr  bodkin  q  what time did he go on shore after coming to see you  a  he left me between four and five o clockâ  about four o clockâ  i did not see him on board any more that dayâ  i found the boxes perfectly safe next morningâ  he had no opportunity of getting to the ship s papers to know what the cargo wasâ  the boxes were kept in a strong room under the cabin floor  which was locked  and i found it locked john martin  i am a lighterman  i remember the city of limerick steamer coming in on the 24th of march  and on the next day i took the ship s box containing the papers  to the dublin steam wharf  iron gateâ  i took it there about seven o clock in the morning  or a little after  and left it there cross examined  q  do you recollect who you saw there  a  the foreman john vince  i was a labourer at iron gate wharf  in march last  on the 25th of march i remember seeing the ship s box of the city of limerick steamer  and took it to mr  hartley s office in john street  about eight o clock in the morning  and put it on a wash hand stand there cross examined  q  did you receive it from martin  a  noâ  mr  kingston had the care of it henry moss  i am of the jewish persuasion  i know the prisoner very well indeedâ  i worked for his fatherâ  i have known the prisoner i think about seventeen or eighteen yearsâ  i was foreman to his father  and left him on being marriedâ  i was a watch maker by trade  and after i was married  the prisoner for a short time came to me to learn the watchmaking business of meâ  for about six months before the 25th of march last  i was in the habit of seeing him oftenâ  i did not exactly know what service he was inâ  i knew he had a certain engagement connected with the steam companyâ  i remember going to ellis caspar s house in finsbury pavement  about the october previous to the 25th of march lastâ  i was invited by mr  caspar to call thereâ  we went to the synagogue togetherâ  while there the prisoner came in  and we all three left the synagogue togetherâ  ellis caspar asked me in the prisoner s presence  to come and seehim  saying that he wanted meâ  i said i should call at some opportunityâ  at that time i was living at no  12  new street  mile endâ  ellis caspar knew where i lived  and on the sunday following i found him at my house when i got thereâ  the prisoner was not with himâ  he made a communication to me  in consequence of which i afterwards met him at williams s coffee house  in st  martin s le grandâ  we ultimately went to charing cross together to a coffee room thereâ  the prisoner came thereâ  there were two or three strangers in the roomâ  the prisoner said he wanted to speak to me  but not in the presence of strangersâ  we walked out together into st  james s parkâ  it was then darkâ  ellis caspar was with us  and he said to the prisoner  lewin  i have brought moss  i have not told him any thing what you wanted with him  now tell him the business â  the prisoner said he wanted me to do him a favour  that was to call at his office  and bring a letter which his father would give me  and he would give me a box  which i was to take away and give it to his fatherâ  i asked him what the box was to containâ  he said he did not know  it was to oblige a friend of his in the countryâ  he said probably stones  but it would make no difference  i should be satisfied for the trouble and loss of time i might sustainâ  i made some objection  and he said it was such business a ticket porter might do  only he did not want his father to be seen in the businessâ  he told me there could be no blame  if any  all the blame he would take on himselfâ  the prisoner told me i was to meet his father at a coffee house opposite the monument the following morningâ  he said it in his father s presence  so that he could hear itâ  i was to go there about ten o clockâ  i went  and met ellis casparâ  he said when i met him that he would go and see lewinâ  he left me to go and see for himâ  he returned in a very few minutes  and brought the prisoner with himâ  ellis caspar had a paper in his handâ  the prisoner said the ship he expected the box to come by to him had not yet arrived  and he desired me  as i had lost so much time  to go home and call again in the afternoonâ  i went again in the afternoon to the same place opposite the monumentâ  i saw ellis caspar first  and he went and fetched the prisoner  who said the ship had arrived  but two of their ships had come in collision  and there was a great deal of damage done to them  and the ship could not be unloaded  the box which was for him was at the bottom of the ship  and could not be unloaded till next morningâ  we met next morning at the same placeâ  the prisoner said he thought his friend had made a fool of him  for the box his friend had sent was too heavy for any person to carryâ  i asked him if it could not be fetched in a coachâ  he said   no   he did not wish it to be fetched in that way  as he was afraid the coachman might know his father  and he did not wish his father to be known in the businessâ  he gave me half a sovereign on that occasion  and before we separated he asked me where i could be found when he wanted meâ  he and his father walked a little way  then turned to me  and said they should not want me then  and asked me where i was to be foundâ  i said i was always to be found at my employer sâ  i was then in the service of mr  joshua hyams  a watchmaker  whose service i have been in ten yearsâ  i am not now in his house  but i work for himâ  the prisoner objected to send there for me  and asked  if i was not at home  whether i should be found if he directed a note for me  and he told me he should direct a note  not in his own nameâ  we then partedâ  we afterwards met in finsbury square  very shortly after  a few days  perhaps a day or two afterâ  the prisoner came to that meeting  and ellis caspar tooâ  we met in thesquareâ  i do not precisely recollect what passed  but i recollect it was not on the business of taking away the boxâ  it was some other businessâ  we had several meetings of no importanceâ  at one time of meeting the prisoner asked me what kind of hand i wroteâ  that was at least four months before the 25th of marchâ  i wrote my name and address on a piece of paper that the prisoner had in his pocket  and handed it to himâ  he said that would do admirably  and asked me if i would write for him two forms of letters that he would give meâ  i was to copy two forms  and give them to himâ  he lent me a letter  and said that hand writing i was to imitate as nearly as possibleâ  he lent me the letter for that purposeâ  i recollect the contents of that letter perfectlyâ  i did not return the letter to him immediately i had done what he requestedâ  i kept it by me till the day before the 25th of march  when the prisoner came to my house  i then gave it to himâ  this is the letterâ   looking at no 6 â  i mentioned my recollection of the contents of it before the magistrate  before the  letter was shown to meâ  i had a recollection of the contents of the letter  before it was shown to me before the magistrateâ  after that letter was given to me  two forms were given to me by the prisonerâ  i cannot exactly recollect when  but it was a considerable time before the transaction took place  some monthsâ  i copied them  and returned them to the prisoner  with the formsâ  i made two copies  because the first he said the ink was too pale  and the paper would not doâ  he destroyed them in my presenceâ  there were spaces left to be filled upâ  i wrote a second copy for himâ  these two letters  nos  3 and 4  are two of themâ  i wrote those two forms  but the date was not there when i wrote them  and several other words have been inserted  where i left blanksâ  they now read as perfect lettersâ  they were mere skeletons at firstâ  the date was not in  nor the words  william marsh  esq   agent to the brazilian mining co   or order  freight and charges paid  two boxes  b c  18 and 19 â  the initials and subscriptionâ  the date was not in the second letter   no  4  nor  william marsh  esq   or order  secretary to the brazilian mining company â  that is not my writing  nor the word  limerick â  i wrote  city of â  i rather think that is my writingâ  no it is notâ   city of limerick  is not my writingâ   on board  is my writingâ   w  and e  c  carne  is not mine  nor  boxes shipped by us marked b  c  18 and 19 â   mr  bristow  please deliver above  messrs  carne have advised me about them â  l  caspar   is not my writingâ  there is no address to this letterâ  when i gave it to him it was directed to l  casparâ  here is part of the  er  on it now  where it has been tornâ  i directed it to lewin casparâ  i should think it was more than a month before christmas that i did thisâ   looking at no  3 â  this is a letter directed  hartley and co   16  john street  crutched friars  london â  hat is my writingâ  i wrote that according to the formâ  i directed the other  no  4  to lewin caspar himself  by his own desire q  after this did you see any thing of lewin or ellis caspar again  before the 24th of march  a  yesâ  i only saw lewinâ  i did not see him more than twice i should think between that period and the 24th of marchâ  on the 24th of march i met ellis and lewin caspar in turner street  commercial roadâ  they were coming to my houseâ  lewin desired me to knock at the door  as he did not wish my servant to see him  and he stood on one side while the servant opened itâ  that was where i lived in new streetâ  he went there with meâ  i knocked at the door  and let them both inâ  lewin then said he should want me to morrowâ   this wassunday  the 24th of march â  i told him i had business i was obliged to transact that morning  and did not think it would be convenient for me to comeâ  ellis caspar said it would be a very good excuse to me to be out  at i told him i had out door business to do  and he said the business would not occupy many minutesâ  i agreed to meet them i think in mark laneâ  i was to meet both i supposedâ  i went to mark lane  about ten o clock next morning  and met ellis and lewin caspar together  i think in fenchurch streetâ  as i was going along  lewin caspar left his father  and ellis caspar came up to me  and said something to me  and we went together into a house in mark lane i thinkâ  he gave me a letter there  and a blue bag at the same timeâ  the letter was folded at that time  and the address was torn off as it is nowâ  i went the same day with that letter in a cab  to mr  hartley s office  in john street  and delivered it to the prisoner thereâ  this receipt  which is written across the letter  is my hand writingâ  i wrote that on it at the wharf  when i went there for the boxes  after i had been in the city about my own businessâ  i was asked to write a receipt on the letterâ  i had to deliver an order for my employer for twelve lever watches  and i received 50l  on accountâ  this is the cheque i received that morningâ   looking at no  9  â  i signed my name across it as an acknowledgment of itâ  when i received the letter from ellis caspar be told me what to do with itâ  i took it to mr  hartley s office in john street  in consequence of what he told me  and inquired for mr  hartleyâ  lewin caspar was sent out to meâ  i was in the cab thenâ  i handed him the letterâ  he went into the office  leaving me in the cabâ  he came out again with the letter i had given him  and another one which he compared togetherâ  he put his hand inside the cab with the two letters  one in each band  and examined them jury  q  how long was he before he came out  a  not above a minute or two mr  clarkson  q  did he say any thing on comparing the two letters  a  he said there was a mistake  and asked me to step out into his office  and he would correct itâ  i got out and went through the front office into the back office on the left hand sideâ  there was nobody there besides me and himâ  i observed clerks in the outer office which i passed throughâ  when we got into the inner room  the prisoner made some alteration  in one of the lettersâ  i cannot say which  nor what the alteration wasâ  the words at the bottom of this letter   mr  bristow  please deliver above  messrs  carne have advised me about them â  l  caspar   was written by the prisoner while i was in the roomâ  this is the letter  part of which i had previously written at his requestâ  he then gave me the letter to go to the wharfâ  he wrote the direction of the wharf i think on another part of the letterâ  here it is on the back   inquire for mr  bristow  dublin steam wharf  irongate â  he told me to go to the wharf  and get these things  and he should be there as soon as meâ  he told me i should have to give an acknowledgment on the letter  and told me not to write my own name  and told me some name that i was to write  but which i forgot in the interval while i had been about my own businessâ  it was in bread street that i was to deliver my master s goodsâ  i went there  and from there to the wharfâ  i got into another cab to go thereâ  i discharged the first cab somewhere by the globe insurance officeâ  i cannot precisely recollect where i took the other  but it was close on the same spotâ  i went to the wharf  and inquired for mr  hartleyâ  i think one of the porters came to me  or somebody about the officeâ  i afterwards saw mr  bristow q  why did you inquire for mr  hartley  a  i thought probably he might be at that place  though not at the other  as the clerk who first came out at john street  said   mr  hartley is not here  but the agent is â  i was in the cab when mr  bristow came out to meâ  i gave him the order the prisoner had given meâ  mr  bristow desired me to come into the officeâ  i went in and saw two boxes thereâ  mr  bristow said   these are the boxes  will you take them with you  â  the porter placed them in the cab i came by  by mr  bristow s desire  and i gave him 1s â  i then wrote this receipt on the letter  and left the letter with mr  bristowâ  i put one of the boxes into the blue bag  which ellis caspar had given meâ  it was not large enough to hold bothâ  i was desired to meet ellis caspar in wood streetâ  i went there in the cab  but he was not there when i got thereâ  i went to the cross keys public house  wood streetâ  the boxes were taken out of the cab by one of the porters there  without being directed to do so  and put on the counter  supposing i was going by one of the coachesâ  not finding ellis caspar there  i wanted to get a cord to tie the boxes together to carry them  but could not get oneâ  i got another cab  put them in  and drove to my own home near the london hospital with themâ  i drove to the london hospital  mile end road  near the corner of turner streetâ  the man by mistake drove me past the turning at which i intended to get out  which was the corner of turner street  and took me to the next street  which is at the corner of the hospitalâ  i then took out one of the boxes  and went home with it to no  12  new street  and left the other one in the cabâ  i put it in my bed roomâ  i came out with intent to fetch the other  and met ellis caspar in the streetâ  i told what i had done with one box  and where the other wasâ  in consequence of what he said to me  i got into the cab again  and was driven to the commercial road  merely to delay the timeâ  that was in a direction from my houseâ  it was to avoid my own houseâ  the box was still in the cab thenâ  i ultimately took the second box to my houseâ  i had at that time a servant named jane bradleyâ  i got out of the cab at the end of commercial road  discharged the man  and returned by the omnibusâ  i got home about eight or half past eight o clockâ  i had tea  and went to the earl st  vincent public house  which is in the neighbourhoodâ  jane bradley fetched me from thereâ  on going home i found ellis caspar waiting in the front parlour for meâ  i had a conversation with ellis caspar about the boxes  and he then told me what they containedâ  the servant did not sleep at the houseâ  she went home after some timeâ  it was very late before ellis caspar wentâ  i sent the girl home some hours before he went away  rather before the usual time  by ellis caspar s desireâ  i desired my wife to send her awayâ  there was a fire in my back parlourâ  i went up into my bed room with ellis caspar  and showed him the boxesâ  they were taken down stairs to the back parlourâ  there were seals on all four sides of each of the boxesâ  ellis caspar put the lid of one box on the fireâ  i lent him a chisel to get the cover off  that was the wooden cover  they were secured by nails merely as a packingcaseâ  after that box was opened there was a tin box enclosedâ  there was a quantity of hay between the wood and the tin q  what was the box broken for at first  a  it was by desire of ellis caspar to divide the contents into smaller portionsâ  the tin box was considerably smaller than the wooden oneâ  upon finding that  the contents were not dividedâ  there seemed then to be no necessity for itâ  the other box was opened in the same wayâ  the outside cases of both were burnt  every morsel and the hay ellis caspar took away in his handkerchiefâ  he went away before the boxes were quite burnt  and after he was gone 1 took the tin boxes up into my bed room againâ  as near as i can recollect  they were about as large as three of those octavo books   pointing to them  and about six  or eight inches longâ  i opened one of the tin boxesâ  it contained lumps of apparently ore of various coloursâ  they had no appearance of goldâ  i had never seen gold in that state beforeâ  the sizes varied very much  some were larger than othersâ  the largest was not larger than a child s fist  or a moderate sized orangeâ  i placed the boxes in my bed room that night  put them in brown paper  and tied them round with packthread  to make them appear as parcelsâ  next morning i put them into separate trunks  one into a black leather trunk of my own  and the other into a wooden trunk of my daughter s which had no lock on itâ  i corded itâ  the following morning i seat my wife to hire apartmentsâ  that was in consequence of what passed between me and ellis caspar q  well  where were the tin boxes with the ere in them afterwards taken to  a  to mansel street  by my directions  and from thence by my sisterâ  they were afterwards taken  i believe  to petticoat lane  and from thence the ore was brought to me at oxendon street  where i was then concealedâ  i had not the boxes at oxendon streetâ  the ore was taken out of the boxes before it was brought to meâ  the last time i saw the tin boxes was at my place in mansel streetâ  it was to davis s house in oxendon street that i went q  what became of you after this  a  i went to brentford for two days  and afterwards to peckham  to fishwick sâ  i never saw the prisoner after thatâ  i remained at fishwick s a fortnight  and then surrendered to the officerâ  i supplied myself with the lodging at fishwick sâ  i saw nothing of the prisoner at davis s houseâ  i did not take the ore to davis sâ  it was brought to me out of the boxesâ  i desired davis to go for it to my sister s  in petticoat laneâ  i told him they were there  and he said he should fetch themâ  i delivered up some money to the officers when i surrenderedâ  i received that money from davisâ  it was notesâ  i  think it was 140l court â  q  do you know of your own knowledge what became of the ore  a  only what i was informed ofâ  i never saw it after it was taken from oxendon streetâ  i did not receive the 140l  till nearly a fortnight afterâ  it was given to me by davis in the coach as i was coming here to surrender myselfâ  i do not know what has become of davisâ  i saw him once at the office jury â  q  did davis know you were coming to surrender  a  yes  when he gave me the 140l  he came with meâ  i came here for that purposeâ  i have been in that dock  and was afterwards dischargedâ  i do not exactly know what may be termed a dischargesâ  it was last mondayâ  i was discharged on the same day mr  clarkson â  q  do you know fiestel s coffee house  in tower street  a  yesâ  i was there with the prisoner  it night be a month before this transactionâ  i cannot state exactlyâ  i left a handkerchief thereâ   looking at a handkerchief produced by roe â  this is the one mr  jonesto mr  clarkson â  q  have you known it happen that there have been mistakes in the manifests  the bills of lading  and letters written at your house  a  i never knew such an instanceâ  i have no recollection of letters having been written to correct errors which have been made q  was your receipt of these boxes from the captain of the sea gullthe first intimation you had of it  a  we received letters the day before with the bill of lading henry mosscross examined  q  had you worked for the prisoner s father in his house  a  yesâ  i did not board thereâ  i had ceased to work for him for some time before this subject was mentioned to meâ  i had done nothing for him for many yearsâ  when i used to meet any of the family we recognised each otherâ  we were very seldom in the habit of visiting each other q  for how long before the subject was mentioned had you visited at caspar s house  a  i cannot sayâ  i sometimes called in at his shop  perhaps it might be a year before  i cannot exactly rememberâ  i know at one time mr  caspar asked me to do a job for him  when i met him by accident q  while you were in his service did you ever have to write  a  no  i had no occasion to writeâ  i never had to make out invoices  or enter in any books  nothing of the kind q  do you mean to swear up to the time you mention  lewin caspar did not know what sort of hand you wrote  a  i do not think he possibly could have knownâ  he might have seen me writing at his father sâ  i might have made some little marksâ  i cannot tell what he knew  i only know he asked me to show him what sort of hand i wroteâ  i am perfectly persuaded he could not know what sort of hand i wroteâ  he was very young when i was in his father s house  and might forget what hand i wrote  if i did write thereâ  i will swear that i do not know he knew what hand i wroteâ  i might occasionally have sent in accounts to ellis caspar in my own hand writingâ  i have no recollection of having written a letter to him since i left him  but i will not swear it q  how many different statements have you made as to the part you took in this transaction  a  i never made but one myselfâ  the statement made before was made for me  and not by meâ  the first statement  which was false  was suggested to me by davis and mrs  abrahams  when they visited me at peckhamâ  that statement was taken down in writingâ  i wrote part of it myself  and gave it to davisâ  i had some conversation with davis while i was writing itâ  davis dictated to me what i should writeâ  lewin caspar s name must have been mentioned in the course of that conversation mr  clarkson  q  did you write what davis dictated  a  yes court  q  had you any conversation which was not reduced to writing  a  i do not know what the conversation was preciselyâ  i only know that by his dictation i wrote down what i didâ  i have no hesitation in saying lewin caspar s name must have been mentioned mr  jones  q  you had conversations with davis on the whole subject  a  yesâ  i have no doubt the prisoner s name was mentioned in those conversationsâ  i have no hesitation in swearing itâ  it is impossible to swear exactly  but i believe it wasâ  i will swear  in conversation with davis  i did mention the prisoner  at that conversation when i was writing my statementâ  i was never asked that question before to dayâ  i gave that statement to davis  or mrs  abrahamsâ  they were both togetherâ  davis is my wife s father in lawâ  he married her motherâ  i do not like to own him myself  he is not quite so respectable as i could wishâ  he keeps a good many bâ  â  y housesâ  i never lived in any of themâ  i have been in one of themâ  that was in coventry courtâ  i had never been there beforeâ  i have no doubtthat was a house of that sortâ  i went from coventry court to oxendon street  a house i had never been in beforeâ  i went to coventry court on thursday morning  and left there the following tuesday morningâ  i have not seen davis since i saw him at the police officeâ  he has left the countryâ  i believe he was afraid of being taken in custody for thisâ  i was in custody myself for several monthsâ  i made a statement to mr  de mole when i surrendered myself  at the inn over the wayâ  that was the first statement i made myselfâ  that was besides the one 1 wrote at davis s dictationâ  i made a third statement while i was in prisonâ  the second statement i made  as near as i can recollect  corresponded with the first  and was equally falseâ  the third was truth  and nothing but the truth  that i know ofâ  i believe it contained what i have sworn to dayâ  it was in writingâ  i do not believe i read it over after i wrote itâ  my sister  mrs  levy  and my wife  were also taken into custody on this chargeâ  nobody else connected with me  i am quite certain q  now  when the prisoner told you he wanted you to do him a favour  did you ask him what it was about  to know if it was right or wrong  a  i did q  you would not have done what was wrong  a  if i was to assert that i should not be believed  in my present situationâ  i thought i was not doing wrong  but i scarcely expect that to be believedâ  when i went to the office i did not think i was going to steal 5000l  worth of gold dust  or i certainly would not have done it q  i suppose you have been very much surprised to find you committed a felony by it  a  it was a surprise at firstâ  i have not got over it now  i shall never get over it  my feelings are too much hurt by itâ  i wore the same coat i have on now when i went to the officeâ  i was dressed very similar to what i am nowâ  my whiskers were in just the same stateâ  i never saw the prisoner after that day that i saw him at the office  except in custody q  what have you been doing with yourself since the last trial  a  employed at my businessâ  i live now at no  126  cornwall road  lambethâ  my business is carried on thereâ  i work in the front roomâ  it is a private house  with railings in frontâ  i am a housekeeper thereâ  i set up housekeeping the quarter before lastâ  i had no communication with mr  hartley s solicitor  till after i heard the result of the investigation which took place after the last trialâ  i then read it in the newspaperâ  i have had a communication with mr  hartley s solicitor  since the last trialâ  i was desired to go to know if i should be wanted  and told them where to find meâ   looking at no  3 â  i do not know in whose hand writing this  w  marsh  esq   isâ  it is not mineâ  all my family have been liberated as well as myselfâ  my object in giving my last statement was certainly to effect that purpose q  did you know allen  a clerk at  messrs  hartley s  a  no  i never saw him to my knowledgeâ  i never had any acquaintance with any body of that nameâ  i have no recollection of any such person living in my neighbourhoodâ  i will swear i have no acquaintance of that nameâ  i do not know a person named mitchellâ  i have heard the nameâ  i never had any acquaintance of that nameâ  the hay that was found in the boxes was taken away by ellis caspar in his pocket handkerchief  and the wooden boxes were burntâ  he did not appear to take great care of the hay q  why not suggest to him it would be better to burn it  a  theblaze might have set the chimney on fireâ  i do not know that that reason was assigned  but it would have that effectâ  there was a good large pocket handkerchief fullâ  no means were attempted to burn itâ  it might have been burnt certainly mr  clarkson  q  you have been asked whether you wrote the direction of no  3   william marsh  esq  â  did you know there was such a person in existence  a  i never heard of such a nameâ  i never heard of a person named allen living near meâ  i had not the most distant idea that mr  hartley had a servant or clerk of that nameâ  i did not know any of the clerks or servants except the prisonerâ  i read in the newspaper the decision of the judges on the last trialâ  i went to mr  hartley in consequence of his sending his porterâ  mr  hartley told me to call on mr  de mole  to see if he wanted meâ  he sent me to mr  humphreys  who said he would send me a subpoena when i was wantedâ  i have always been willing since the last trial to state what i knew of the transactionâ  i do not know whether ellis caspar took away all the hay which was in the boxes  some might have been leftâ  i was never charged with any offence in my life until this circumstanceâ  i conducted mr  hyam s whole business for more than ten years  and am in his service nowâ  davis is one of the persons indicted as isaac isaacsâ  he has run away q  you have made a statement respecting the ore at his house in oxenden street  was that part of the statement you were prepared to make before davis ran away  a  certainly notâ  i was to have screened himâ  it was at his dictation i made the statement  to screen him  and when he found i made the statement before the magistrate which i did  he ran away q  what time on sunday  the 24th of march  was it that the two caspars came to your house  a  i have no doubt it was between one and two o clockâ  that was the usual time i used to go home to dinner  and i met them in the streetâ  none of my family were ever brought to trialâ  i remember ellis caspar being in difficultiesâ  i proved under his bankruptcy as a creditorâ  i have the bill now in my pocketâ  i dare say i had a dozen meetings with the caspars before the proposition to copy these forma was made to meâ  there were several meetings at different timesâ  the original proposition was about another parcel called stones court  q  you say you thought you were not doing wrong when you went to the office  when did you first have reason to know you were doing wrong  a  the same evening ellis caspar came to my house  and told me the nature of the business i had been engaged inâ  he then told me there was gold in itâ  i knew it was something intended to be kept secret  but i had no knowledge of it being a robberyâ  i knew false papers were made out  and that i obtained the articles  in a false nameâ  it was given to me by the prisoner s directionâ  i knew i was lending myself to something not entirely correct  but supposing the prisoner to be a respectable young man  and knowing his father  i did not suppose a robbery was committed q  when you were shifting cabs  and taking things in an omnibus  and by false letters getting goods by false names  did not you know you were lending yourself to a false transaction  a  i did not get the letters milled upâ  i carried a letter which was originally written by myself  but i had not read itâ  it was folded  and i never opened it q  he came to the cab with you  and compared the letters  said therewas something wrong  showed the paper to you  told you to assume a false name  and to go and get the goods  a  i was not aware of it being a theft  however strange the circumstance may appearâ  i mean to assert thatâ  the prisoner told me i might depend on him  he would take all the blame if any body could blame him  as he was the principal in the concern  and i had nothing to fearâ  i thought it was samething of smuggling  i admit  but further than that i did not thinkâ  i knew it was gold the same night  ellis caspar told me so jury  q  you knew it was valuable property before  a  i never was given to understand so q  why put it in your bed room  a  because i had no mote convenient placeâ  it was a very snail place i lived in  and the back parlour used by my wife was very smallâ  i had no motive in carrying it up stairs but putting it out of the wayâ  i have not said it was for security court  q  when you burnt the lid what did you think  a  then i knew all about it  i had been toldâ  i have sot charged any person who had no share with me in the transactionâ  my false statement were only to screen the guiltyâ  that was mrs  abrahams and davisâ  i have not falsely charged any one with the crimeâ  i never made any but the present statement on oath henry mitchell  i am a messenger at mr  hartley s office is john street  on the 25th of march i saw the witness john vince with the city of limerick s ship s box  containing the papersâ  i saw him lay it on the wash band standâ  i saw the prisoner that morning about eight o clockâ  he just walked through the warehouse into his own office as i supposed  and went out again  saying he would be in in a short timeâ  i received the ship s box while he was outâ  he came back and opened the box as it stood there  and took papers outâ  he generally came to the office about nine o clock  but this morning he came about eightâ  it might be a few minutes sooner or laterâ  i went for the letters that morning to a receiving house in the minorie s  and got the letters  which i brought to the office and delivered to the clerk  william blundell  who took an account of them  about twenty minutes or a quarter to ten o clockâ  he remained in the office  and took an account of the lettersâ  the prisoner was standing at his desk at the same time  and took part of the letters out of blundell s handsâ  i then went to breakfastâ  both the prisoner and blundell stretched out their hands at the same time to receive the letters  but i gave then to blundell  and he opened themâ  they were tied in a stringâ  he was commencing to take the account  and while he was doing so  the prisoner took part of themâ  i went to breakfast  leaving blundell taking the accountâ  i returned at near ten o clock  and met the prisoner coming down stairsâ  he sent me down to the wharf with a letter to give to mr  bristow  the wharfinger  and told me to tell mr  bristow  or any of the clerks there  not to let any of the specie off the wharf till he himself came downâ  i went to the wharf but did not see mr  bristowâ  i saw feltham and the foreman of the wharf  and delivered the messageâ  i then returned to the prisonerâ  i was sent down to the wharf againâ  i then saw mr  bristow at the wharf  and delivered the former message to himâ  i then returned to the prisoner  and found mossâ   looking at him â  with him in the prisoner s office  which was the back roomâ  they did not remain many minutes after i came inâ  they both walked out of the back office through the warehouse  and went outâ  moss got into a cabâ  the prisoner remained behind  shut the door  and went to his room cross examined  q  is it not a common thing to send you down to thewharf with a message  a  yes  every dayâ  i am there for the purposeâ  i am not aware that he ever sent me with such a message before  not to let things go till he cameâ  his orders were generally in writing  sometimes verbalâ  he has not sent me with such messages before to my knowledgeâ  i will not swear he has notâ  he was there about eight o clock that morning  a few minutes before or afterâ  it was before i had any thing but the office open and the floor sprinkled to be sweptâ  seven o clock is the hour it opensâ  i will swear he was there before nine o clock that morningâ  there is a time piece in the office q  what is the earliest hour you have known him at the office  a  i have seen him between seven and eight o clock when a vessel has been sailing at six o clock  but that was very seldomâ  i believe he has sometimes slept on board a vessel on such occasions  as i have taken notes to his mother s house on those occasionsâ  i cannot say he slept on boardâ  i have heard soâ  he had his breakfast at the office those morningsâ  he might have had his breakfast at the office on other mornings besides those on which vessels sailed  but put it altogether i do not suppose i have brought him half a dozen breakfasts since i have been thereâ  i cannot say whether they were all shipping morningsâ  i have been nearly eight years in the employâ  i should say the prisoner has been in the office between two and three years  but at the time he joined the concern i belonged to the west end officeâ  i should say we have both been in the same office about two yearsâ  i am not aware thatâ  he has breakfasted there with mr  hartleyâ  he mightâ  mr  hartley did sleep there sometimesâ  i have not teen the prisoner breakfast with him q  who else was at the office that morning at eight o clock  a  the next clerk that came was allenâ  he came about half past eight  as near as i can sayâ  and another came  i should say  at nine o clockâ  i believe that was mr  blundell  but i had gone for the letters about a quarter before nine  as there was a clerk in the placeâ  it was a grocer s shop where i went to for the lettersâ  the people generally meet there to get their lettersâ  moss is the person who came to the office that morningâ  i persist in swearing thatâ  i gave a description of the person on the last trialâ  i dare say i stated then that the man had sandy whiskersâ  i didâ  i said large bushy whiskers q  do you call moss a person with large bushy sandy whiskers  a  undoubtedly not at presentâ  his whiskers are not in the same state as they were when he came to the officeâ  i believe i described his whiskers as meeting close to the chinâ  to the best of my opinion they were falseâ  they were never the natural growth of his faceâ  they were sandy at that time  to the best of my opinionâ  i am not aware that i gave that description to roe and leaâ  when brought to lambeth street i described them as i have nowâ  i do not call them sandy nowâ  i am not aware that i gave a description of the man to roe and leaâ  i will not swear that i didâ  i did not  to my knowledge  swear on the last trial that i had given a description to one of the officersâ  to the best of my opinion  i did notâ  i am not aware that i gave that description to one of the officers  but i will not swear to any thing i am not conscious ofâ  i did not  to my knowledge  give any such description either to roe or leaâ  i cannot answer in any other wayâ  i cannot say what age the man who came to the office appeared to beâ  he seemed to me to be a middle aged man  a man that had a halt in his walkâ  as he walked out of the warehouse heappeared lameâ  he walked in that wayâ  i might have said  he appeared to be a man about sixty years of ageâ  i do not think i said sixty on the last trialâ  it is so long ago i might be wrong if i swore i did notâ  to the best of my opinion  i did notâ  i never  to my knowledge  described the man as appearing about sixty years of ageâ  i only swear to the best of my opinion q  did he appear about sixty  a  he walked with his bead downâ  it is hard to describe what age he might beâ  i took him to be in the middle age of lifeâ  i should say fifty was nearer the markâ  when a man is sixty he is going down hillâ  i did not take notice whether allen was in the office or not at the time the man came q  how soon after the robbery did allen leave mr  hartley s office  a  to the best of my opinion  he left on whit monday  seven weeks after the robberyâ  i might have said on the last trial that he left a fortnight or three weeks after the robbery  but i have found out since if i did say so i have said wrongâ  i remember seeing moss in custody at lambeth streetâ  i do not know when moss was first taken  but i know allen was in mr  hartley s employ  and left about whit mondayâ  i should say moss had been examined before thatâ  allen did live in commercial road  but i rather think  about the time of the robbery he lived in a street opposite the wharf  burr street or somethingâ  i cannot say when he moved thereâ  i do not know what has become of himâ  i have not heard whether he is living or deadâ  i should say he left the office very suddenlyâ  he was at business the saturday before  and did not make his appearance on mondayâ  i have stated that he elopedâ  those were the words i made use ofâ  i did not notice whether the man who came to the office had a velvet collar to his coat or not  at the time i saw moss first he was leaning both his arms on the deskâ  i had only a side glance at himâ  i have not described him as having a velvet collar  to my knowledgeâ  the prisoner superintended the business when mr  hartley was out of townâ  as far as i have seen  he appeared very zealous and industriousâ  i described the man as between five feet eight and nineâ  i never described him as six feet high mr  doane  q  on the mornings when the prisoner occasionally came before nine o clock  it was when vessels were to sail early  a  those mornings in particularâ  no vessel sailed early on the morning in questionâ  there was no reason  that i know of  for his coming before nine o clock q  you are not sure whether allen was in the office when most came  can you say whether you are sure that most was with allen or with the prisoner  a  i swear the prisoner and moss were both together  and moss took the cab  and the prisoner waved  his hand to himâ  i am positive moss is the man william blundell  on the 25th of march i was a clerk in mr  hartley s officeâ  i was in the counting house that morning  when the general post letters were deliveredâ  the prisoner was thereâ  i received the letters a little before ten o clock from mitchellâ  i keep a book  in which i enter the account of postageâ  i have it with me nowâ  i made an entry that morning in the book  and altered it after i made itâ  the first entry was one falmouth  two plymouth  and four dublin letters  which  according to my reckoning  came to 7s  10d â  the prisoner took part of the letters from me  opened them  and returned them to me  and when he returned them to me there were two falmouth lettersâ  the postage of aletter from falmouth  at that time  was 1s â  it was the custom of the postman to put the amount of the letters on the back of one of them  and he had done so that morningâ  there was 1s  difference between his amount and mineâ  that would be the difference of one falmouth letterâ  i put down the amount of the letters in my book  after i received them from lewin caspar  and my account was 1s  more than the postman sâ  the postman s entry on the letters was 1s  10d â  it if our custom to settle with the general postman once a weekâ  when i paid him that week i paid him for one falmouth letterâ  the letters were taken into the office that morning by lewin casparâ  about eleven o clock that morning i was called out to see somebodyâ  i went out  and saw a cab and a man in itâ   looking at the witness moss â  that is the manâ  he asked for mr  hartleyâ  i told him that mr  hartley was not in town  but that mr  caspar  his agent  would see himâ  i went in and called the prisonerâ  he went out to the cab  and they both came through the outer office  and went into the inner officeâ  they remained there a few minutesâ  they both came out together  caspar opening the door for mossâ  but before they came out the prisoner came from the inner office to me  and asked me whether there were two boxes of gold dust marked  b  c  18 and 19   consigned to the brazilian a companyâ  i told him there wasâ  i looked into the book to examine before i told himâ  moss went away in the cabâ  the prisoner went out of the office into the street with himâ  i saw the prisoner again at two o clock that day  and he told me that a robbery had been committedâ  he said nothing else that i am aware of  nothing about the letters that i am aware ofâ  i cannot say that the word  forgery  was mentioned cross examined  q  it would be caspar s duty to open all letters that came there in the absence of mr  hartley  a  yesâ  i received the letters from mitchellâ  i entered part of them in the book immediatelyâ  i bad entered part of them when caspar took some of them upâ  i entered them all before he took them away into the back officeâ  it was not after his return from the back office that i discovered there was an extra letter  it was while he was standing at the deskâ  i was entering them when he took themâ  i had entered one falmouth letter before he took them from meâ  i suppose he saw me do itâ  he was standing at the desk at the time  close to meâ  he knew it was my custom to enter letters in the book as soon as they came q  when you received the letters back from caspar  and saw two falmouth letters instead of one  did you mention it to him  a  i told him there was 1s  difference in the postageâ  i did not make any observation about the difference in the lettersâ  i did not tell him there was one falmouth letter more than i had given to himâ  i did not think it was requisiteâ  i immediately made the alterationâ  he did not say any thing particular when i told him there was 1s  difference in the lettersâ  he had nothing to do with the payment of the pottage  any more than to see that it was correctâ  i went to the office at nine o clock that morningâ  several of the clerks were there when i got thereâ  i believe francis allen was thereâ  mitchell had gone for the lettersâ  i paid the postman  at the end of the week  25s  6d   and 1s  10d  for that morning q  now you say moss is the person who came there  did he present the same appearance then that he does now  a  no  he had large black whiskers  not unusually largeâ  they were large whiskersâ  they were so large that they attracted my particular attentionâ  very differentfrom what he appears nowâ  i did not observe what age he appeared to be exactlyâ  i am not aware that i have ever said he was a man of fifty or sixty years of ageâ  i do not remember that i said on the last trial  he was a man between fifty and sixty years of ageâ  i might have said so  but i cannot say  it is so long sinceâ  i think i heard mitchell say he was about sixtyâ  i cannot say whether i swore that at the last trial or notâ  i believe i didâ  the person stooped as he walked  i should say  from infirmity or ageâ  i think i said  last time  that he was from five to six feet high  leaving plenty of room for guessingâ  i did not say he was about five feet seven inchesâ  caspar was not at the office when i got there at nine o clockâ  it was after nine o clock when i first saw him that morningâ  i cannot say whether it was as late as half pastâ  i should say it was between nine and half past nine o clockâ  nine o clock was my usual time for going to the officeâ  i believe caspar very often went earlier than thatâ  it was necessary for businessâ  i have seen nothing of moss since  the last trial  only about here the last day or twoâ  not at the office  or anywhere elseâ  i am not aware of any mistakes in letters from correspondents at falmouth with regard to goods consignedâ  mistakes have happenedâ  goods have been entered on the manifest  and have not arrived  and letters hare occasionally been written to correct the errorsâ  i have known letters from messrs  carne correcting errors made in previous communicationsâ  that has sometimes happenedâ  i do not know that it has not frequently happenedâ  i have not been in the habit of reading the lettersâ  i have heard of such things in the officeâ  i think allen was in the office when i got there that morningâ  i cannot say positivelyâ  he remained in the office six or seven weeks i think afterwardsâ  i do not exactly remember the time moss was taken into custodyâ  i do not know that allen went off very suddenlyâ  i know it was talked of that be ran away  that be went awayâ  i think moss was taken about four or five weeks afterwardsâ  i do not remember whether it was about the same time that allen leftâ  i believe it wasâ  i do not know that allen has run away to americaâ  i do not know whether he it living or deadâ  i have not heard q  were the papers in the office open as much to allen and the other clerks as they were to caspar  a  no  not private lettersâ  letters of any importance were not open to any one who liked to read them q  but could not any other clerk in the office  if so disposed  read any of them  a  no  because they were always looked up  i believeâ  i dare say i could have read them if they were lying aboutâ  i cannot say where the keys were kept  unless caspar kept themâ  i am not aware that they hung up in the officeâ  i never knew of their being kept in the officeâ  allen was collecting clerkâ  he was occasionally in the habit of going on board steam vessels  and to the wharfâ  there are two cupboards in the office  in which boxes of letters were keptâ  letters received in the morning from correspondents would be put in the cupboardâ  it was not locked â  i believe any clerk in the office could have gone and looked at themâ  i have no doubt of it q  was it not matter of public talk and notoriety that allen had run away  a  not that i am aware ofâ  it was talked of in the office that he had gone away  and had not been seen since  but not that he had run awayâ  i am not aware that any inquiries have been made about himâ  i have never seen him since mr  clarkson  q  whose business was it to take care of letters andsuperintend the business of the office in the absence of mr  hartley  a  caspar sâ  it was his duty to take charge of letters  to read  and answer themâ  no other person in the office had any right to read private communications made to mr  hartley but the prisonerâ  i believe i was asked nearly all these questions about allen on the former trialâ  there have been letters from messrs  came correcting communications of the delivery of goodsâ  caspar would know that  and would know how the absence of goods might be accounted forâ  i did not get to the office till nine o clockâ  whether caspar was there before that  or what he had been doing between eight and nine o clock  i do not knowâ  at the time i spoke to caspar about the postage  i had no idea that one of those letters was a forgery  nor that the post mark had been forged  or that any fraud had been committed or contemplatedâ  i supposed it was a mistake of my own  and altered itâ  allen went away about six or seven weeks after this transactionâ  i do not know when moss was taken jury  q  on the 25th  when the letters arrived  was it possible that any one besides the prisoner could have seen them previous to the arrival of moss  a  if they were laid on the desk  and no one was in the office  any one could walk in and see themâ  they did not lay there that i know of q  from the time you received the letters from mitchell till you saw moss there  was it possible for any one but the prisoner to see those letters  a  no court  q  what time did you see moss come  a  nearly eleven o clock  and the post arrived about a quarter before tenâ  the prisoner was present when mitchell delivered the letters to meâ  i delivered over to the prisoner all the letters i receivedâ  several other clerks were in the office when mitchell delivered the letters to me  but nobody handled them but i and the prisonerâ  he had taken some letters from me before i made the entry complete in the book thomas kingston  i am foreman at iron gate wharf  on the 25th of march  i remember a person coming there in a cab  about twelve o clockâ   looking at moss â  that is the manâ  he asked me if the agent was inâ  i told him he was not in town  but the wharfinger was at homeâ  he mentioned mr  bristow by name  and desired me to call him outâ  i called him out  and he came out to him  went to the cab  and they spoke togetherâ  moss then came out of the cab into the counting house with mr  bristowâ  he was there about two minutes  and came outâ  i brought out one box and another man another  by mr  bristow s desireâ  mr  bristow told me to put those boxes into the cab  which i didâ  they were marked  b  c  18 and 19 â  moss gave me a shilling and drove away in the cab with the two boxesâ  i had seen the prisoner in the counting house that morning  about an hour before moss came cross examined  q  are you quite sure moss is the man  a  i am i have no doubt of it whateverâ  i never said i had a doubtâ  he had larger whiskers then  and he looks fatter now than he did then  in my opinionâ  his whiskers were a size larger than now  as large as mineâ  i call mine larger than his  middling sizedâ  they were black  i am certain  quite blackâ  i saw him next at lambeth street  about three weeks or a month afterwards  and i knew him at onceâ  i knew allen very wellâ  i did not see him in the course of that day  to my recollectionâ  he ran away from mr  hartley sâ  every body knew thatâ  he ran away i believe  about the beginning of mayâ  the  first time i saw moss at lambeth street was about april  i thinkâ  i cannot say whether it was about the same time as allen ran awayâ  it was not a great while edward bristow  i am chief clerk at iron gate wharf  on the 25th of march last i remember seeing the prisoner at the wharf  between ten and eleven o clock in the morningâ  i was in the counting houseâ  he brought a letter with himâ   looking at no  3 â  this is itâ  he threw it on the desk  and said he had received it that morning from messrs  carne  to deliver two boxes  marked  b c 18   19   to a gentleman who would produce a letter from themâ  he said he had given an order at the foot of the letter for me to give them to him  no

told me to deliver them to the gentleman on the production of the orderâ  i asked him bow long he thought the gentleman would be before he cameâ  he said he expected he would have been there before himâ  i wished him to stay and see them deliveredâ  i was aware they contained large property  by the statement on the manifest  which made me wish him to stopâ  he said he would stayâ  he remained about half an hourâ  he then went away with other packages  which he had  to the bank of englandâ  the expected gentleman came  i should think  rather more than half an hour after the prisoner leftâ  kingston  the foreman  informed me of his arrivalâ  i went out  found a cab there  and a person in itâ  it was mossâ  i saw the letter in his hand  with the order of the prisoner at the footâ  he showed it to meâ  this is itâ   looking at no  4 â  i believe the order at the bottom to be in the hand writing of the prisoner  and also this memorandum endorsed upon itâ  i have often seen him write no  4  read   the back of which was torn off â  falmouth post mark   23rd march â  london post mark   25th march    falmouth  23rd march  1839  messrs  wm  marsh  esq   or order  secy  to brazn

shown to you by moss  did you do what the prisoner told you  deliver the boxes  a  yesâ  i got a receipt for themwhich moss wrote across the letterâ  this is it   recd  the above  j  h  dean  per marsh  esq  â  he drove away with the boxes cross examined  q  was the prisoner  in the absence of mr  hartley  generally very much engaged in business  a  yesâ  i do not consider that he had any time to throw awayâ  i did not consider it extraordinary that he should go away after waiting half an hourâ  he had the whole business to attend to in mr  hartley s absenceâ  i first heard there had been a robbery about two o clock in the afternoonâ  the prisoner was not the first person to tell meâ  kingston didâ  i saw the prisoner about three o clock in the afternoon  he then told me of itâ  i was examined at lambeth street q  from first to last did not the prisoner evince every anxiety to exert himself to the utmost to discover the perpetrators of the robbery  a  he certainly appeared very much excited about itâ  he expressed himself anxious that the perpetrators should be brought to justiceâ  he never absented himself from the office to my knowledgeâ  i have known him about four yearsâ  i never heard any thing but the highest character of himâ  he was always considered clever in businessâ  i do not know that mistakes were occasionally made at the officeâ  my duty is at the wharfâ  i have known some packages over  which were not in the manifest  and some packages in the manifest  not in the vessel q  in different matters were there not mistakes occurring almost every day of some sort or other  a  there might be slight errorsâ  i never heard of any serious onesâ  i was shown this letter  no  4  by the prisoner  in lea s presence  on the afternoon the robbery was committedâ  i believed the signature of messrs  came to it  to be genuineâ  i have seen messrs  carne s signature occasionally  and believed it to be genuine q  have you known the prisoner very often at the wharf early of a morning  a  no  not very earlyâ  i have seen him there at eight o clock when he had occasion to go on board a vessel that was going to sail  but not on other occasionsâ  i never recollect itâ  i will undertake to say i never did see him unless a vessel was sailingâ  i have seen him at the office as early as eight o clock q  is that the sort of direction the prisoner would write as an order to deliver goods  a  yes  when he had occasion to do soâ  i should have delivered a package without the order under it  but not such valuable propertyâ  if i saw the letter  believing it to be  signed by messrs  carne  i should have delivered itâ  believing it to be genuine  i should have delivered the goodsâ  i knew allenâ  i did not see him at the wharf that day  i am certainâ  he might be at the wharf once or twice a weekâ  i remember his leaving suddenlyâ  i do not know why he left  nor whether he is living or deadâ  i have never seen him sinceâ  i have never had any doubt about moss being the person who came to the wharfâ  i did not hear mitchell describe himâ  i remember bills being put up advertising the robberyâ  communications from falmouth of consignments would be by post advising of them q  did such advice generally arrive the day before the goods  a  it depended on the passage the vessel hadâ  this vessel left  i think  in time to be up on sunday  but the letters could not be delivered until mondayâ  nobody in mr  hartley s establishment could know that the gold was comingâ  the writing of this letter   no  4   is different to any writing i ever saw from messrs  carne s office  except the signatureâ  it is very different to the prisoner s hand writingâ  i should not consider any part of it like his  except the order and endorsement mr  bodkin  q  you remember the prisoner at the wharf at eight o clock  when vessels have been startingâ  were any starting this morning  a  noâ  these boxes corresponded in every respect with the manifest william debonnaire haggard  i am chief clerk in the bullion office at the bank of england  on the 25th of march i did not receive two boxes of gold dustâ  i expected two  from a letter i received from falmouth for the brazilian company james peat  i am accountant to the brazilian company  i went to the office of the company on the 25th of march  about ten o clockâ  no boxes of gold dust marked b c 18 and 19 arrived at the officeâ  we expected such boxesâ  william march is our secretaryâ  he came to the office about eleven o clockâ  in consequence of a communication from him  i sent carthew to the dublin steam packet wharfâ  i was at the bullion office in the bank about one o clock  when the prisoner came thereâ  i went to inquire if the boxes had arrived  and saw the prisoner thereâ  i asked him what had become of oar two boxes of gold dust  marked b c 18 and 19â  he said   they have been delivered at your house â  i said   how is that  when they are consigned by the bill of lading to the bank of england  â  he said   we have this morning received a letter from messrs  carne  stating  that in consequence of an error in the manifest  they were not to be delivered at the bank of england  but to the agent of the brazilian company â  i asked him the name of the agentâ  he said he could not recollect  but if i would go with him to the office  in crutched friars  he would tell me the nameâ  i asked him if the name was marchâ  he said   that  i think  is the name â  i then left the bank  and left himâ  i went to our office  and ascertained that the boxes were not delivered thereâ  i then went to the office in crutched friars  and saw the prisoner in the outer officeâ  i said   these boxes have not been delivered at our office  where are they  â  he said   if you will walk into the inner office  i will tell you what has become of them â  he produced two letters to meâ   looking at nos  3 and 4 â  these are thenâ  no  4 was exactly in the same state then as it is now  with the address torn offâ  i asked him   what has become of the outside of this letter  the address  â  he said   i don t know whether it was torn off when it was first delivered into my hands  or whether it was torn off since â  he did not tell me whether he knew who it had been addressed toâ  he asked me if i thought the signatures of messrs  carne were genuineâ  i told him i thought notâ  he said   are they not like messrs  carnes  writing  â  i said   certainly  i think they are like it  but i think they are not genuine  i think they are forged â  i asked him if the body of the letter was written in a similar hand to any body in messrs  carnes  house that he was in the habit of seeingâ  if it was similar to any writing he had seen coming from messrs  carnes  houseâ  he said  certainly it was  he had seen such writing oftenâ  he did not tell me whose writing it was cross examined  q  did you ask him if the boxes had been delivered  a  he told roe they had been delivered that morning to a gentlemanly looking man  either representing himself as coming from william march  or william march himself  he could not tell whichâ  he said he thought the letters genuine  and he had seen similar writing from carnes  houseâ  i am acquainted with messrs  carnes  writingâ  it is in some degree similarâ  i mean the signature  but  in my opinion  easily detected to be a forgery q  suppose a person received it in the hurry of business  do not you think he might be deceived by it  a  it is possibleâ   looking at no  3 â  there is nothing particularly extraordinary in this letterâ  i should say  on looking at it  it is not what i consider exactly a mercantile letterâ  in the first place  it is addressed at foot  w  marsh  esq   agent to the brazilian mining company  or order   now mr  march s name is spelt wrong  and he is not agent  but secretary to the companyâ   looking at no  4 â  this is decidedly much more unmercantile than the other  because it is addressed  messrs  w  marsh  esqr  â  the signature is somewhat similar to messrs  carnes â  it is a signature i would not act on q  but a person reading it over once may very likely not be able to distinguish it from a genuine signature  a  it is possible  i cannot say it is probable i confessâ  i am not at all acquainted with the hand writing of the prisonerâ  i should say the note at the bottom of no  8  is a different hand writing from the body  and the date also   23rd of march  1839  i should say was differentâ  all the rest appears to be one hand writing  except the note at the bottom  and the signatureâ  i do not think the date is a similar hand writing to the body  generallyâ  i think it is a different hand writingâ  i think the date of no  4  and  messrs  w  marsh  esq   secretary to the brazilian mining company  or order   is different to the body q  in your judgment  could such an error as that be made by a person competent to conduct mr  hartley s business  a  certainly notâ  nor any person in the habit of correspondingâ   messrs   is in the same line with the name  and appears in the same hand writing as the rest of the address  and it appears to be squeezed into a place not large enough mr  clarkson  q  look at the words   city of limerick  tell me whether that is the same hand writing as the body  a  i think notâ  i think the  18 and 19  appear the same kind of figures as the date  1839  q  can you perceive any difference in the writing and ink of the word  messrs    in the corner  and the name which follows  a  it appears to me it is all written with the same inkâ  the word  messrs   is written rather larger than the rest of the nameâ  it is the same as  w  marsh   c   in my opinion william march  i am secretary to the brazilian company  mr  george haythorn is one of the proprietors of that companyâ  there are other proprietors besides himâ  on the 20th of march we had advice of the arrival of some gold dust from the brazils  by a letter from messrs  carne  of falmouthâ  it was advice of two boxes of gold dust   18 and 19   weighing 102 lbs  10oz  11 dwts   by the sea gull  they were forwarded by the city of limerick steam packet q  when would it be known in london among persons conversant with shipping  that the sea gull had arrived  a  on the 20th  the day we received the adviceâ  on the 25th of march i received further advice of their being shipped  by the city of limerick steamerâ  a bill of lading was enclosed with the advice  which i thought i had here  but i find i have made a mistake  and brought the wrong oneâ  i never authorised moss  or any other person to go to iron gate wharf  to receive those boxesâ  i had no idea of such a proceeding being taken  no  1   being read  was the bill of lading of the city of limerick  in which was  two boxes of gold dust  marked b  c  18 and 19   containing together 1021bs  10oz  11 dwts  troy  consigned to the brazilian company at the bank of england no  2  was the extract from the manifest of the city of limerick   as in page 686  no  6   read â   messrs  jas  hartley and co   16 john street  crutched friars  falmouth  oct  8  1838  gentlemen â  we are in receipt of your note of the 6th instant  and in reply  we beg to say the turtle it for mr  haggard  at the bullion office  bank of englandâ  the duke of cambridge arrived at noonâ  all well  we are  gentlemen  your obedient servants  w  and e c  carne  per geo  hugoe  p s  we wrote you last night  per box  informing you we received the chest of tea  which shall be returned  mr  bristow  please attend to this â  l  caspar  william marchcontinued  i never saw this letter  no  4   till after the robbery was effectedâ  that is not written at all in a mercantile style  quite unbusiness like q  would you  as a man of business  act on the receipt of that letter  a  certainly not  not purporting to come from a respectable house like carnes â  this letter  no  3   is not  in my judgment  a mercantile business like letterâ  a person conversant with mercantile affairs would not act on such a letter  i should sayâ  it is not quite so informal as the other  but my name is improperly spelt  and the firm it mentioned in the body of the letter  and at the bottom it says   w  marsh  esq   agent â  messrs  carne are aware of the way to spell my name  and are constantly in the habit of writing to me  and they know i am not agent to the company  but secretary cross examined  q  you received the first intimation of the consignment of gold dust on the 20th of march  a  yesâ  i did not make that communication publicâ  it does not go beyond the directors of our own company  and persons connected with the companyâ  i might mention it to themâ  i had no communication with the prisoner on the subject  nor with any body in mr  hartley s office q  although it would be known to shipping people on the 20th  that the sea gull had arrived  would it be known to them what the cargo consisted of  a  it is very likelyâ  it is often mentioned in the newspaper if there is specie on board q  in your judgment  would any one conversant with mercantile matters  intending to commit a fraud  write such letters as these  a  it is difficult to say  a person well acquainted with business  i should say  hardly wouldâ  i did not know the prisoner before this  the record of the conviction of moss was here produced and read   adjourned  saturday  march 7th  1840 james hartley  i carry on the business of a wharfinger and proprietor of steam vessels  with others  under the firm of james hartley and co   i am the prosecutor of this indictment  on the 25th of march i was in dublinâ  i came to london on the night of the 28thâ  the prisoner was in my service  and had at the rate of 150l  a yearâ  in february  last year  he applied to me for an increase of salary  which i declinedâ  on the 21st of march  last year  i had occasion to write to the prisonerâ  this is the letter i wrote to him  no  7 â  this letter of the 26th of march  no  5  is in the prisoner s hand writingâ  that letter was never sentâ  allen was in my employâ  he quitted my employ on the 13th of may lastâ  moss was taken into custody about the middle of aprilâ  i have not the most remote reason to believe that allen was concerned in this transaction cross examined  q  he was a clerk in your employ  the same as the prisoner  but in a subordinate situation  a  yesâ  he had a salary as the restâ  i had no notice whatever of his going awayâ  the last i saw of him was on saturday evening  when i sent him to the bank with lodgmentsâ  i have not seen him sinceâ  i have heard from his brother that he went to montreal  and is deadâ  i did not learn when he wentâ  i could have his brother here in a few minutesâ  i had the highest opinion of the prisoner s integrity  or i would not have left my business in his handsâ  a good deal of specie came to the bank  which he had to superintend the delivery of q  there was at one time 90 000  at another 10 000 guineas in one parcel  a  i do not recollect that  but very large sums passed through his handsâ  moss surrendered himself in aprilâ  allen lodged in burr street  lower east smithfield  the latter part of the time he was with meâ  i do not know whether he lived in commercial road before thatâ  i do not know whether the prisoner was in the habit of sleeping on board vessels at timesâ  i have seen him at my office early on shipping mornings  between seven and eight o clockâ  i think he might be there on other mornings sometimes as early as eight o clock mr  clarkson  q  allen filled quite a subordinate situation to the prisoner  a  yesâ  he had nothing to do with the letters or giving orders about bills of lading  or any thing  till they had gone through the prisoner s hands george carthew  i am in the service of the brazilian company  on the 25th of march  last year  i was sent to mr  hartley s office  in john street  and saw a clerk thereâ  i believe the prisoner to be the person  but i cannot swear to himâ  i inquired if two boxes of gold dust had arrived by their vessel  from falmouth  on the brazilian company s accountâ  he answered   yes â  this was about eleven o clock in the morningâ  mr  peat had sent meâ  i should think it was rather after eleven o clock than beforeâ  i think i might be certain it was before twelve o clockâ  i asked if two boxes bad arrived marked  b  c   and i think the numbers were  18 and 19 â  i mentioned that to himâ  he said they had arrivedâ  i then asked him if he could inform me what time they would arrive as the bank of englandâ  he said   they are about arriving there at this time â  i believe there was a second person thereâ  the porter  who waited in the office when the clerks were not thereâ  it was not kingstonâ  i have seen him here to dayâ  i think it was mitchell cross examined  q  you were examined on the last trial  a  yesâ  to the best of my knowledge  the prisoner is the person i sawâ  i do not swear he is the person q  will you swear that you believe he is the man  a  no court  q  do you understand the question you have said you believed you saw the prisoner  do you mean you do not mean to represent your belief that he is the man  a  i believe he is the man  but i cannot swear it mr  jones  q  do you mean to swear you believe he is the man  a  yes  that is my beliefâ  i cannot swear positivelyâ  i swear i believe he is the manâ  i remember being examined on the last trial upon this point q  did you not swear on that occasion that you did not see any one in court that you saw on that occasion  looking at the prisoner  a  i hadnot caught sight of him thenâ  i did swear that  but it was before i had seen the prisonerâ  never having been in a court before  i looked all round and did not see the prisonerâ  i said on the last trial that i would not undertake to swear to him by any means q  did you say a word on the last trial about asking the person you saw there when the boxes would be taken to the bank of england  a  yes  that i didâ  i swear that court  q  you are not asked whether the fact passed  but whether you stated on the former trial that you put the question to the prisoner what time they would arrive at the bank of england  a  i certainly gave that statement here  i am confident cross examined bymr  jones  q  do you mean to swear you said so on the last trial  a  i believe i repeated it as near as possible in the same words i have nowâ  i certainly answered the question  and in the same words i think as i have stated nowâ  i asked him if he could inform me what time they would arrive at the bank  and he said   they are arriving about this time â  i stated that at the last trialâ  i will swear thatâ  i believe i gave that in a confused way  and i was stoppedâ  i was giving the two sentences together and i was stopped  and whether i gave it a second time or not i cannot swearâ  i should think it was as early at one o clock in the afternoon that i went thereâ  i will not be positive whether it was or notâ  i know it was about the middle of the day jury  q  had you ever been to mr  hartley s office before the 25th of march  a  many timesâ  i do not recollect ever seeing the prisoner there on the different occasions henry mossre examined bymr  clarkson  q  i forgot to ask you yesterday whether in the course of your conversations with the prisoner any thing passed on the subject of a letter received from mr  hartley  a  on sunday  the 24th of march  the prisoner was at my house with his father  and the prisoner showed me a letter he had received from dublinâ  i mentioned that at the police office before the letter was shown to meâ  the subject of that letter was a complaint of his not having acknowledged the receipt of 300l â  i have no doubt this is the letter  no  7   this letter being read in part  was dated dublin  21st march  and was as follows  â   dear sir  this day week i sent you an order for 300l   to be lodged on my credit at williams and co  s  and you have not to this day acknowledged the receipt    c jury  q  in the different statements you have made concerning this transaction  did you always make the same statement with respect to the share  the prisoner had in the transaction  a  precisely toâ  i have always attributed to him the same share in the transaction cross examined  q  i think you say you made three different statements  a  i think 1 didâ  i am confident i mentioned the prisoner s name in the first statementâ  i gave that statement to davis  who took it from me and took it somewhereâ  i am quite confident i have always mentioned the prisoner to be in the situation i have placed him at the present timeâ  i swear his name was mentioned in the statement davis took awayâ  it must have been after nine o clock  or about nine o clock  that i saw ellis caspar in my parlour on monday night  the 25th of marchâ  rather after than beforeâ  i was fetched from the public house to him by my servantâ  i could not have sworn on the last trial that it was eight o clock q  perhaps you have found out since that lea swore he did not leave ellis caspar till nine o clock  a  no john roe  i am an officer of the city  my assistance was called in on the 26th of march last respecting thisâ  after being at the office of mr  hartley  i went to st  paul s coffee house  and saw the prisoner thereâ  he came while i was thereâ  i asked him if he had the two letters with him  the one purporting to come from falmouth  and the other from marsh and co  of broad streetâ  his answer was  yes  he had  and be then produced them to meâ  these are them  nos  3 and 4 â  no  4 was just in the same state as it is now  with the back torn off  but the letters  er  leftâ  i said  i suppose you know to whom this was addressed  â  he said  no  i do not â  i said   was it in that state when it was delivered to you by the gentleman  â  he said he could not say whether it was torn off before or since  all he had to look at was to see whether the signature was a genuine one  and which he believed it wasâ  on the 1st of april following  in consequence of information i received  i went to new street  whitechapel roadâ  i found a house there without any body in itâ  i went from there to mansel street to the witness mossâ  i had not communicated to either of the caspars that i was going to mansel streetâ  as far as i know they had no means of knowing what i was aboutâ  while i was in mansel street i saw the prisoner and his father both within thirty or forty yards of the houseâ  they were merely coming down the street when i first saw them  and they immediately turned round again and went awayâ  mr  hartley was with meâ  we overtook them  and mr  hartley asked the prisoner what he did thereâ   at that time we knew nothing against old caspar â  his answer was he understood we had searched a house and found the gold  and he had come there to satisfy himselfâ  he did not say who told him so  nor point out the houseâ  he said he understood we had searched court  q  he did not describe what street  or what place  a  no  but gave that as his reason for being in that street mr  clarkson  q  do you remember seeing the prisoner and having conversation with him about his knowledge of moss  a  yes  that was the next dayâ  i had not found any thing at that timeâ  i had searched moss s lodging on the morning i saw him in mansel street  but found nothingâ  on the following afternoon  about four o clock  i saw the prisoner in john street  and asked him if he knew a person of the name of mossâ  he said   yes  i do  two or three  one was my father s foreman once â  i said   where does he live  â  he said   i don t know â  i said   when did you see him last  â  he said   about seven months ago â  i said   what was your business with him then  â  he said   i merely met him by accident  and asked him how he did â  upon his giving that account  mr  hartley gave him into my custodyâ  that was on the 2nd of aprilâ  moss surrendered himself to me about the middle of aprilâ  i have possession of a handkerchief  which i produced yesterdayâ  i got it from a man named fiestell jonas couter  i am a letter carrier in the general post officeâ  mr  hartley s office  in john street  is in my delivery  and was so in march last yearâ  i have an account of letters delivered for mr  hartley on the 25th of marchâ  the amount of the letters delivered that day was 7s  10d â  i only keep an account of the unpaid letters cross examined  q  were there any paid letters  do you know  a  i cannot recollect  there might have beenâ  i have been in the habit of delivering letters at mr  hartley s office nearly five yearsâ  there have some timesbeen disputes and mistakes  but i always stuck to my bookâ  i was right and they wrong mr  clarkson  q  have you ever had complaints that you made a mistake against yourself  in not having charged enough  a  no  i think notâ  this would be against myself william davis  i am an inland messenger of the general post office  there is a circular stamp kept at the general post office  with which all unpaid letters are stampedâ  the bags  on the 25th of march  were divided into eight divisionsâ  each division was stamped with a particular letterâ  there were four stamps for each of the seven divisions  and one for the eighth  which is an auxiliary divisionâ   looking at the post mark on letter no  3 â  this stamp i do not consider the office stampâ  it is not the genuine stamp of the officeâ  it is the london mark  e  m  r  25 â  39  â  from the appearance of that stamp  that letter could not have come through the general post officeâ   looking at no  4 â  this is not the genuine london stampâ  that could not have come through the general post officeâ  it would not get such a stamp by coming through the postâ   looking at no  2 â  this is the genuine london post stampâ  the form of the letters and the figures on the stamps on nos  3 and 4 have been imitatedâ  i have the genuine stamp with me  but there has been an alteration as regards the date  from  39  to  40 â  we change them yearlyâ  the circle of the letter  e  is the sameâ  the genuine stamp of the day and year was produced on the last trial  but since that the  39  has been altered to  40 â  the letter  e  is a fixture  and the figures  18  in the circleâ  the same type is used for m  r  this year as in 39â  here is an impression  taken in a book on that day before the duty commencesâ   producing it â  all  the genuine impressions would exactly correspond with this cross examined  q  did you stamp letters on the 25th of march  a  i did notâ  the book is signed by atkinsonâ  i should think these stamps would be calculated to deceive an ordinary eye  but would be detected by the experienced eye of a post office clerk jane bradley  on the 25th of march  last year  i lived with the witness moss as his servant  and had done to about two yearsâ  he lived in new street  just by the london hospital  all the time i was with himâ  he went out in a working dress when he went to work in a morningâ  that was generally the case  except on sundaysâ  on monday  the 25th of march  he went out about half past eight o clock in the morning  as near as i can recollectâ  he was dressed in his best clothesâ  he returned between one and two o clock  as dear as i can recollectâ  i heard a knock at the doorâ  it was one knockâ  he usually gave a double knockâ  mistress opened the door to himâ  i heard him say when he was let in   where is the girl  â  he usually dined between one and two o clockâ  he did not stop to dinner that dayâ  he did not remain long before he went out again  i think  about half an hour  as near as i can recollect  but i cannot recollectâ  he came back again directly  and asked for his handkerchiefâ  mistress brought him down two handkerchiefs  and i gave them to himâ  one was a kind of red one  i forget the colour of the otherâ  he came back in the evening  i think  about eight o clock  as near as i can guess  and had his teaâ  he then washed himself  put on his common coat  the coat he went to work in  and went outâ  i cannot say at what time he went outâ  while he was out  ellis caspar called at my master s house  and i went to the earl st  vincent public house to fetch my masterâ  i knew i should findhim thereâ  he came back with meâ  ellis caspar was still thereâ  i did not sleep in the houseâ  i think i left about eleven o clock that nightâ  ellis caspar was there still in the house with masterâ  i returned next morning  i think  about half past six o clockâ  it was my duty to light the fireâ  the fire place looked very dirty  and was all over white ashesâ  it seemed to be the ashes of woodâ  there were some nails mixed with them  and the hob had red sealing wax on itâ  my master was in bed when i got thereâ  my mistress went out directly after i got thereâ  my master came down soon after  about half an hour after mistress went out  between seven and eight o clock  i believeâ  he went out after dinnerâ  he dined about one o clockâ  i do not recollect that he went out from seven o clock in the morning till one o clockâ  he went out about half an hour or an hour after dinnerâ  i found lodgings were taken in mansel street  which is about a mile from new streetâ  i packed up  to take the things awayâ  there was a box  secured with a ropeâ  it was mr  moss s daughter s boxâ  it appeared very heavyâ  i saw it taken away in a truckâ  we went to the new lodging in mansel street on the tuesday night cross examined  q  were you taken up on this matter  a  yesâ  i was kept under lea s care  at the flying horse public houseâ  i do not live with moss nowâ  i have learnt a businessâ  i was at home on sunday  the 24th of march  at moss s house  all dayâ  i had my meals thereâ  they dined about one o clock on sundaysâ  that was the usual hour  sometimes laterâ  it might be a little after one o clock  because he came home from workâ  he used to work on sundayâ  he went out to work that sunday  about nine o clock  and came home about one o clock  or a little afterâ  he came home by himselfâ  i did not see any body with himâ  nobody came to dinner that dayâ  ellis caspar came while they were having dinnerâ  he was in the front parlourâ  i did not see any more persons come that dayâ  i did not see him come with my masterâ  i think he came while he was at dinner  and went into the parlourâ  then moss went and spoke to him  and then he went home  and moss went to his workâ  i do not recollect whether i opened the door to himâ  i saw him thereâ  i think he remained about half an hourâ  i was in the back parlour q  and he in the front parlour  with your master and mistress  a  mistress was not thereâ  i opened the room door  i think  and let him inâ  i told master mr  caspar wanted him  and ellis caspar went into the front parlourâ  i do not recollect going into that parlour while he remained there q  can you tell whether any body except your master and ellis caspar was in the parlour  a  no  i cannot  but there was somebody else there at nightâ  i do not recollect any body else being there between one and two o clockâ  i did not see them  but i was about my workâ  i did not let any body else inâ  i did not see ellis caspar go away  but i heard the door shutâ  somebody was there on sunday night  but i did not see themâ  i left the house that night  i dare say  between nine and ten o clockâ  my master came home about eight o clock on the monday evening  washed  and went outâ  he had gone  it might be about half an hour  when ellis caspar cameâ  the earl st  vincent public house is not a great way from the houseâ  it would take me five or ten minutes to walk thereâ  my master came with me  and found ellis caspar at his house when we got there q  did you notice what time ellis caspar came to your master s house that night  a  i think it was about nine o clock  or a little afterâ  i thinkit was as much as that  but i cannot exactly sayâ  i think it was about nine o clockâ  the earl st  vincent public house is not within three or four doors of the houseâ  it is not in the same street  you turn down a street  and then down another streetâ  it is at the back of the hospital q  do you remember at any time  after this business  being in a hackney coach  a  yes  i got into it  i think  in whitecbapelâ  roe and lea were with meâ  nobody else came into the coach while i was in it  that i know ofâ  there was no person there who i did not knowâ  i do not know where i went in the coachâ  i got out at a place i think was an officeâ  it was not lambeth streetâ  i do not know where it wasâ  i was not in a hackney coach with them at any other time mr  clarkson  q  you do not recollect  positively  whether you opened the door or not yourself on sunday  a  no  i remember seeing ellis casparâ  whether there was any body else  i do not know court  q  where was mrs  moss at dinner on sunday  a  she was thereâ  we dined in the back parlour  but they were in the front parlour thomas harland  on the 25th of march last  i was the driver of a cabâ  i was on the stand at cornhillâ  about twelve o clock that day  moss got into my cab  and desired me to drive him to iron gate wharf  which i didâ  one of the porters came outâ   looking at kingston â  that is the manâ  he came to the cab doorâ  moss remained in the cab some timeâ  the porter fetched a gentlemanâ   looking at mr  bristow â  that is the gentle manâ  moss showed him a bill or letterâ  he then went out of the cab into the wharfâ  he was followed out of the wharf by a man who put two boxes into the cabâ  there was some red wax on thenâ  moss had a blue bagâ  i gave one of the porters a four penny piece  by his directionâ  i do not recollect whether he gave the porter any thingâ  i think he gave kingston a shillingâ  i drove him to the cross keys public house  wood streetâ  he told me to drive fastâ  the boxes were taken out there  and put into the office  and i was dismissed john macbeth  i am a cab driver  on the 25th of march last  i was in cheapsideâ  moss hired me  and told me to drive to the cross keys  wood streetâ  one box  in a blue bag  and another not in a bag  were put into the cabâ  he told me to drive him to the london hospitalâ  i was going to drive into the hospital  but he called out  and got out at the corner of the hospital  that is no great distance from new streetâ  he took one box out with him  which was in the bag  and told me to take care of the otherâ  he came back  with a blue bag empty in about three quarters of an hour  and told me to drive him to the iron bridgeâ  the remaining box was still in the cabâ  i went down commercial road  but he pulled me up just beyond limehouse church  on the left handâ  he got out  put the box on the pavement  and put it into the bagâ  i assisted him  as the box was heavyâ  there were seals and pink tape round itâ  this was about one o clock cross examined  q  did you see any one else with him at the london hospital  a  no one at allâ  moss had rather mare whiskers then than he has to dayâ  they were black whiskersâ  and he had a blue rough frock coat  not the sort of coat he has on nowâ  to the best of my knowledge  it was a blueish coat  and a frock coatâ  i believe  i am positive of its being a frock coat  and a blue one mr  clarkson  q  have you any recollection of his dress at allâ  can you undertake to swear what his dress  was  a  no george carthewre examined  q  is mitchell the man you saw  a  he is notâ  it was a much taller man  and olderâ  i do not think he is the man mr  jones  q  look at that young gentleman  blundell  will you undertake to say he is not the person you saw at the office when you asked about the boxes of gold  a  i have no recollection of ever seeing mr  blundell at that officeâ  i do not know that i could swear  he might not be the man  but my recollection carries me that the prisoner is the person i speak of mr  clarkson  q  you have no recollection of ever having seen blundell at the office at all  a  not up to that timeâ  i have since william blundellre examined bymr  jones  q  do you know carthew  a  no  i never saw him before  that i am aware ofâ  i might have seen him standing about hereâ  i do not remember having any conversation with him at the office about the specie court  q  did you ever tell any man  on the 25th of march  that the specie would be about that time at the bank of englandâ  did any body ask you if you could inform him what time they would arrive at the bank of england  a  i believe there was a man calledâ  i believe he asked me that questionâ  i believe it was while the prisoner was absentâ  i cannot undertake to swear that person was not carthewâ  i do not know who he wasâ  i do not remember whether the man stated that he came from the brazilian company mr  clarkson  q  you do not recollect seeing carthew  a  no  i do not recollect the person of the man who called  or whether he was young or old court  q  was the question put to you at mr  hartley s office  whether two boxes of gold dust had arrived  marked  b  c  18 and 19   by any vessel from falmouth  a  i believe something to that effectâ  it was put to meâ  i believe i answered   yes â  the same person asked if i could inform him what time they would arrive at the bank  and i think the answer i gave was   they are there by this time  q  how did you know any thing about it  a  i knew they would be landed about ten o clock  and by that time they would arrive at the bank of englandâ  i knew they were expected by the manifest bookâ  i had copied the manifest into the book mr  clarkson  q  were there several inquiries made about the boxes  a  no  i believe not george sheen  i helped to move moss s goods from new street to mansel streetâ  a box was produced to me upon the last trialâ  that was very much like one of the boxes i moved upon that occasionâ  i know mrs  levy  moss s sisterâ  she was there assisting george read  i am a tailor  and live in northumberland place  commercial road  i had a house in new street  no  12  on the 26th march  moss lived thereâ  he went away on the 27th joseph jepson  i live in mansel street  in march last year mrs  moss engaged apartments at my houseâ  the goods came in on the 26th and 27th edward henry  i live in bread street  cheapside  and am a merchant  i knew moss in the service of mr  hyams  who i had dealingswith  on the 25th of march  moss came to my houseâ  i gave him a cheque that morning before ten o clockâ  i do not exactly recollect the hourâ  this is the cheque   no  9  lucy marshall  i am a widow  i lived opposite moss s house in new streetâ  i knew his person well  on monday  the 25th of march last  i saw him go into his house  about three o clock  or between three and four o clockâ  i observed he had something very weighty with himâ  he used to have a plate with his name on the door  and next morning i observed that the plate was taken offâ  i saw the goods being moved away that dayâ  a box  was shown to me at the last trialâ  i saw a box like that moved out adolphus fieldstell  in march last  and before that  i kept a coffee shop in great tower street  i have known the prisoner a long timeâ  i was not acquainted with moss at that timeâ  i remember the prisoner coming to my coffee shopâ  it must have been before marchâ  i think in january  at the end of januaryâ  there was a gentleman with him  but i cannot recollect himâ  they had coffee thereâ  after they were gone i found a pocket handkerchiefâ   looking at the one produced by roe â  i believe this is the handkerchiefâ  i had known the prisoner a very long timeâ  he had never been to my coffee shop before  to my knowledgeâ  i am certain of his having been there on that occasionâ  i believe this to be the handkerchief  but i gave it directly to my wife  and did not examine it so accuratelyâ  i had it back from her afterwards  and delivered it up at the police office  to lea or roeâ   looking at roe â  that is the gentlemanâ  i gave him the same handkerchief as i picked up that day cross examined  q  had you ever seen the prisoner at your shop before  a  not to my knowledgeâ  i have known him from a childâ  i did not know moss at allâ  i cannot swear to his personâ  he might have been at my coffee shopâ  there may be a hundred people in my house at a timeâ  i swear i do not recollect mossâ  i have never seen him at my coffee house since to my knowledge  and i do not swear it was him with the prisonerâ  i found the handkerchief  and gave it to my wile instantlyâ  i do not believe any one was in the room when i found it  because it was about six o clock  when they went away  and i went up stairs to see if any body had left any thing  and found the handkerchiefâ  i took it down to my wife instantlyâ  it was about half past six or seven o clock in the evening when i found it  to the best of my recollectionâ  i had a waiter at that time who was my wife s brotherâ  i solemnly declare he was not present when i found itâ  i knew where the prisoner s father lived at that timeâ  i found the handkerchief in the place where the prisoner and the other had sat q  did you take any pains to inform the prisoner you had found it  a  i did not see him afterwards  but i left it  saying  should mr  caspar call  for the handkerchief to be returnedâ  i did not send to him  because i did not know who had lost it  the prisoner or his companionâ  i believed one of them had  but many other people came to the house q  why not send to the prisoner to say you had it  a  i did not know whether the prisoner would not come back to ask for itâ  i should not have kept it if it had not been inquired forâ  it is in possession of the officerâ  i kept it five  six  or seven weeksâ  i did not know where the prisoner lived  and if i had  i expected he might have called again  and that might have been another 1s  in my pocketâ  i have never had any communication with moss since that time q  do you mean to swear you saw that handkerchief for the first time on the day the prisoner was at your shop  a  i can swear positively  i believe it is the handkerchief i found at the time the prisoner was at my house  but i will not positively swear it is the handkerchief until my wife identifies it court  q  the question is  whether you found it on the day the prisoner was at your house  a  yes  i did mr  jones  q  do you know davis  a  a little jew has called at my house  i believe  onceâ  i swear solemnly that i did not know he was moss s stepfatherâ  i heard afterwards that he wasâ  i saw davisâ  i do not know where he livedâ  he did not tell meâ  he came with another personâ  i have not received 15l  from davis since this transactionâ  i received 2l  from him at the time he came to my house with a person named mrs  abrahamsâ  i mean the mrs  abrahams who was triedâ  they came to my shop a few days after the prisoners were taken upâ  the handkerchief was produced to themâ  they did not ask for itâ  they came while i was out  and applied to my wife  and she showed it to themâ  i saw them when i came home q  what did you receive the 2l  for  a  i did not know davi s at all  but mrs  abrahams came to me  and said   do you know caspar  â  i said   yes â  she said   how long is it since you have seen him  â  i said   about two months ago  q  on what account did you receive the 2l   a  i must tell you what forâ  he did not owe me any moneyâ  i did not know himâ  he gave me the moneyâ  he made me a present of itâ  i had seen davis before  but not known himâ  i never had any previous transaction with him q  now  why did he give it you  a  mrs  abrahams called on me with him  and i knew mrs  abrahams very wellâ  she said   mr  fiestell  do you know the name of caspar  â  i said   yes â  she said   do you know the gentleman who was with him  can you recollect him  â  i said   no â  she said   don t you know mr  moss  â  i said i did notâ  she said   suppose i tell you how he looks  so and so â  i said   tell me what you like  i can t recollect him â  she said   i shall describe him to you â  i said   if i take descriptions of people who come to my house i must have a very good memory  but  perhaps  if you show him to me i may recollect him â  at that time there was 500l  reward against moss  and it appeared to me they would not let me see himâ  david made me a present of 2l  to induce me to say i knew him  but i would not q  but you took the 2l   a  certainly  why should not i  but when i came to the office he was pointed out to me  and i said   no  i can t swear to him   and i would not swear to him q  it was given to you to swear moss had been at your coffee house with caspar  a  he made me a present of itâ  the handkerchief was shown by my wife  but not in my presenceâ  i believe i did not see itâ  i might have seen it  or i might notâ  i believe i did not  because it was shown to them beforeâ  they had called twice q  was it not mentioned in that conversation that you should swear that handkerchief was left when the prisoner was at your house  a  i cannot recollect it q  do you mean to swear you cannot recollect  a  i cannot recollect that the handkerchief was shown q  that is not the questionâ  will you swear you cannot recollect whetherthe 2l  was given to you to swear you found it there on a day when the prisoner bad been at your shop  a  i do not recollectâ  i do not know what they gave me the 2l  for court  q  did they suggest to you that you should prove the handkerchief was left when the prisoner was there  at the time you had the 2l   a  the 2l  was given to me to swear i knew moss  to identify himâ  there was no talk about the handkerchief  to my recollection mr  jones  q  now  were you not asked  in the course of conversation  to swear the handkerchief was left there on a day when the prisoner was there  a  it might be soâ  i will not swear to what i cannot recollectâ  you will not make me swear what i do not recollectâ  it might have been said so court  q  were you not asked   cannot you prove this handkerchief was left at the time caspar was at your house   a  yes  that was the caseâ  it was leftâ  that was the point  that i should identify moss  which i would not do mr  jones  q  did not davis bring a handkerchief with him on that occasion  a  he did notâ  nor did mrs  abrahams  neither of themâ  no handkerchief was produced but this one  which i believe to be the handkerchief i found court  q  did either of them state to you that they were in a condition to prove the handkerchief left with you belonged to moss  a  yes  mrs  abrahams said so mr  jones  q  can you tell how either davis or mrs  abrahams knew that the handkerchief was left there  a  i told mrs  abrahams and mr  davis there was a handkerchief left by those people  by mr  caspar  here it is  and i showed it to themâ  they had not said a word about a handkerchief before i didâ  i will swear that they never mentioned a single word till i showed itâ  they then asked whether i recollected caspar calling  with another gentleman with him  mr  mossâ  i said   i don t know him  i knew caspar from a child â  they said   do you know what has happened  â  i said   i have heard there is some robbery â  they said   you  remember he came to have some coffee â  i said   yes  caspar came with another person  but i don t know him â  mrs  abrahams described him  and said that he had whiskers before  and that he took the whiskers offâ  i said   i can say nothing about it till you show me the man â  davis gave me 2l â  i said   very well  i will receive this as a gift  but i must see the man before i swear to himâ  i did not return the money when i could not swear to him court  q  did you show them the handkerchief and say   i cannot swear to the man until i have seen him  but i have a handkerchief that one of them i believe left   a  noâ  they had been several times  but the  first time they came i was out  and i understood my wife had shown it to themâ  she looked at it and at last found a markâ  mrs  abrahams said   oh  i believe he has lost a handkerchief â  davis then gave me the 2l  to swear positively to moss that i knew him  but i said   i will go to the police office   but when i got there i did not know him  and would not swear to himâ  they asked me to swear that i saw him mr  jones  q  did they ask you to swear caspar was there  a  yes  they did of courseâ  i do not know whether it was before or after they asked me to swear that  that they gave me the 2l â  i could not deny caspar being there  as i knew himâ  they asked me to state caspar was thereâ  i cannot say whether it was after that that they gave methe 2l â  that is the only sum i have received from any personâ  if they had offered me 100l  it would be the same as 2l â  i was quite satisfied  i would not swear to any thing i did not knowâ  i did not ask them for any moreâ  they did not promise me any moreâ  they promised me if i wished to do so that they would give me a 20l  note if i would identify caspar  i mean moss  but i would not q  i ask you if they did not offer you a 20l  note to swear caspar was there  a  i told you they  in the plural  they both were thereâ  they did not ask me particularly to swear that the prisoner was there  but that both he and moss were thereâ  that was after moss was taken upâ  i have never seen davis sinceâ  i did not see him at lambeth street officeâ  the only time i saw him was at my house  twice he calledâ  i knew him from seeing him  but had not any particular knowledge of himâ  i will not swear i had not spoken to him before  but i never had any business with him  nor did i know what he wasâ  i did not know he lived in coventry court till afterwardsâ  i never went thereâ  i kept the coffee shop ten or eleven monthsâ  i was also an agent for foreign winesâ  my counting house is 84  lower tower streetâ  i am still an agent for foreign winesâ  i do commissionsâ  i am a general agentâ  before i went to tower street i kept a fancy toy shop in lowther arcadeâ  i was there eighteen monthsâ  i was always the same trade  a foreign agent in the wine trade  and so i am now q  what do you mean  a  suppose a foreigner comes over  having wines to sell  i have customers  and sell them  and my commission is five per centâ  i have been a bankrupt  to my misfortune  only once  and obtained my certificate in 1824â  i have twice taken the benefit of the insolvent actâ  the last time is three years and a half agoâ  i believe the first time was about seven years agoâ  i was discharged the first timeâ  i was remanded once i believe six or seven months  but i did not stop all the time out  because i settled with the detaining creditorâ  i was detained for defending an action without groundsâ  i have never been in the habit of becoming bail for people mr  clarkson  q  can you tell how the prisoner  or any body belonging to him  knew any thing about davis and mrs  abrahams coming to your house  a  i do not knowâ  i was examined on the former trial when mrs  abrahams was chargedâ  i was not then asked a word about the 2l â  i have heard that davis is indicted with the restâ  i never had any doubt that the prisoner was one of the persons who came to my houseâ  i never attempted to swear moss was the other manâ  they offered me 20l  to swear itâ  i did not know  at the time davis and mrs  abrahams came to my house  that mrs  abrahams had had the gold dust through her handsâ  i never knew that either she or davis had had any thing to do with it james lea  i was an officer of lambeth street  on the 25th of march i remember the prisoner coming to the office and seeing mr  hardwicke  the magistrate  about half past two o clockâ  he produced these two lettersâ   nos  3 and 4 â  he said a serious robbery had taken place that morning  at irongate wharf  and that a person had come in a cab from mr  marchâ  he gave me a description of the mode in which it had been effected  that he had given it to a person who came in the name of mr  marchâ  i afterwards went to irongate wharfâ  he staid some few minutes with me at the wharfâ  he then left me  and said he could be of no further use to meâ  i staid some time  and then went to the office in john street  and saw the prisonerâ  he opened a drawer  and producedthree or four letters of messrs  carries   and asked my opinion as to the writing  whether it did not correspond with the two letters i had before seenâ  he said he considered himself they were one and the same writingâ  i said   no  they appear to me quite a different writing â  he then particularly drew my attention to messrs  carne s signatureâ  i said that appeared to correspond with the others very muchâ  he said it was principally on the faith of the signature he had given the order to the person for the boxesâ  i asked him at that time the description of the person who had been to receive the orderâ  he said he was a man shorter than himself  grey whiskers  it appeared as if he had been a traveller  that he had a weather beaten countenanceâ  if i recollect right  he said he appeared to be about sixty years of age  and had grey hairâ  he laid he did not know himâ  he said he supposed  from what he stated  that he had come from mr  march  and he did not know whether it was mr  march or notâ  about eight o clock that night i was at the swan with two necks  making inquiry about the falmouth coach  and while there  the prisoner and his father came inâ  he inquired about the falmouth mail  and said he was going by the falmouth mailâ  i made inquiry  and found the mail had been gone about a quarter of an hour before they came inâ  i told the prisoner i thought if he had a wish to go  be might overtake the mail at the southampton rail roadâ  i went with them in a coach  but the mail had been gone about ten minutes i thinkâ  the mail goes by the rail roadâ  i do not think he had stated to me before  any intention of going to falmouthâ  i have no recollection of itâ  he called at two or three coach offices coming back  and said he should go next morningâ  as we returned  ellis caspar left the coachâ  i am not quite positive where he left itâ  i thought it was at charing cross  but it was between charing cross and st  paul sâ  the prisoner said there would be hand bills out next day  and 500l  reward offeredâ  he said mr  allen  and mr  de mole were to have them printedâ  i expressed a wish to see mr  de mole before they were printed  and the prisoner requested his father to go immediately to prevent their being printedâ  i had been to the st  paul s coffee house in the morning  and found three persons were putting up there from the falmouth mail that day  and i went to see themâ  i called there again in the evening with the prisoner  after his father leftâ  i gave a description of the person as the prisoner had given me  grey hair  and whiskers  a person  shorter than him  and about sixty years of ageâ  he never contradicted me  or said that was not the personâ  there was a description given then  that such a person had been thereâ  one of the three who had come by the mailâ  i think the waiter gave me that description  and the prisoner said that appeared the sort of description of the personâ  that person was described as about sixty years of age  with grey hair and whiskersâ  the prisoner also said he thought i could not do better than to pursue the inquiry there  and stick to the person at that houseâ  he also told me the same thing  two days afterwards q  how long afterwards did you trace the cab to new street  a  the first cab i traced  when the prisoner was with me  in the minoriesâ  i afterwards traced a cab to the neighbourhood of new street  and went to a house in new street  which had no tenant  and where a plate had been taken off the doorâ  i have since ascertained that to be moss s houseâ  i found a quantity of nails in the grate  and some under the grate  and some in the dust hole q  could you judge what had been burning in the fire place  a  it appeared to me to be white wood ashesâ  there were several pieces of wood  and about sixty nails  which i produced at the last trialâ  some of the wood was partly consumedâ  i left them here at the last trialâ  i went to new street three or four days after the robberyâ  i did not notice any sealing waxâ  i afterwards went with mr  hartley to mansel street  and saw the prisoner  about five o clock in the evening  with his father  nearly opposite moss s house  in mansel streetâ  i had some conversation with the prisoner afterwardsâ  i took mrs  moss and mrs  levy into custodyâ  i afterwards produced a box  found in a small room adjoining the bed roomâ  i ultimately produced five gold bars cross examined  q  from what you saw of the prisoner  did not he appear anxious to afford you every assistance to find out the thieves  a  he appeared very uneasy when he came to the office about itâ  i should say he expressed great anxiety to find out the thieves for the first half hourâ  i saw very little of him after the first dayâ  he did on the first dayâ  he went with me to the wharf  and to the coffee houseâ  he was the first person i received information from of the jobberyâ  he did not describe the man as rather taller than himself  i understood him shorterâ  as far as my recollection serves me  i think he said shorterâ  i will not be positiveâ  i stated on the last trial  that that was the description he gaveâ  i obtained from the cat men a description of the man who went to the wharfâ  that description did not correspond with the one given me by the prisonerâ  neither of themâ  harland described him as a tall man  in black  and dark whiskersâ  i do not recollect macbeth s descriptionâ  he said nothing to me about grey hairâ  he did not describe him as about sixty years of ageâ  i received a description from blundellâ  he said he was a tall person with dark hair  and whiskersâ  the first cab man i saw was harlandâ  i saw three altogether  but the first i have not mentioned  as i could not find his addressâ  the prisoner went with me  when i saw that cab man  who said he had been with a person to the office  in john street  and put a person down at the bankâ  i asked that person for a description of him  and he described him as a tall man  in black  and dark hair  and he thought he had the appearance of a jewâ  he did not describe him as a man with grey hair  and whiskers  and that cab man identified the prisoner as having come to our office in his cabâ  i said   it is strange you should come here in the same cab â  it was not through the information i received from the prisoner that i traced the cabsâ  he said the man came in a yellow cab with four wheelsâ  that was the only description of itâ  i never could find that cab man out afterwardsâ  the other two cab men were examined at the officeâ  neither of them stated  on seeing moss  that he was not the manâ  the first cab man was not examined  for i took his number down  and i expect i made a mistake in one of the figures  for i could not trace him outâ  the first cab man did not see moss in my presence court  q  what time did the prisoner come to you in that cab said to be the same  a  about half past two or three o clock prisoner  the first cab man was examined  and said he could not recognise moss  and so his deposition was not taken  witness  i do not recollect any thing of that kind prisoner  he lived in gray s inn road  witness  yes  he gave me his direction  but i could trace no such person out mr  jones  q  are you quite positive he was never examined at lambeth street  a  i do not recollect seeing himâ  i cannot say that he did not state moss was not the manâ  i know nothing of itâ  i received the gold bars from dean  solomon s shopman  on the 17th of aprilâ  i left the swan with two necks in a coach  in company with the two caspars  i think from ten minutes to a quarter after eight o clock  and went to the southampton railway at queen s elmsâ  we got there in about half an hour  staid there about five minutes and then came backâ  we called at two booking offices in the circus  st  james s street  and another in piccadillyâ  i think it must have been somewhere about nine o clock when ellis caspar left the coachâ  it might be a quarter pastâ  it might be half past  i will not pretend to sayâ  we drove fast backâ  we went up waterloo placeâ  we made no stay thereâ  the prisoner got out and inquired about the coachâ  ellis caspar was not with me in st  paul s church yard i knowâ  i cannot recollect precisely where he got outâ  i rather think it was between charing cross and st  paul s church yard q  supposing he got out at charing cross  how far is that from moss s house  in new street  a  two miles and a half  i thinkâ  i do not think it is three milesâ  about two and a halfâ  i think it is under three milesâ  we made no stop at either place coming backâ  we left the station at about twenty minutes before nine o clockâ  it would take the best part of a quarter of an hour to get to charing crossâ  it is about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes  drive from charing cross to queen s elmsâ  i am sure it was not ten o clock when ellis caspar left us q  will you swear it was not a quarter to ten  a  i cannot swear to a quarter of an hour john howard  i was employed by lea  in march last  to watch some people about this robberyâ  i remember good fridayâ  i do not know the day of the monthâ  on that day i saw the prisoner with his fatherâ  i first of all followed the prisoner from mr  hartley s office in john street to his own house in finsbury pavementâ  he went into the house and waited some timeâ  shortly after  his father came out with him  and i followed them down to the office in john street togetherâ  on the monday following the 1st of april  i saw the prisoner with his father in mansel street about five o clockâ  i know moss s house in mansel streetâ  they were about as far from moss s house as i am from the door of this courtâ  i observed ellis caspar put his hand up  pointing to what appeared to me the apartments where moss was living  lolling his head towards the prisoner cross examined  q  have you been in the habit of being employed in that way  a  on one occasionâ  i am now employed in the london dockâ  i watched the prisoner s house on one occasion  but saw nothingâ  i was directed to follow himâ  i followed him to finsbury pavement  and on the door was written  caspar â  i waited a considerable time and saw nothingâ  i have never said i watched their house from morning till nightâ  i stated on the last trial that i watched the prisoners all 1 could  but never said about watching their house james leare examined bymr  jones  q  did you make inquiry at mr  hartley s office of the different clerks there  as to the description of the man who went in the cab  a  i didâ  they did not all agree in the descriptionâ  one of them differedâ  none of them described the man as having grey whiskersâ  i believe mitchell gave a different description of him q  did you not swear on the last trial that blundell described the manprecisely in the same way as the prisoner had  a  no  i do not recollectâ  one of mr  hartley s servants gave a different description of himâ  some said he was taller than the other  and different to what the other described himâ  it is possible one of them might have said something about grey whiskersâ  one of them  i do not recollect which  said he thought he had grey hairs in his whiskersâ  i do not recollect stating on the last trial that blundell s description corresponded with the prisoners as to the whiskersâ  as near as i can recollect  i think it was mitchell stated something about itâ  i remember one of them said he had grey hairs in his whiskersâ  i might have said blundell s description corresponded with the prisoner s as to having grey hairs in his whiskers no 5   read    london  23rd march  1839 â  messrs  w  and e  c  came â  dear sirs  a most diabolical robbery has been committed here through the means of forging your signatures to two letters  on the other side i send a copy of them  and i beg that you will use your utmost exertions towards discovering the perpetrator  the impression is that it must have been done by persons who have had access to your office or knew of all the particulars as early as yourselves  the letters were posted at falmouth on the 23rd  and arrived with this morning s manifest  shortly after a gentleman called  requesting the delivery of two boxes marked  b c 18 and 19   he showed me a letter which purported to be mr  march s  or from him  i had not the slightest suspicion  and referred him to the wharf  writing an order for their delivery  unfortunately they were handed to him  and it only remains to use every exertion to obtain a clue  let me beg and entreat of you to show your usual zeal in this matter  believe me  dear sirs  i am almost heart broken  yours very truly  l  casper  the man who called at my office appeared about fifty or sixty years of age  grey whiskers  middling stature  very dark complexion  swarthy  or very sunburnt  as an old traveller would appear  has a country dialect  as if from your parts  i think he was lame  as he walked very slow  or perhaps limped  james hands  police constable k 248   i was at lambeth street office on the 14th of june i thinkâ  i do not exactly recollect the dateâ  the prisoner  ellis caspar  mrs  abrahams  and moses were all four in confinement in one cell in the officeâ  i heard the prisoner conversing with mosesâ  they were talking loudâ  i was not in a situation to see as well as hearâ  i heard the prisoner say to moses   do you intend to let me have any money  i want 40l  or 50l  to prepare for my defence â  moses answered   no  i want four or five fifties to pay or prepare for my own â  the prisoner said   had i have had the 1400l  or 1200l  as you promised me  things might have been different â  moses said  you are a bâ  â  rogue  you did not give him even what you had â  he did not mention who he meant by himâ  there was something said then which i did not hear  and i heard moses say   did you ever give him 5l   cross examined  q  were there any other persons than those you have mentioned confined in the cell  a  no  none but the fourâ  there was not a drunken woman confined as wellâ  there was no drunken woman in custody then  nor any womanâ  there was a drunken woman in the yard  but that was some time afterwardsâ  the cell door was shut when i heard this conversationâ  there were only those two talkingâ  i did not hear the others speakâ  i was in the yardâ  i cannot exactly say how longâ  it might be a quarter of an hour  or five minutes more or lessâ  my attention was taken by hearing them talk  and i went to the door to listenâ  i didnot go backwards and forwards while they were talkingâ  i kept by the doorâ  i cannot exactly say how long i was listening q  when was the first time you told of this conversation  a  i communicated it in part within a few minutes after  to cook  the gaoler  at lambeth streetâ  he heard part of it himself  i believeâ  i stated that at the last trial  and at lambeth street  it might be an hour or two hours after i heard itâ  i had seen the prisoner before that dayâ  i had been in the habit of standing  while he was under examination before the magistrate  close to himâ  i had heard him speak beforeâ  i believe  with the exception of one examination  i heard him every time  which was  i think  six timesâ  i heard him speak while his case was being heardâ  he was in conversation with his solicitor and othersâ  i have never said there was so much confusion in the yard that i could not hear exactly what was saidâ  i said i lost part of the conversation in consequence of an old man coming to draw water from a tap in the yardâ  i did not hear the prisoner ask moses to lend him 5l   or that he had promised to lend him 5l â  that did not pass in my hearing q  did not you state on the last occasion that he said   if i had got the 1200l  or 1400l   as you have  i would not have denied you   a  the prisoner said that before the magistrateâ  when i made the statement before the magistrate  he admitted the conversation  but said he had said  had he got the 1200l  or 1400l   as he  moses was said to have had  he should not have objected to let him have 5l â  that was the substance of the explanation he gave mr  clarkson  q  was the prisoner s explanation a correct account of what passed  or was the account you have given on oath  a  the account i have given on oath adolphus fiestellre examined bymr  jones  my brother in law  callaway  who was my waiter  appeared as a witness on the last trialâ  i was not present when he was examinedâ  he was waiting on the day the prisoner and the other persons were at my coffee houseâ  he waited on themâ  i do not know where he isâ  i cannot find himâ  he left me nine months agoâ  i have not seen him

no  i did not know what part to go to  nor have i sent after himâ  i inquired of fiestell where he wasâ  he said he did not knowâ  i did not hear callaway examined at the last trialâ  i am sure i was not in court when he was examinedâ  i do not think i was in court at the time william blundellre examined  q  did you ever  and if so  at what time  inform the prisoner you had heard some of the gold dust had been found in mansel street  a  no q  did not you tell him mr  hartley was waiting at house in mansel street  or some such street  where he expected to find the thief  or some of the property  and did not you tell him you were going to take some letters to mr  hartley at a house in mansel street  where be expected to find some gold  a  i was going to the green man public house  mansel street and told the prisoner i was going there  and that i expected to see moss thereâ  i told him that  when i went for the letters to the officeâ  i cannot say when it was court  q  how long after the 25th of march was that  a  some few days  i thinkâ  i cannot rememberâ  it might be a fortnightâ  somewhere thereaboutsâ  i was going with letters to the green man public houseâ  i expected to find mr  hartley there  but he was notâ  moss was to have been brought there  i understoodâ  i did not see any thing of the goldâ  i did not describe to the prisoner who moss wasâ  whether they said moss or the man whom they suspected had stolen the dust  i do not know q  who are they  a  the person by whom i was sentâ  somebody in the officeâ  i believe it was the conversation in the office that mr  hartley was gone to the green man public house  and they expected to find the thief thereâ  whether i mentioned moss by name  i do not knowâ  i cannot say when i first heard the name of moss in the transactionâ  it was in the afternoon that i told this to the prisonerâ  i was going to take the general post letters which came that morning by the second delivery q  cannot you tell nearer than that it might be a fortnight after the 25th  a  i cannot sayâ  i cannot say whether it might be longer or shorterâ  i cannot say whether it was the next dayâ  i cannot say whether it was a week  or how long it was afterâ  i believe nobody was present when i said this to the prisonerâ  it was in the back officeâ  i went for the letters in the back office  and received the letters from himâ  i believe one of the clerks in the office told me they expected to find the man  and to take him to the green man public houseâ  i was examined on the former trialâ  i was not asked these questions then that i am aware ofâ  i left the court at six o clock yesterday  and went to the officeâ  i left there at eight o clock  and went homeâ  i have not given information since yesterday that i could prove

office when i told him this  doing the duty of a clerkâ  i am not aware that i had any conversation with the prisoner in the evening of that dayâ  i believe he had been in the office the whole of the morning on which i told him thisâ  i think it was nearly three o clock in the afternoon when i told himâ  i told him the letters i had in my hand i was about to take to the green man public house  to mr  hartley  expecting the thief would be brought there that afternoonâ  i have never spoken or written to the prisoner since he was committed  nor seen his attorney or any bodyâ  i have not spoken to the attorney to day or yesterday q  did you ever tell lea that the person who called in john street on the 25th of march had grey hairs in his whiskers  a  noâ  i gave him a description of the person

went out about four o clock or half past  between four and fiveâ  i would undertake to say he was in my father s house between one and two o clock that dayâ  i am quite certain of itâ  i am quite certain he did not go out from the time he got up till between four and fire o clockâ  i was standing by his side nearly the whole of that time  looking over mr  wilson  who was teaching him drawingâ  he is a designer and draughtsmanâ  my brother was in the habit of visiting mrs  manley  a friendâ  i cannot tell exactly what time he returned that eveningâ  i do not knowâ  he did not return very

a  i looked particularly close  to see if it was my brotherâ  i know moss perfectly well q  was he the person in that cab  a  noâ  i am quite certain he was notâ  it was a yellow bodied cab  with a black top  i believe  but i would not say that positively court  q  the cab man  getting down  grazed your leg  did you complain of the injury  a  yes  i went into the office cryingâ  i saw my brother

but not any brotherâ  my younger brother is nine years of ageâ  my sisters are older than meâ  my mother is livingâ  she is not hereâ  she dined at home with my father and brother that sundayâ  she is at home  and she is distracted  poor creature q  now describe the dress of the man in the cab  a  i cannot tell his dressâ  he was not at all like mossâ  i did not notice his dressâ  i think he had a great coat onâ  i do not think he had a macintosh over itâ  he had a hatâ  i cannot tell whether it was a light great coat he hadâ  i noticed his countenance moreâ  i should not like to swear he had any great coatâ  i did not notice his dress  but his countenanceâ  i did not see him get outâ  i think it was about half past eleven or half past twelve o clockâ  i generally went to my brother from eleven to one o clock  before we dinedâ  i will swear it was before one o clockâ  i will not swear it was before twelve o clockâ  it might have been half past twelve o clockâ  i am certain it was not one o clock  because we generally dined about one o clock  and i gothome some time before we had dinnerâ  my leg was not injured  but hurt  by being kicked againstâ  the man in the cab was a far older man than mossâ  he seemed about sixty  i should thinkâ  i cannot tell what hair he hadâ  he had grey whiskersâ  i did not notice that he stooped particularlyâ  i did not hear his voiceâ  i did not hear any thing he saidâ  i did not see any body come out to himâ  the cab drove off as i went into the officeâ  i did not go before the magistrateâ  i was at home with my mother when my brother and father were charged before the magistrateâ  the cab drove to the minories court  q  how came the man to get off the box when he was driving off  a  the cab was at the office door  and as i walked into the office it drove away mr  clarkson  q  but the man would step on  instead of off  to drive away  a  the man was on the step of the cab talking to the person in the cabâ  he jumped down from the step of the cab  not off the boxâ  i could not look inside the cab from the street  but i had a good view of the manâ  there was only one man  i am certainâ  i could see all inside the cabâ  the step was at the door of the cabâ  it was a low four wheeled cabâ  i did not notice any boxes in itâ  i am quite sure there were no boxes in itâ  i cannot say whether the gentleman had a letterâ  my brother did not come out with himâ  he was in the office when i went inâ  the man was sitting in the cabâ  i think i should know the cab man if i saw himâ  i was not before the magistrates at allâ  the cab man was a great big fellow  with red in his faceâ   looking at the witness moss â  that is the man i know as mossâ  he is well known to our family  and has been for some yearsâ  i should not take him for sixty years of ageâ  i should say he is about thirtyâ  my father was out on monday nightâ  i do not know what time he came homeâ  i go to bed about eight o clock  or between eight and nine q  do you know a man named davis  a  davis  noâ  i know several gentlemen of the name of davisâ  i do not know davis who lived in coventry court  and oxendon streetâ  i do not know mrs  abrahamsâ  i saw her when i went into newgate to see my poor fatherâ  i went into newgate to see my father the day he was committedâ  i knew the day he was triedâ  i did not come forward as a witnessâ  i do not know why q  who brought you here to day  a  i came myselfâ  i have not had a subpoenaâ  mr  robinson told me to comeâ  mr  robinson did not examine me before i came hereâ  nobody examined me before i came hereâ  i told mr  robinson as nearly as possible what i had to say  a few days sinceâ  i think monday weekâ  that was the first time mr  robinson knew itâ  i did not tell himâ  i had told my brother previously  and it was written downâ  i do not know who wrote it downâ  i believe it was enclosed in the briefâ  mr  robinson read it to me  and asked me if i knew every part of that q  when  for the first time  did you tell this to mr  robinson  a  i mentioned about the cab directly i got homeâ  i believe it is in the briefâ  i think i first told mr  robinson on monday weekâ  that was the first time i saw mr  robinson about itâ  i cannot say it was monday weekâ  it was one day in the last weekâ  that was the first time i saw mr  robinsonâ  mr  yates was my father s attorney at the last trialâ  he knew itâ  i did not tell him q  how do you know he knew it  a  the circumstance of the cab i ed when i got home  every body knew it q  how do you know mr  yates knew the circumstances you have come to tell today  a  i have told himâ  i have been to mr  yates sâ  i didnot tell him formally all i bad to say  but i told him about the cabâ  i told him it was not moss who came in the cabâ  that was before my father was triedâ  i did not see him take it down in writingâ  i went to mr  yates with my mother and sistersâ  my mother went to consult him and take him money for counselâ  i was not brought here when my father was tried q  now  consider  a  i was hereâ  i was in the yard the first dayâ  i think i was not here the second dayâ  i am afraid of swearing itâ  swearing is an awful thing for a boy like meâ  i might have been here on the second dayâ  i think i was  on an errand to mr  yatesâ  i was here on messages to mr  yates oftenâ  i do not think i was here the third dayâ  i was not here every day of the trialâ  i was away two or three daysâ  the third  fourth  and fifth days  i think  but when i was here i only came on an errand to mr  yates q  on your solemn oath  were you not here waiting to be called as a witness  a  no  i was notâ  i never gave my evidence ready to be examined as a witnessâ  i was not desired to be here mr  jones  q  had you stated to mr  yates what you had said to your brother about his being at home  a  i merely stated the circumstance  and have said how cruel it was to say so and so about my brother  when i knew the contrary q  were you willing to come forward as a witness on the last trial  to state this if asked to do it  a  a place like this i was almost afraid of coming to  but on it being represented it was useful to my brother  i could not refuse to come q  on your solemn oath  is what you have said about your brother being at home  true or false  a  most certainly it is trueâ  i would not swear a falsityâ  my poor mother is not in a state to come forwardâ  mr  robinson has very recently been engaged as attorney for my brother  instead of mr  yatesâ  we have a servant named sarah coxâ  she and my sisters were all at home on the sunday and monday  at the time i have mentioned q  do you happen to know whether it was left to counsel on the last trial  whether they thought right to call witnesses or not  a  it was left to counsel entirelyâ  my brother wished me to be called on the last trial  and now he has insisted on it ellen caspar  i am the prisoner s sister  i remember sunday the 24th of march lastâ  my brother was in the habit of getting up late on sunday mornings  sometimes at ten  and sometimes ten or eleven o clockâ  on sunday  the 24th of march  he got up between eleven and twelve o clockâ  i remember his coming down stairs that morning about that timeâ  he breakfasted after he came downâ  i remember a man named wilson  a clock case maker  calling that day to see my brotherâ  i think he called before twelve o clockâ  it was after my brother came downâ  he had some conversation with my brotherâ  i do not recollect upon what subjectâ  he left about three o clockâ  the dinner cloth was being laid while he staid thereâ  dinner was brought up while he was there  i thinkâ  he did not dine with usâ  he went away before dinnerâ  the servant i remember  in laying the cloth  had to ask him to move  in talking to my brother  to enable her to lay the clothâ  my brother dined with the rest of the family that dayâ  he went out in the evening  about five o clockâ  i can undertake to say he did not leave the house earlier than between four and five o clock  and that he was there from one to two or three o clockâ  he was not outtill between four and five o clock in the eveningâ  my brother edward and he slept togetherâ  the prisoner had supper at home that sunday nightâ  we usually supped between eleven and twelve o clock  about elevenâ  he came home earlyâ  i remarked his coming home particularly early that evening  but i do not know the hourâ  we went to bed at the usual hour that nightâ  next morning  monday  the 25th  he came down stairs a few minutes before nine o clock q  do you remember whether there was any thing particular to require his coining down stairs  a  yes  his boot maker called that morning  and was waiting for him to have an answer about his boots  which he had brought home on saturday nightâ  when he came down he spoke to the boot makerâ  he said he had not time to wait a momentâ  he came down with his coat over his arm  and his slippers onâ  he breakfasted at home that morningâ  he went out just about nine o clock court  q  then he only came down a few minutes before nine o clock  a  he came down just before nine o clock  but very often he used to take a cup of coffee and run awayâ  he did so that morningâ  he went away in a great hurryâ  it might be a few minutes before nine o clock when he left  but it was on the stroke of nineâ  my brother edward was in the habit of taking him a lunch every morningâ  he generally took it about ten or eleven o clock  but sometimes it was not so exactâ  i remember my father coming home on monday evening perfectly wellâ  he came home from eleven to half past eleven o clock  but not laterâ  i am quite sure of thatâ  he went to bed with the rest of the familyâ  i was ready on the last trial to state what i have nowâ  i had stated it to mr  yates  my brother s attorney cross examined bymr  bodkin  q  were you here in attendance during the trial  a  no  not on any of the daysâ  i was at homeâ  my father was at home with my brother on the sunday  talking to the said mr  wilsonâ  i did not know that my father was said to be in another place on that sundayâ  i knew he was described to be at moss s house on sundayâ  i knew he was at home q  why was it you did not come here to state it in the last case  a  because the counsellors did not think it necessary witnesses should be called  i understoodâ  mr  riddington is the master boot maker s nameâ  i do not know where my brother edward was when the man called from mr  riddingtonâ  the man waited in the parlourâ  my sister showed him inâ  i was thereâ  i called my brother for himâ  i went and told my brother that riddington s man was waiting for himâ  he came down on that  and went into the parlour to the manâ  that is the room he used to take his breakfast inâ  he did not talk to the man while he was having his break fast q  did he take any breakfast  a  he took a cup of coffee  as well as i can recollect  but he was very late that morningâ  he merely swallowed a cup of coffee and went out almost as soon as he got in the parlourâ  he told the man he could not wait to try them on that morning  and then left the house i think while the man was thereâ  i did not see my brother edward go out with the lunch that morningâ  i did not give him the lunchâ  we sometimes breakfasted before my brotherâ  sometimes we breakfasted earlier than he roseâ  on that morning we were breakfasting when he came downâ  the family were sitting at breakfast when he came downâ  myself  my mother  and edwardâ  we were having breakfast togetherâ  being late that morning  breakfastwas nearly done when riddington s man cameâ  edward and all the family were sitting at breakfast when i went up stairs to call my brotherâ  i left them at the breakfast table  but i must name to you  that we did not break fast in the parlour where riddington s man came in  but in another parlour mr  jones  q  was edward at breakfast with you and the family that morning  a  yesâ  i did not take any notice of what passed between my brother and riddington s manâ  at least i do not think he satisfied the man  he had not time to answer himâ  i was not at home in the middle of the day on mondayâ  i saw my father on monday morningâ  the latest time i saw him on monday morning was between ten and eleven o clock  i thinkâ  he was in the habit of attending to the shop throughout the day  unless he had occasion to go out court  q  what is his shop  a  a clock and watch manufactoryâ  my brother sometimes has a sandwich for his lunch  or sometimes bread and cheese  any thing there wasâ  he did not take it with himâ  edward used to take it to himâ  he very seldom took it himselfâ  he used to say he would do without any  but we nearly always used to send him lunch  and we used to send it as early as we could to himâ  john street is about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour s walkâ  we sent every dayâ  he never took it himselfâ  it was sent wrapped up in paper mr  jones  q  was the lunch generally sent by his direction  or through the anxiety of your mother  a  through the anxiety of my mother  for fear he should be faintâ  he said there was no occasion for it  and that was the reason he did not take it himself grace caspar  i am the sister of ellen caspar  i remember sunday  the 24th of marchâ  my brother got up about eleven o clock  or a little afterâ  he and edward slept togetherâ  he breakfasted when he came down that morningâ  while he was there mr  wilson called to see himâ  he is a draughtsman  and a clock case makerâ  it was between twelve and one o clock  about half past twelve o clock i think  when mr  wilson calledâ  he remained till the dinner cloth was laid  which was between three and four o clockâ  he went away before we dinedâ  from eleven till three o clock  when mr  wilson left  my brother did not leave the houseâ  he was not dressed to leave home till afterâ  he dined with us that day  and waited till five o clockâ  he agreed to wait for mr  wilson till five o clock  and if he did not call about five o clock  he was to go out without himâ  it must have have been after five o clock when he went outâ  i cannot recollect his coming home that eveningâ  i do not remember having supper that nightâ  i went to bed before supperâ  my brother might have returned before i went to bedâ  he generally supped with usâ  my father got up the same time as usual on sunday morningâ  he breakfasted with usâ  we breakfasted at eight o clock that morningâ  my father did not go out before dinner that dayâ  he was also engaged with mr  wilsonâ  i will undertake to say positively my father was at home between one and two o clock that dayâ  i do not remember any body calling to see my brother on monday morning  but the shoemaker  who lives oppositeâ  the man s name is allenâ  the master is mr  riddingtonâ  allen called about nine o clock  a few minutes before or after nine o clockâ  my brother came down to see himâ  he had his slippers on when he came down  and his coat thrown over his armâ  he spoke to the man  and tried the boots onâ  i cannot say whether they fitted him

longâ  my brother breakfasted after he had done with the manâ  he went out as near as i can recollect  at a quarter after nine o clock  a few minutes more or lessâ  it was past nine o clock i am

several times with the prisoner  but did not knew his surnameâ  i was sitting in the long roomâ  there were a great many people there  but not so many as there are sometimesâ  the room will hold sixty or seventyâ  i had been there from eight till ten o clockâ  the prisoner came in afterwards  and went into the third box down the room  after speaking to meâ  she came across the room when she first came inâ  i was sitting opposite the doorâ  she did not stop in the room many minutesâ  i have always said that she knocked me down firstâ  i do not exactly remember whether she said any thing when i pulled her nose  but she went out  and shifted her clothesâ  i said nothing to her when she came backâ  she said to me   now come out  you bâ  â  wâ  â    i will have it out of you now â  i do not recollect whether any body said to her   go and change your gown â  this is the deposition which i made my mark toâ   looking at it â  it was read over to meâ   the witness s deposition being ready represented the prisoner to have pulled her down before the left the room  and that it was half an hour before the returned  and upon getting to the door the said something which the witness did not hear â  i do not remember her saying any thing at the doorâ  he struck me three blows  the first on the nose  one on the side of my nice  and one on my lipâ  she went out first the second time she came inâ  she did not come in a third timeâ  she was turned out directly by the waiterâ  i went out ten minutes or a quarter of afterwardsâ  it was not more  i think it was not less than five minutesâ  i did an hour not go out at the same moment with herâ  i know toomeyâ  she was not present when the blow was struck with the key  nor yet till the key was taken out of the prisoner s handâ  my bonnet was offâ  the was standing on the first step of the door  and struck me as i was coming outâ  she had the key in her handâ  thomas was with me all this timeâ  she knocked me down  struck me twice with her fist  and then a third time  and was going to strike me again  when the key was taken out of her handâ  she then made the best of her way homeâ  i went next day to get a warrant  but the magistrate told me to go to the station house  and get a policemanâ  i went to the station house by the magistrate s order  got the inspector to let an officer go with me  and he found the prisoner getting over the wall susan thomas  i live in new gravel lane  on the 8th of april i was in company with the prosecutrix at the king william public houseâ  she sat by the side of a sailor who had been stopping with the prisoner some nightsâ  i had seen him frequently with herâ  he treated the prosecutrix to some rumâ  the prisoner seeing that called her names not fit to mentionâ  the prosecutrix got up in a few minutes  and went and wrung her nose as hard as she couldâ  i tried to prevent her doing it  and fetched her up the room  away from the prisonerâ  the prisoner went out in about ten minutes  and returned in about ten minutes with a cotton gown on  having had a black silk one on beforeâ  the prosecutrix and i were coming up the room  and the prisoner struck her  knocked her down  and told her to come out and fightâ  i said she should not  for she was too drunk to fightâ  one of the waiters then came  and put the prisoner outâ  in about ten minutes perkins came and told me supper was readyâ  i said   very well  help me lead the prosecutrix out   which she did  and before we could get her off the second step of the door  the prisoner struck her with the key of the door  and never spoke to herâ  she was outsideâ  she struck her on the nose the first blowâ  altogether she struck her two or three timesâ  she never spoke at allâ  she struck her on the lip the second time  and i said   why  mary  you have a key in your hand â  i either called her mary or pollâ  i wrenched the key out of her handâ  this is the keyâ   looking at it â  she struck her with the ward partâ  i have every reason to believe she was waiting outside the door for herâ  she had been out of the house about ten minutesâ  the prosecutrix s face bled very fast indeed cross examined  q  you have had some conversation with the prosecutrix since  a  yesâ  i have not told her what i said before the magistrate  not to my recollectionâ  i was in the room all the timeâ  the prosecutrix went in with me about eight o clockâ  the prisoner came in between ten and eleven o clockâ  i believe the first words began a little before eleven o clockâ  the prisoner called her a bâ  â  cow  not a rotten cow  in my bearingâ  i sat close alongside of herâ  the prisoner was not going out of the room  and the prosecutrix following herâ  the did not say  when she returned in her cotton frock  that she was ready to fight her thenâ  she stood with her back against a fruit basket  struck her  and knocked her downâ  i took her upâ  i said nothing to the prisonerâ  i did not hear pearson say   there is no law for pulling noses or kicking       i was in company with pearson from first to lastâ  i might have left her a minuteâ  she and the prisoner were not going out to fightâ  pearson did not try to hit her after they got out of the houseâ  the first of the scuffle was the prisoner s trying to hit her with the keyâ  pearson laid hold of the sleeves of her gown  that is allâ  the prisoner did not say in my hearing   i don t wish to fight with keys â  when pearson got up she was bleeding from the faceâ  she was struck down by mr  talbot s windowâ  she fell in the kennel  about the middle of that windowâ  there is no step where she fellâ  she was knocked down by a blow in the face from the prisonerâ  she did not fall on the curb stone  she fell in the gutter  close to the curbâ  she did not say   i will make your browns come out â  they did not both fall together into the kennelâ  the prisoner dragged her to the second house  and then knocked her down in talbot passage  and was repeating the blows till she was taken off by me and perkinsâ  i did not tell pearson she was bleedingâ  i said to perkins   look how her face is bleeding â  i did not hear pearson say   never mind a little blood  it will not hurt me   but icould not notice all the words  i was in a flurryâ  pearson tore the sleeves of the prisoner s gown as she laid hold of them  when she fell  to prevent her falling  and both her sleeves came outâ  the prisoner fell on her hannah perkins  i live with the last witness  i went to the king william public house between eleven and twelve o clock  to tell her that supper was readyâ  i assisted pearson out of the houseâ  i did not observe the prisoner till she struck pearson  which she did with a key  and repeated the blowâ  thomas got the key from her afterwardsâ  pearson fell on her back afterwards with the blows the prisoner gave herâ  the prisoner was still beating her when i and thomas went and took her from her cross examined  q  the prisoner struck the blow without saying any thing  a  she didâ  it was a violent blowâ  thomas took the key after the blow had been repeated twice  as far as i recollectâ  the prisoner then caught hold of pearson s hair  dragged her into the second house  knocked her down in the passage  and beat herâ  i took her from her  and said   liverpool poll  don t hit her down â  i did not see the prisoner when i went into the public house  not till i came out with the prosecutrixâ  i did not see her as i went in at the doorâ  there was a scuffling going down to tolbot s houseâ  they had no fight  pearson was too much in liquor to strike at allâ  she did not lift her hand to the prisonerâ  pearson fell twice  the first time was in the road  on her back  and the next time in the passage of the houseâ  she did not fall on the curb stoneâ  i did not hear her say   never mind a little blood  it won t hurt me â  i certainly should have heard it if she had said soâ  i will swear the did not say soâ  i did not hear it mentioned george hale  police constable k 54   i apprehended the prisoner on the 9thâ  she said it was not done with a keyâ  there were a great many girls there at the time  and they said   oh  you did not do it  she did it in falling â  i said   i think it was not done in falling â  she said   yes  it was   that the prosecutrix was very drunk  and did it herself in falling cross examined  q  did you find the prisoner immediately you went after her  a  no  i did not  because they go from one house to another soâ  i took her in one of the houses  not the house she lived in john william bird  i am a surgeon  and live in ratcliff highway  the prosecutrix was brought to me on the night of wednesday  the 8th  to have her face dressedâ  her nose was cut across  at least it was dividedâ  the bridge was broken  and her lip divided in two placesâ  they were contused wounds  not such as a person would receive by a fall in the streetâ  there are three distinct woundsâ  the one across the nose is a transverse one  the other longitudinal  and the other obliqueâ  the cut on the upper lip was oblique and fiat over  so that the force must have been applied upwards  and there is an excoriation on the nose upwards  which would not occur in a fallâ  it was certainly not done by falling on the groundâ  this key would produce such appearancesâ  it must have been applied with considerable violenceâ  the wounds correspond with the key  and the key is stained with blood now cross examined  q  if a person fell against the curb stone  might not that cut the lip  and break the teeth  a  not in that wayâ  such a thing is possible  but the wounds were all in different directionsâ  i was not told what had been the matter when she was brought to meâ  she and the two young women came  and they were all enraged of course witnesses for the defence william marshall  i am a baker  and live in new gravel laneâ  mr  talbot is my master  on the 8th of april  between ten and eleven o

followed herâ  the prosecutrix fell down on the curb without any body touching herâ  she came running up against the prisonerâ  there were three or four persons coming outâ  the prosecutrix ran up to the prisoner to make a blow at her  and fell down on the curbâ  i saw thomas lift her up court  q  did the prosecutrix come out of the house quietly by herself  or was she lifted along  a  she walked out aloneâ  nobody helping her on one side or the otherâ  i was first asked to be a witness to dayâ  i do not know who applied to meâ  i was at work  and one of the witnesses came up for meâ  i do not know her nameâ  i do not know any of their names mary ann toomey  i am single  and live in new gravel lane  last wednesday night  between ten and eleven o clock  i was in the long room at the king

prisoner said nothing to herâ  the waiter came up and said he would not have a row there  and the prisoner went outside the doorâ  the prosecutrix followed her out  and going out  pulled her cap and

prisoner  and thomas said   don t strike  she has got a key in her hand â  the prisoner said   i don t want to hit with the key  you can take the key   and gave it to her out of her bosomâ  she then struck her  and both fell down on the curbâ  they were both the worse for liquorâ  thoomas said   your face is bloody â  she said   never mind a little blood  it will do me no harm â  they fell to fighting again  and fell into mr  talbot s passage  and when she got up she was all over blood court  q  when the prosecutrix called her these bad names nobody struck then  a  noâ  the prosecutrix

the prosecutrix came out presently afterâ  they were both the worse for liquorâ  the prisoner did not change her gownâ  she had a very nice dark silk gown onâ  she did not go away for a short time

servantâ  the prisoner had gone home thenâ  i did not hear her call pearson a bâ  rotten cowâ  i should have heard it if she hadâ  i never heard her say any bad words to her  she only told her not to

my room â  there was not an interval of ten minutes between her being taken out  and being found outsideâ  the prisoner had a light frock on when she had the key  but when she first came in she had a black silk dress onâ  she was told to go home and change her dress  that the prosecutrix might not hurt her thingsâ  she only slipped on her light dress  and came back again  and the prosecutrix insulted her againâ  thomas took the prisoner s apron off  and tore the sleeves off her gown  and said   this will do for the bâ  to morrow â  the prosecutrix said she would make the bâ  sport her

    "Something to consider when looking at sentiment, outside of just general polarity like we did in the last section, people can create specialized dictionaries containing specific words of interest to try to analyze sentiment from a particular angle. One organization, the [Moral Foundations Theory](http://moralfoundations.org/), took this approach and we will now use it to see if we can understand Old Bailey's sentiment better. You should be doing something like this for your homework. We will be using a provided moral foundations dictionary."
