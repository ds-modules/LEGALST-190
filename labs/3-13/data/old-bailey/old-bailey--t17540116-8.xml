               <p>John Jervas. I let a ready-furnish'd lodging to the prisoner the 6th of last month. She went away the 13th in the evening; not returning, I went into the room the next day, and missed the goods mentioned in the indictment, [ naming them all over.] I took up the prisoner, and charged her with taking the things; she told me where they were, saying she had sold some, and pawned the rest, and by her direction I went and found the curtains, blankets, vallens, saucepan, and looking glass, at Mr. Shilingworth's, in Water-lane, Black-friars, where she had sold them; he delivered them to me. The sheets, candlesticks, flat irons and teakettle were at a pawnbroker's and were deliver'd to me also.</p>
