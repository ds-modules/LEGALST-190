I lost a saw about a month or five weeks ago; it was a long saw: it was taken away from out of my yard: I saw it about two days before it was lost. I found it upon Thomas Quick, he had bought it: he lives in Whitechapel, near the church, and I live near the turnpike; this was about three or four days after I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks were on it?</p>
               <p>Sharp. The maker's name Billicom, and by a slaw that was on it, about the middle. I had bought it last summer, it cost me thirty shillings; I took up the prisoner as soon as I found he had sold it to Quick. He said, he bought it of some body, and that he had sold it to Quick.</p>

            . The Prisoner brought the saw into my father's house about six weeks ago, and said the owner was in trouble and afraid to come out of doors, and had sent him to sell the saw. He would not tell me where the man was; so I bought it for twelve shillings: I gave him six shillings and sixpence in part, and was willing to see the owner before I paid him the other. The next day I made an inquiry about it, and found out the owner.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a saw was it?</p>
               <p>Quick. It was a long saw, the maker's name Bellicom; Mr. Sharp claimed it as his property, and it was delivered to him.</p>

            . I was by when the Prisoner brought the saw to sell to Quick. Quick and the Prisoner worked together. The Prisoner said, the man must have the saw or money that night, so it was agreed they were to have it between them, and Quick gave him his half of the money.</p>
