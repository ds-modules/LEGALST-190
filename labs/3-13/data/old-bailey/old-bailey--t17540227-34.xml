When I came down I missed the hen; I then went and called up an officer of the peace, and we went to search the Prisoner's house, (he lives just by me;) when we went in, there was the pot over the fire, and the feathers of the hen down by him on the floor. We then looked about to see whether we could find her or no; while we were looking, the Prisoner took this iron, producing it, (which was a poker) and struck me about, so that I was forced to go out of the house; when I came back again with a stronger guard the Prisoner was gone off.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you swear to the feathers of your hen?</p>
               <p>Starkey. They were very much like them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you upon your oath say he took the hen?</p>
               <p>Starkey. No, I cannot, because I could not find it; but I would venture to take my oath this iron (which was the same poker) broke the door open; for when it was put into the marks made in wrenching the door it fitted exactly, and is bent with the strain.</p>

            . The Prisoner came and called under my chamber-window at two o'clock in the morning: he called my husband twice and me once, I was awake at that time, my husband was not. Presently afterwards my neighbours called out, that Saunders was breaking the doors open, and that they heard the hen cry; with that I awaked my husband, and he got up and went down stairs directly; as soon as he came down stairs the Prisoner was gone.</p>
