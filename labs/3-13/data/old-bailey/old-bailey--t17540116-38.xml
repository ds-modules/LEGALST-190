               <p>Riley. I had nailed up boards against it, because I would not pay window-light, which were pulled down. This was a lodging room, where sometimes I have laid. There were three sucking pigs, which I had bought the night before, taken away, and going to the place where I keep my sows for breeding, I found the lock of that door broke. I was informed by a person near me, that his lodgers had been out all night, who were Irons and the evidence Price; upon which I took up Price, and he confessed the whole. I went on the Monday following to the White Hart in White-Chapel, where he said they were sold, and there I was informed it was truth.</p>

            . The two prisoners and I had been together at an alehouse in Goswell-Street till about four o'clock, on the 16th of December; they both asked me to go along with them, and we all went to the prosecutor's house. Richford and I went over into the yard, and Irons staid by the pales. We broke open one place, where were three hogs; then we went to the window of the house, and Richford pulled away the boards that were nailed up against it, pushed away the straw that was tucked in, and put me into the room, where I found three sucking pigs, which I took and gave to him, and he to Irons. One of the pigs was given away. We were all three together when Richford sold two for a shilling and a full pot of beer each; one to a carman, and another to a woman. Richford asked us to go first of all, for we did not know where the pigs were.</p>
