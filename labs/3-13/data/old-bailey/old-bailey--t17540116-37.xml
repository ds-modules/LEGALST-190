We were together, and upon his asking if we would have a pint of wine, the prisoner went down for it. After this he clapped down his hand, and said he had lost his watch; he went down and told the woman that he had lost his watch.

After they had had some talk, we went all three together to a house. When we came there he asked if we had such a thing as rods? I went down and asked the gentlewoman if she had any, and she had a whisk. After that he desired me to lie down on the bed with him, and the other girl and he asking me to go down for a pint of wine, when I came up again, there lay the watch on the bed, and his breeches were down.</p>
