            , I live in Crutched-Friars, the prisoner had lived with me about five weeks; I took her in out of charity. I was to go to Humerton last Saturday, and the prisoner was to go with me. She went out, and took the bundle which I had given her a strict order not to take with her, I designing to take it in the coach. I was to take her up at the turnpike, but she did not stay there, or come near me in the country. On the Sunday morning I had information she was taken by my son, and at my London house. I went to her, and charged her with taking the things, which she owned, and said that some she had pawned, and some given away.</p>
