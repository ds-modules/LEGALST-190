After that Price came in, Perry asked him to let us go to his house; we went, and he and she were together at one end of the room a good while. He was very much fuddled. After which Perry and I went to the Two Brewers in St. Giles's. where they came and took us, had us to Mr. Flanerkin's the constable, and there searched us. I said to Perry, if you have the watch, give it him; she replied, you fool, the soldier has got it; upon whic h he delivered it. The bill was found ignoramus at Hicks's Hall against Perry, which was intended for me, but they mistook the prisoner for me.</p>
