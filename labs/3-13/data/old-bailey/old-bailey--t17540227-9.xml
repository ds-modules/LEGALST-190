            . I was night constable in Bristol when the Prisoner was convicted there. I saw her tried there, it is near five years ago, for picking one farmer Hewit's pocket. I saw her when she received sentence of death, and after that I was there present when she was on her knees and desired his Majesty's pardon, and saw her receive sentence of transportation for fourteen years. On the 18th of December last I had business in London, and coming down Bridges-street, I there saw the Prisoner at large; I apprehended her, and took her before justice Fielding, and she was committed.</p>
