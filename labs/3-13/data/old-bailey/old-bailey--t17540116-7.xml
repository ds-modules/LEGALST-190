            . I live at Twickenham, and was sent for by the prosecutor to Reading, as I had lost a mare at the same time. I went, and saw the prisoner there in the Compter. Coming from thence I saw Sandey the younger come gallopping hard up the town on the prosecutor's mare. The prosecutor came, and he, I, and Sandey, went to the prisoner, there they both charged him with stealing the mare; but the prisoner said he bought her, and owned he sold her to Sandey; and Sandey said he gave him six guineas for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who he bought her of?</p>
               <p>Hide. He said he bought her of the man that lived at the George at Old Brentford. But I knew there was no such sign there. The prisoner had got my mare there, at the Black Horse, which I had again.</p>

I knowing her, said, I would see and enquire after her, and if I could hear of her, would send him word. I put up at the Bull at Sceal, and saw the prisoner riding on the prosecutor's mare. I was not near enough to speak to him, but knew the mare very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Davis. No. I never saw him before in my life, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he going?</p>
               <p>Davis. He rode out of an inn yard, and on towards Reading; I went to the house, and asked the hostler, if he knew the man who had just rode out; he said, he did not. I then got a person to write a letter to the prosecutor, to let him know where I had seen the mare.</p>
