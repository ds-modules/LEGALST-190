            . The Prisoner was brought into my house by three people at the coach and horses, in Great Marlborough-street, on a Saturday, the latter end of last month; the Prisoner had chair'd for me five years. I asked her, what made her do such a wicked action, as she was accused<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175402270016"></xptr> with, she said, because she was much in liquor. I asked her, if I should fetch the gentlewoman's daughter, for her to talk to: I fetched her. The Prisoner said to her, she would work for her as long as she lived, 'till she had worked it out. I left them together. After which the Prisoner said to me, if I would go along with her and no body else, she would go and fetch the two stars. I did not think proper to go along with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she produce the stars?</p>
               <p>Bullion. No; I never saw or heard that she did. I always had a good opinion of her before this.</p>
