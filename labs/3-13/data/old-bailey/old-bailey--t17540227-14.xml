            , the prisoner came into our shop to buy three quarters of a yard of ribbon for a watch. There was a man came with her, but he staid on the step of the door. I shewed her some ribbon, and she found fault with the colour. I shewed her some others, and then she went to the man and asked him if it was to be dark blue ribbon. Then she asked for a halfpenny worth of green silk. After she was gone out I missed the piece of mazarine blue. Upon which I immediately sent after the man, who ran away, and so did she; but she was taken and brought back. I asked her to produce the ribbon, but she denied having it. She had a little child with her about six years of age, who said to her, mamma, it is in your lap. We sent for a constable, and searched her, but did not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of it?</p>
               <p>C. Johnson. I cannot exactly tell the number of yards, but can safely say there was above six yards of it.</p>

[She confirmed the testimony of her mamma, with this addition, that she saw the prisoner, whilst her mamma was reaching the green silk, slide the piece of mazarine blue ribbon into her lap from off the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175402270013"></xptr> counter, and that she asked the man whether it should b e dark green ribbon, and he said yes.]</p>
