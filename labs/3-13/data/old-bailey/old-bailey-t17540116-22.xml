            . I met with the two prisoners on the 15th of January, about four in the morning, in Russel-Street, near a night cellar, where I was going to drink. Moreover, there was a young fellow with them, who asked me where I was going, and I told him. Moreover, the girls asked me to give them something to drink; I said they should be welcome. Moreover, we had a pot of hot on the steps, for the people would not let Brown go into the cellar. We then went to Mr. Tooley's in <placeName id="t17540116-22-crimeloc123">Covent-Garden</placeName>
