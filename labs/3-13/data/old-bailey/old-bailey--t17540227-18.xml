I followed him, and saw him slip something into his pocket. Then he crossed the way again, and I still followed him. He stopped in Grocer's Alley, but I desired him to go on, and said I did not care to trust him behind me but he refused so to do, and then I said to him, I believe you have got my handkerchief. He ran as hard as he could; I cried out; stop thief, he was stopped in the Old Jury, and near the place where he was stopped the handkerchief was found. [Produced in court and deposed to.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrot. I was in the Old Jury on Friday was se'nnight, and heard the cry, stop thief. Mr. Wright who was with me stopped the prisoner at the bar, and assistants that followed laid hold on him. The prosecutor said he had lost a handkerchief, and I observed something like one fly and drop as the prisoner was stopped; upon which I went to the place and took up this handkerchief which the prosecutor has swore to.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say the handkerchief dropped from the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Barrot. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wright confirmed the account given by the last evidence.</p>

               <p>I was coming by the Mansion-house, thinking no harm, I went down the Old Jury, and took no notice of any body, and turned into a lane going my direct way home; this gentleman came quick after me, I made room for him to come by, but he said you have got my handkerchief, and struck me on my head. I said what is that for? he said he would tell me presently. I ran for some body to assist me, then he called out, stop thief. I was so stunned by the blow I did not know which way I ran, and they stopped me and dragged me about.</p>
