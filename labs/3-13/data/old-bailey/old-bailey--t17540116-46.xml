On the 15th of January, between five and six o'clock I was drinking tea with my mother, and heard somethin g fall; I thought the cat might have thrown something down, so I went up stairs, and then I heard somebody before me; I came down, and still I heard such a noise as I did before, but coming after me. I turned and went up again, and then heard the noise going higher; I went up to the garret, and at the head of the stairs stood the prisoner, who made an attempt to push me backwards. I ran down and he after me; I took up the fireshovel, struck him over the head, and he bled very much. He ran out, but was apprehended under a cart, and brought in. After this I went up to the garret, there were the things mentioned in the indictment tied up in a handkerchief, but the handkerchief I know nothing of. Produced in Court, and deposed to.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. There was a man amongst the mob, who said the man that came down stairs was in blue, but he looked as if he belonged to the prisoner. The prisoner is the man, and was all bloody from the blow I gave him when he was brought in again.</p>
