            . I am a journeyman to Mr. Winter, a clothworker. On the 22d of December I went to the Cock and Magpye, a publick house. The two prisoners at the bar brought in this piece of woollen cloth, which they had in a basket, and offered to sell it to any body in the house. A piece was produced, which Mr. Barnet deposed to as the property of Mr. Howel. I went and looked on the cloth, and asking the price of it,

I suspected by the price it was not honestly come by, so gave her a shilling to bind the bargain, till I could get a constable to take them up. I went out to see for one, but not being able to find him, I then went to a justice of peace, who was not at home, but the clerk telling me that I might take him up myself on suspicion, I went back and told the old woman, if they could make a proper title to it, I'd give her the money before the justice. She was willing to go along with me. I carried them to the constable's house under a pretence to have a pint of beer. He was then at home, and I charged him with them.</p>
