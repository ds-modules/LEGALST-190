I charged him with stealing my handkerchief, upon which he immediately ran away, but was taken. There was an evidence saw him drop the handkerchief, but he is now ill in bed. I carried him before Justice Fielding, who sent me back with him into the city, the fact being committed there. Coming along he pulled out a knife, and swore he would stick me if I would not let him go. He got away, but I knocked him down, and retook him again, and took up the knife, [producing it in court] the prisoner said if ever he got his liberty, and could meet me in an open field, he would make fine sport with me.</p>
