I was holding the wardmote on St. Thomas's day. I was taking the poll, and my hat, which I have under my arm, was then hanging up. The poll was closed at two; during the time of it the prisoner came in, and my hat was taken from him; which is all I know. I did not see him take it; he behaved as if he did not know what he did, and I did not take him to be in his senses.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner knock the hat off a peg, as it was hanging that day; after which he put his own on his head, and the other under his coat. We let him go as far as the door that leads into Salters-hall yard. We then carried him back, and took the hat from under his coat. When the alderman said he must commit him, he talked as if he was not in his senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sober?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. He was not fuddled.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going to return the hat to the place from whence I took it.</p>
               <p>Hambleton. He was not. He was going out with it till we made him come back.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never was charged with a criminal action before in my life, and believe it will be made to appear that I have behaved with decency, and kept the best of company, that I was not given to liquor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175401160033"></xptr> or bad language; and I think nobody ever behaved with more modesty, both in public and private conversation.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner twenty years, but never knew him guilty of an ill thing in my life. About seven years ago he collected a great deal of money for me, and did his business very faithfully.</p>
               <p>Q. How has his behaviour been of late?</p>
               <p>Dale. For this year or two I have seldom seen him. I believe he has not been in his senses these seven years last past.</p>
