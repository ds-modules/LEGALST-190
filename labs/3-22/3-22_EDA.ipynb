    "> \"It is important to understand what you CAN DO before you learn to measure how WELL you seem to have done it.\" -John W. Tukey, *Exploratory Data Analysis*\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous labs and many introductory data analysis classes like Data-8 focus on **Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)**: the use of statistical methods to see whether the data supports a given hypothesis or model. But, where does the hypothesis come from in the first place?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of 'looking at data to see what it seems to say'. Through this process, we hope to accomplish several things:\n",
    "- learn about the overall 'shape' of the data: structure, organization, ranges of values\n",
    "- assess what assumptions we can make about the data as a basis for later statistical inference\n",
    "- figure out the appropriate tools and techniques for analysis \n",
    "- tentatively create testable, appropriate hypotheses or models\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is complementary to CDA- in fact, CDA is often only possible after having done EDA. This is clear when compared to the methods of natural sciences: a scientist's research starts with making observations about the world, which leads to questions about what they see. Only after observing and wondering can we begin to systematically test our hypotheses. Similarly, every data analysis project you do should begin with EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll go through the EDA process for speech transcripts from [2016 US Presidential campaigns](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election.php). You'll use many coding skills from previous labs. And because EDA is an exploratory process, there are many ways to approach the code (we'll give some tips and guidance). "
