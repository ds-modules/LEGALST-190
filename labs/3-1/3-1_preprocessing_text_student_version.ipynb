For instance, a determiner (e.g. an article like \"the\") could be concatenated onto the noun that follows it. If there's an adjective between them, we can include that too.\n",

NLTK provides a RegexpParser that takes as input a grammar composed of regular expressions (which define patterns in text, we'll learn it in later labs). The grammar is defined as a string, with one line for each rule we define. Each rule starts with the label we want to assign to the chunk (e.g. NP for \"noun phrase\"), followed by a colon, then an expression in regex-like notation that will be matched to tokens' POS (part-of-speech) tags.\n",
