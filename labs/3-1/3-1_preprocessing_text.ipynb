    "We may want to work with larger segments of text than single words (but still smaller than a sentence). For instance, in the sentence \"The black cat climbed over the tall fence\", we might want to treat \"The black cat\" as one thing (the subject), \"climbed over\" as a distinct act, and \"the tall fence\" as another thing (the object). The first and third sequences are noun phrases, and the second is a verb phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can separate these phrases by \"chunking\" the sentence, i.e. splitting it into larger chunks than individual tokens. This is also an important step toward identifying entities, which are often represented by more than one word. You can probably imagine certain patterns that would define a noun phrase, using part of speech tags. For instance, a determiner (e.g. an article like \"the\") could be concatenated onto the noun that follows it. If there's an adjective between them, we can include that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define rules about how to structure words based on their part of speech tags, we use a grammar (in this case, a \"chunk grammar\"). NLTK provides a RegexpParser that takes as input a grammar composed of regular expressions (which define patterns in text, we'll learn it in later labs). The grammar is defined as a string, with one line for each rule we define. Each rule starts with the label we want to assign to the chunk (e.g. NP for \"noun phrase\"), followed by a colon, then an expression in regex-like notation that will be matched to tokens' POS (part-of-speech) tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a single rule for a noun phrase like this. The rule allows 0 or 1 determiner, then 0 or more adjectives, and finally at least 1 noun. (By using 'NN.*' as the last POS tag, we can match 'NN', 'NNP' for a proper noun, or 'NNS' for a plural noun.) If a matching sequence of tokens is found, it will be labeled 'NP'."
