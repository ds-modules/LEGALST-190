                  Gregory 
               



            . On the 10th of January I was coming over Devonshire Square, about 12 at Night; the prisoner ask'd if I would go with her, I being pretty much in liquor, went with her into a private room, in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch


. There was a person who brought us a quartern of liquor, and no body else in the room but the prisoner and I: I staid there about 10 minutes. I miss'd my watch when I was but about 10 yards from the house; however I went home. The next evening I went with a friend or two to the place, and we found the prisoner at a publick house. I charg'd a Constable with her, and sent her to the Compter; and went the next day before the Alderman at Guild-hall. She owned she had the Watch, and gave it to 
               
                  Solomon 
                  Lewis 
               



            , a Jew; and said, if I would not prosecute her she would give it me again.


                  George 
                  Wardling 
               



            , and 
               
                  Henry 
                  Keys 
               



             confirmed this confession of the prisoner.



               Guilty
             of Felony.
