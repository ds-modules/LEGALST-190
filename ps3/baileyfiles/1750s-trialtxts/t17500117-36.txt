            . I belong to the Birmingham Waggon
, I came into the Yard where it was, at the Sarazen's Head, on Snow-hill


; I heard somebody in the Waggon; the prisoner jumped out of it, tumbled down, and I catched hold of him, and we had a struggle there; the Hostler came and assisted me, so we took him into the Tap-house. I had left the Waggon about 7 o'clock, with these Goods all in it, and this was between 8 and 9 o'clock. I was taking care of the prisoner when the Things were found.

             with me; there I saw a box marked I. W. lying at the tail of the waggon, with two tea-kettles and stands in it; and upon a bulk that was four foot high, there were lying a new pair of boots, the tops of them lined with red, a pair of shag breeches, and the prisoner's hat along with them; the prisoner ask'd for his hat; I told him he should have it another time: I ask'd him how it came upon the bulk? he said it was lost in the struggle with Hipkiss, which is a thing impossible. The hat was given to the prisoner at Guild-hall.
Q. to Hipkiss. When did you see these goods last, before they were removed from the waggon?
Hipkiss. I loaded the waggon at Birmingham ; they were part of the loading: I saw them in the waggon at 7 o'clock that night.
