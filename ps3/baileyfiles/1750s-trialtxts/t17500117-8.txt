            . I am a carman. I had this portmanteau, with three other parcels, in my cart, going from the Spread Eagle in Grace-Church-Street, to this lady's house in Cavendish-Square, and in the Strand, I stopped at the One Tun alehouse


 to give my horses some water: I saw my tail rope cut, and the portmanteau on the prisoner's back; I followed him about thirty yards, and took hold on the flap of his coat ; he flung it off backwards upon me, and knocked me down; he ran away, and 
               
                  John 
                  Forster 
               



             followed him; I staid with the portmanteau, and never saw him till Forster brought him back. We carried him and the portmanteau to justice Frazer's ; and the prosecutrix's servant came there that night, it had a direction on it to the prosecutrix's house.


                  John 
                  Forster 
               



            . I went along with the cart with 
               
                  William 
                  May 
               



            . We stopped at the One-Tun in the Strand: I was in the house; I put the curtain by, and saw the prisoner with the portmanteau on his back, and called out. I saw him drop it on 
               
                  William 
                  May 
               



            : I was near him; so I pursued him, and never lost sight of him, I was all the way within six yards of him, or thereabouts, till I took him in Round Court; this was about a quarter of an hour before seven at night; it was a dark night.
Q. to May. How could you see the prisoner at this time, it being very dark?
May. There are many lamps about where the cart stood, and I saw him very plain.



               Guilty
            . Felony.
