            . I was coming along Cheapside


, on Friday was 7-night, about one o'clock in the morning; the prisoner at the bar, and another woman, met me: They us'd me in a very odd manner, and wanted drams of me; I told them it was a wrong time of the night to get a dram: However, they immediately call'd a woman from over the way, that sold drams; and, I believe, I might give them a dram, in order to get rid of them. I went from them, and I saw them following me: they came up with me, and began pulling me about, saying, I should go along with this and the other. I clapp'd my hand to my pocket, and miss'd my watch; I thought I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket, I laid hold on her, and the other ran away.
Q. Was you not in liquor ?
Stokes. I cannot say that I was quite drunk: I had been drinking. The whole affair was transacted in four minutes, I believe.
Q. Did not you give another woman a dram at that place, that night, besides these two?
Stokes. I might for ought I know; I cannot tell. I charged the Constable with her, she pleaded ignorance, as such people generally do. I never found my watch again.
