            . On Monday night, the first of January, I was coming over London-bridge with a hamper on my shoulder, full of men's wearing apparel: At the corner of St. Magnus Church, there were the prisoner, two men, and a woman; he walked in the middle of them. I push'd by them; but had not got above 10 yards over Thames street


, coming up the hill, before I heard my keys in my pocket chink, and putting my hand down, felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket. I had in that pocket with the keys, one stocking and a handkerchief. I held him fas the hand ; there was a light, over the way, at a fish monger's; I set my hamper down, and he desir'd to be searched. A gentleman coming by, bade me carry him to a constable; I said, I was afraid of losing my hamper ; said he, I'll be security for that. I charged a Constable with him, and he was sent to the Compter ; and the next day he was examined before Sir 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Hankey 
               



            . None of the things have been found again.



               Guilty
