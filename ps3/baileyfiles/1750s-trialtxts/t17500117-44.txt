Francis Hall. Coming up Ludgate-street


, Dec. 11, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, a gentleman said, Sir, your pocket is pick'd: I felt and my handkerchief was gone. Said he, that fellow has it, pointing to the prisoner. I laid hold of him, and searched him; and while I was searching him, it fell behind him, and a Man behind him took it up and gave it to me. When I was carrying him to the Constable, he swore and said, d - n you, if you don't let me go, and if you do prosecute me, you shall have your brains beat out before four days are at an end; and also it I would forgive him, he would own it.
