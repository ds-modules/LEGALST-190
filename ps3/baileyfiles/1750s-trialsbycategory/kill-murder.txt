upon him altogether beating him some with sticks some with their fists and treading upon him They had all sticks I said for God s sake don t murder my husband then they knock d me down in the mud with a great rail I saw the prisoner strike my husband as well as the other s I went to a neighbour s house to call help my husband then had scuffled out of the mud and two of them were upon him The prisoner was not one of them Then by intreaties they became a little easy and they came into my house and call d for a pot of beer and Squire Martin came with his pistols and some people and surrounded them saying if they would not be civil he would shoot them My husband went to Bow-street Covent-garden he could not come home being forc d to be put to bed there and was obliged to come home in a Coach One of his eyes was almost torn out of his head his head face neck and breast was bruis d and very black he complained much of inward pain There was a black spot on his breast where I suppose one of them had trod upon him He was attended by one Mr Greenwood an Apothecary He began complaining from the same night and never was well afterwards before he was a very healthy man I never knew him to all any thing crve an hour s illness since he was my husband Q Do you really believe he died of the wounds and bruises he received that night Mary Bradley I really do believe it his head was swell d almost as big as three and his eye tore in a terrible manner about an hour before he died he sent for a neighbour one Philip Lumpley that he might declare what he had to say he came and said how do you do Mr Bradley My husband made answer and said never worse but I hope I shall be better soon Said he do you think this is owing to the blows you got from those Gentlemen for said he I believe you are a dying man do you lay it to any one in particular Said he I lay it to one and all and added pray be so good as to see them brought to justice that I may be righted About an hour after which he turn d himself and died Q Did he spit any blood Mary Bradley He began to spit blood on the wednesday following and after that it became like a spungy matter of all manner of colours I shewed the pot to Mr Greenwood who said he never saw a man spit such like before His belly was swell d and he complained of pains and aches all over him Upon his spitting of blood I asked the apothecary where it came from said he where do you think but from the bruises your husband has receiv d Dorothy Gains I lodged in the deceased s house I was in my own room the 10th of December and he was sitting smoaking his pipe below those people came and knock d at the window shutter then at the door as if they would break it Mr Bradley opened the door and said gentlemen what do you want I was come down stairs and was then behind his back There was a little fellow a Baker said d - n you for a son of a b - h I ll let you know and he instantly knock d Mr Bradley down and broke his stick on the side of his face there were the other five men behind about five yards from the door Mr Bradley recovered himself and being a strong hail haroy man went to strike the man again and went to the middle of the road they all come up and struck him and knock d him down again they had all sticks and he nothing in his hands They all struck him I know every one of them I took the Candle and looked at them one by one after they came into the house The prisoner had a stick in his hand The tall fellow James Parkinson said if they were taken they were dead men they were all surrounded and carried to the Justice They put about a pound of Candles in the fire and were for fighting in the house I saw Mr Bradley every day after this She described his branks the same or worse than the former Witness sash his head would hardly go into a peck measure his spitting corruption &c &c She said the prisoner at the was the civilest of them all and that Jemmy Parkinson and the Baker were the Death of the deceased Cross Examined Q Did you tell the same before the Coroner you do now Gains No the Coroner would not hear me I believe he was see d he made a laughing at me and stopp d me and so did the gentlemen that sat by him Philip Lantley deposed he went three or four times to see the deceased in his Illness and confirm d what the Widow had sworn as to his dying words and that he complained much about his breast stomach and head and that he saw him when he was dead and he was very black about his shoulders head breast and neck he also said the prisoner behaved the best of the six persons Eliz Ridley I live in the neighbourhood those six persons knock d at my door that very night we let them all go by we stood a little while and we heard murder cry d we went out and went to the first Red Lyon and there we heard there were a heap of young men beating Mr Bradley I saw the deceased the next day after he came back from the justice his head was swelled he was terribly bruised about the face and said he was extream bad I went to see him two or three days after he said he could eat nothing at all I saw him in his illness I believe ten times sometimes I thought he would recover and sometimes I thought he would not I said a week before he died he would not live he seemed to heave and could hardly fetch his breath which he said was from an inward bruise I did not observe his spitting Francis Gains I am husband to the witness Dorothy I came home that night and I saw the deceased going with Squire Martin towards home in a very bad condition his eye almost torn out he complained always after of inwards pains and spit blood and corruption afterwards this I observed till within two or three days of his death I saw him that very night he died and heard him say his death proceeded from those six men beating of him He said several times to his wife make yourself easy and I hope in God those fellows will be made to suffer and after he was dead I saw conjealed blood round his neck and on his breast I wanted to have been heard before the coroner but a gentleman belonging to him would not let me in Hannah Francis I lodge in Mr Bradley s house up one pair of stairs I saw the deceas d beat by those men I was but a very little time by I was so frightned but cannot say I saw the Prisoner near enough him to strike him I saw the deceased every day and he never was well afterwards He was very much beat about the head and body and some very bad marks appeared about his neck after he was dead Was the others at the bar I could say something against them but as to the prisoner I cannot For the prisoner John Robertson I had some knowledge of the prisoner being a townsman hearing of his being taken into custody for this unhappy affair I went to the coroner s inquest to see what proofs were made against him I was present when the woman Gains was examined I did not observe the least obstruction made by the coroner There was one witness came when Mr Wright the coroner was summing up the evidence and that person was refused On his cross-examination he said whether the coroner laugh d or not he could not tell and that he thought upon the whole evidence that the matter was a trifling affair William Baker I am the surgeon I was sent for between one and two o clock on monday morning to the Brown Bear in Bow-street Covent-garden to the deceased He told me he had a pain over his shoulders breast and head It was very evident he had received sad blows on his head which was a good deal swelled his pulse was very quick I bled him very largely I thought he had been drinking I saw him again the next day between ten and eleven he was prodigiously better but still complain d of pain but I have seen people at a boxing-match beat a great deal more and done well again his eye was only a common black eye it was very much swelled I went before justice Fielding and said I did not think his Life was in danger and the affair was made up to another Q he says he thought him in but very little danger adding his head was swelled about as big as half my fist about the face I saw the deceased when dead the day the coroner attended his body There was nothing particular appeared that could be the cause of his death neither do I think his death was occasioned by what he received this 10th of December John Greenwood I was sent for to attend the deceas d after this action happened I come to him on Sunday morning about 8 o clock 8 days after he had been beat he complained of pains all over him he was short breath d and severish he said he had been out and got a great cold by being carried about and going to town and I bled him Q to the Prosecutrix Did you hear your husband complain of getting cold Prosecutrix No my Lord I did not Q to Greenwood Did you see any blood in the pot or corruption Greenwood I always looked in the pot there was a rough matter but not the least appearance of blood his head was tied up and as to his eye I did not see it needed any surgeon s business there was a little fullness on one eye more than the other I did not examine his head I laid two blisters on his arms and two on his back and had he been bruised as mentioned I must have seen it when I stripp d down his cloathes I saw no bruises The day after he was dead I saw him he was very black in those parts and down one side but this is common to persons who die a natural death I have seen it in children and grown persons I believe the catching of cold was the occasion of his death and not his being beat he complained of very short breath I talked with the deceased in conversation he said he had been beat a great deal worse than this and got well sooner John Richards I went to the deceased at Bow-street and he was sitting leaning with his head upon a table and seemed to be wet through it was a very rainy night The constable told me the surgeon had been there and said there was no danger and that he was willing to take six guineas of the gentlemen to make it up Ten Persons gave the Prisoner a good character and George Norris the foreman of the jury before the Coroner deposed that the witness Gains met with no obstruction at all as he saw and that the coroner took much pains to explain the nature of wilful murder at that time Guilty Manslaughter Branding See summary Whipping See summary
