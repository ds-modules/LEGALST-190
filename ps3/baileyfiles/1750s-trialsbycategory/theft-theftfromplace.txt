of beer I having but two silver tankards and they both in use at that time I ordered my servant to draw them a full pot of beer I had a club in the next room I came out for a pen and ink I saw all my company was gone into that room and they had left a silver tankard upon the table near the Prisoner who stood with his back towards it and the rest of his company were sitting by the fire the windows were shut up and I went back in the other room they went away at the door that leads to the street after this my girl called me and said the man is gone away with your tankard The other witness Warwick staid who told me he could not go away for that man meaning the Prisoner has took away something with him either pewter or silver like a tankard and likewise said he told Judith Dyke that he and she should come into trouble about it adding she made a pish at it I sent my young man one way and I went another but we could not find the prisoner or the woman Warwick still abode in the house

intelligence where she lived I went to her house and there was a man made answer and said she was not at home we could hear her whisper I went back again and we carried Warwick to New-prison my lodger said when we came back if I would go down to the woman she would open the door to me he was drinking with them that night in my house but he has hid himself and I cannot find him I fear the woman has sent him out of the way we went again and he knocked and she immediately let him in and the constable took charge of her the justice thought proper to admit her to bail I never saw the tankard since We searched Warwick to see if he had any knife or such instruments about him and I am sure he could not have the tankard about him the justice admitted Warwick to bail and upon Thursday evening he took the Prisoner and sent for me and he was secured they went away between 8 or 9 o clock Phillip Warwick On the 11th of Dec last as I was going along Cheapside I met the Prisoner I had not seen him
