I put down my hand and found I had lost my handkerchief then I felt for my watch and found that was gone I thought to myself that whoever had taken it they could not have had an opportunity to be got at any distance from me I immediately collar d the man on my right hand and another on my left and said they had got my watch I dragged them along to the centinel the centinel took hold of one and I dragg d the other under the gateway I call d for the Serjeant of the guard while I was doing that a servant of Sir Edward Hawkins who knew me came running up with my watch in his hand saying he saw

got your watch meaning him on the right The General had quitted his hold but immediately collar d him again and lugg d him forward in order to deliver him into the hands of the centinel Then I saw that man put his hand into either his coat or waistcoat-pocket and saw the chain hang out Then I saw the watch drop from his pocket and I pick d it up and gave it to the General I cannot swear to him for that was the only time I ever saw him Q Did you say to the General it was the old man that pick d his pocket Shorthouse No my Lord but the Remark the General made then was in that Hurry that it was the old man the other being a young man and not so big To me now the prisoner seems younger than at that time if he be the man Q How was that man cloath d Shorthouse He had on a blue coat and a
