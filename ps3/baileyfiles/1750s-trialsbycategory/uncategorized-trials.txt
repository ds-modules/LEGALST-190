making an assault upon William Salt and others and rescuing Thomas Jones otherwise Harper out of the Gatehouse Westminster January 20 1748 Mr Salt I am keeper of the Gatehouse Westminister on the 20th of January 1748 Thomas Jones otherwise Harper was committed to the Gatehouse by Gwyn Vaughan Esq for picking the honourable General St Clair s Pocket of a Gold Watch in Company with Thomas Allen the Commitment was read in Court on the same evening it was nearer eight o clock than seven a person knocked at the prison door it was opened to let them in there are two doors in the nature of folding doors with an upper and lower bolt one of the doors is always shut there is a cross bar with a lock to keep it shut When the Door was opened that is the folding part usually opened the turnkey was prevented closing it again a stick or something like it being thrust in betwixt the post and that in the same instant there was a great rushing to force it open there were seven or eight of us within we guessed there might be five or six of them thus we shov d force against force at length we closed the door but betwixt the time of closing it there were five pistols shot off from without one was fired the moment the door was opened which almost blinded us the balls and shot stick now in the wood within there is also a little wicket with four small iron bars in it to peep through The prisoner Mullins had just before been with Jones in the prison and the door of this wicket was that evening forced away and lost so that they without could have an opportunity of seeing us within through this hole or the door when opened two persons within were stabbed Patrick Henley and another man a prisoner who assisted us at the gate was run quite through the elbow No ball or shot touched any of us one of them made himself an evidence we have nobody but he and some circumstances corresponding with it to prove the identity of the prisoners it being dark and we almost blinded with their powder could not see them Jones crept out in this struggle at the door-way and they carried him ff in triumph and great shouting the next morning one of the soldiers which we sent for to guard the prison found a pistol which was burst in the string near the prison It was produced in court Q from Bowen Did not Brian say that at that time I was in a salivation Salt I believe Brian said Bowen was in a walking fall John Brian I have been acquainted with all the prisoners about two or three months before this affair at the Gatehouse happened We were often at the Fox in Drury-lane together on the 20th of January was twelve-months betwixt the hours of six and seven in the evening there was news brought to Field s house in Angel-Court Drury-lane by one John Folley to Tom Jones s companions that he was committed to the Gatehouse for picking the pocket of General St Clair of a gold watch there were then at that house John Bowen Garret Lawler Joseph Dowdle George Carter and myself in company George Carter is not yet taken we were drinking gin and beer we concluded to go and rescue Jones out we come out of Field s house in order to go down to York-buildings but we went first to the Fox in Drury-lane where we found the other four Norton otherwise Smith Uptebacke otherwise Mills Bob Carmitchell and James Quin we told them what we were going about they said they would go with us I had nothing but a broomstick with me nor did I know they had any instrument till we came to St Martin s Church-yard where we met Edward Mullings he told us he had been drinking with Jones we talked of the affair Mullings said the turnkey knew me and himself so we were not to go in adding he had been drinking with him and Jones for better than an hour there so it was concluded to put my stick in at the door to keep it open then fire and cut away and while our heads were all together this was concluded on says Bowen I have got a pistol and cutlass says a second I have another and so on Dowdle had a pistol and a hanger by his side Bowen the same Garret Lawler had a pistol Mullins had a pistol which burst in the barrel after which he threw it away it hurt his right hand Carmitchell had a knife and a stick in his hand the short end of a broomstick Smith had a hanger and a stick Bowen first knocked at the door and when it was open I put my stick between the door and the post we strove to get in but the Chain being fastened across the gate we could not we met with a strong resistance from within Harper got his body between the gate and the post and was squeezed Bowen stabbed somebody within in the time with his hanger betwixt the gate and gate-post over his head he got hold of Harper s arm and somebody within got hold of him behind but he was pulled out I heard a Man cry out he was stabb d afterwards the gate was shut there were about three pistols fired or more I was in much hurry and can t remember the number I saw Jones otherwise Harper after he was taken out as far as King-street Westminster we came all away together making a great noise about Whitehall we dispersed some one way and some another Q from Bowen Did not you say before the justice that I was all that time in a sallivation Brian I might say he was in a sort of a walking fall Q from Dowdle How was I arm d Brian With a pistol and cutlass Q from Smith otherwise Norton How was I armed Brian With a hanger and an oaken stick I knew him this three or four years I belonged to a privateer and we retook him and brought him to England Bowen My Lord Brian would never have discovered any thing had he not been taken up upon my information Patrick Henley I am under turnkey to Mr Salt at the Gatehouse when Jones was brought prisoner there that day about four o clock Mullins came to visit him about five they were about the yard backwards and forwards by themselves he staid there till about seven he asked me what o clock it was I said a little after seven he said blood and ouns let me go it is time for me to go and I let him out and this fray happened about eight o clock somebody come and knocked at the door it was opened to let them in there was a stick put in between the door and the post so that it could not shut too to lock the chain was on the door in the inside or they had all rushed in they forced on the outside we for our shoulders to force within against them in the mean time Harper got some way betwixt our legs and was pulled away from us as soon as the door was opened and they pushing without Harper bounced directly to the door the powder hurt our eyes there were five pistols fired I cannot tell how many there were without but we found by their thrusting against the door they were very strong there must be a great many Allen who came in with Jones was got to the door but we pulled him back again I was the first man that was wounded with a stab on my forehead he shewed the scar this was done through the wicket after they had got Jones out they made a terrible huzzaing after they had got him out I heard them say they would come back and pull down the goal there was a pistol burst which was found next morning under our gateway by one of the soldiers John Diamond I was turnkey to Mr Salt in January 1748 he went on and confirmed the last two witnesses Steven Macdaniel I know all the prisoners and they know me I saw them three or four days before this fray happened at the Fox in Drury-lane that house harboured nothing but thieves and highwaymen I know they used to go to the plough I dined along with Mullins Lawler and Brian the witness once at the Fox about a Week after this affair happened some of these belong to what they call themselves the Royal Family I am an Officer two of them Carter and Dowdle stopped me one night in Drury-lane and desired me to deliver my Money I said what I have got you may take very easy I drew my hanger and pinned one of them up against a Cheesemonger s pop Mr Maycroft was there at that time Mullings came in when we were at dinner with his hand tied up his thumb being hurt he said it was done by quarrelling he called Brian stagging dog the English of that is he thought if I wanted to take any one he would help me to him Mr Jones belonging to Bridewell and I took Brian Jones took a pistol out of his pocket who said don t use me ill I ll make myself an evidence and before Mr Fielding he confessed this affair I had some conversation about this with Bowen in the Press-yard in Newgate he sent me two letters about two months ago he said to me when I came there if he was sure he should be sent to the place were Brian then was he would come as an evidence about this rescue said I why did not you put it into your first Information then there would have been some credit in it I knew Jones who was rescued and have seen him along with Quin several times at the Fox Robert Maycrost I am an Officer and we generally make use of people that will answer our purposes I was once treating Brian with a tankard of beer and Mullins took an opportunity of quarrelling with him he imagined he was going to speak the truth he had a handkerchief tied about one hand and said he would tie one hand and fight Brian &c he said he had an injury done to his hand this was a few days after the advertisement of the rescue Bowen s defence William Merrychurch I live in Kent-street Surrey Bowen came into my house on the 13th of January and never went out till the 19th of February 1748 being ill he then was in a salivation Cross-Examined Q How came you to have a house of your own to lay people down in a salivation when at the

got a Pension Smith otherwise Norton s Defence I know nothing at all of the affair Elizabeth Lee Norton was at the same time at his uncle Jackson s chambers ill of a fever which took him the beginning of January 1748 and I was with him till the middle of February I believe he did not go out above a fortnight before I left him his uncle is an attorney in Barnard s-Inn No 3 up one pair of stairs his uncle is now confined to his chamber I saw him this morning very ill On her cross-examination she said the prisoner lay in a little room on the left hand coming in he had a blister there were green cheney curtains to his bed and a raised Tester and nothing in the room it being small but one chair by his bed Thomas Fox Smith was a patient of mine from the 4th or 5th of January a year ago to the 2d of February after he had a fever I bleeded and blistered him and several other attendances and he was not capable to get out of his bed for four weeks to my knowledge this was at Mr Jackson s

were blue curtains to his bed and that the room was on the right hand coming in there were a large table in the room and several chairs and a looking-glass and that he visited him once or twice a day

in the inn for the benefit of the air I have been acquainted with him this six or seven years and had used to call on my Wife the time she was nursing him On his cross-examination he said the prisoner lay on a room on the left hand a room big enough for half a dozen people to sit down by the side of the bed the curtains were blue and there was a table in the room The two last witnesses being known were asked how often they had been to insure bail at Westminster-hall who at first denied and at last both acknowledged they had Mary Jackson Norton lay at my husband s chambers the beginning of
