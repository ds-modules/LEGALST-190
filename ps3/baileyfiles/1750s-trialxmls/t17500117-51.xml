I read it, and found it answer'd very well with the situation of my master's affairs in the country, he being then very ill; he had not been in town for three weeks. I knew it was not his writing: but I thought he being ill, might have got some other person to write it for him. She produced another, which she said, came from her brother. The letters answering one another, I made no doubt about it, but paid her. She wrote the receipt, and went her way.</p>
