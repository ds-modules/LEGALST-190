            . I am a Collar-maker; the prisoner at the bar sold me the horse without shoes, with a bridle, saddle, and collar, for 10 s. 6 d. and, as Mr. Mason lives near me. I begg'd the favour of him to let him stand in his stable till I had an opportunity to kill him, and also told him, he might work him if he pleas'd: So he was found under his cart by the former witness. He was a poor object indeed, blind, swell'd legs, and had had the pole-evil.</p>

            . I keep the coach and horses in Swan-yard, facing Somerset-house; the prisoner at the bar brought this horse to my stable about the 26th or 27th of November; he staid there two Nights. Mr. Griffith came to my house the 29th to buy him; the prisoner and he did not then agree; the prisoner seem'd to have no money; he went out, and at his return, said he had sold the horse for a guinea and a half; and said he had not money to pay me for his keeping; but if I would go with him, I should be paid, when he went to deliver the horse. When I came to Mr. Griffith, I then found he had sold the horse but for half a guinea; out of which he paid me about 8 s. for the horse and himself.</p>
