I went from them, and I saw them following me: they came up with me, and began pulling me about, saying, I should go along with this and the other. I clapp'd my hand to my pocket, and miss'd my watch; I thought I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket, I laid hold on her, and the other ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not in liquor ?</p>
               <p>Stokes. I cannot say that I was quite drunk: I had been drinking. The whole affair was transacted in four minutes, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give another woman a dram at that place, that night, besides these two?</p>
               <p>Stokes. I might for ought I know; I cannot tell. I charged the Constable with her, she pleaded ignorance, as such people generally do. I never found my watch again.</p>
