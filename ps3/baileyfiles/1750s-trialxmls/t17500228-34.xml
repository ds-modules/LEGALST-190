I said no, I was in a hurry to go; we had drank once round out of a pint of porter ; I can't say which of them asked me to drink a dram, &amp;c.

Going to turn the corner of Fleet-lane, to go into the market, Roney asked me to let him carry the portmanteau, saying, it was heavy ; I said, no; this was between eleven and twelve o'clock at noon. Bastow laid hold round my neck, and gave me a squeeze to him, and turn'd my head the other way, while Roney took the portmanteau from my shoulder. Then I cry'd out, Thieves! and a mob got all round me, and I was in such a fright, I do not know how they got off. There came up a tradesman to me, and would have me search the King's-arms, thinking they were gone in there. I ran in, and after that into another house or two ; I could not find them. A gentleman told me, he saw them run up Fleet-street; I made the best of my way after them. A little boy came running along with me, and many people ran after me; we ran to the Temple-stairs. I asked the watermen, if they saw any such persons with a portmanteau ? there was one of them, just come from White-fryars, pointed out to a boat in the river, saying, there are the men. I told them, they had robb'd me of that portmanteau. Two boats put off immediately in pursuit of them; the boat that I was in landed at Moulston's dock, on the other side of the water ; we ran all the way by the water-side; the other boat kept down the water, and got to Bank-end as soon as the prisoners were got on the causeway.

            . I am a water-man; I ply at Temple-stairs ; the 27th of January, about eleven or twelve at noon, I was in Temple-lane, looking out for my business. Two boys came running down the lane, the last witness was one of them; who, in his fright, had not power to make me an answer when I ply'd them. When he recover'd himself, he asked, if we had not seen two men, describing their dress, with a portmanteau, come down to ask for a boat, &amp;c. saying, he had been robb'd by them, near the Fleet-market. A water-man, who had just landed his boat from White-fryars, said, I'll be hang'd if they are not the two men in that sculler, pointing to one upon the river. Then we put off two boats; two men took the two boys into one boat; the other boat had three men. We got the boys to sit in the bottom of the boat, for fear they should be seen by the prisoners. We push'd on shore at Moulston's-dock, while the other boat, with three men in it, kept in pursuit of them down the water. We ran, and just turning round by Horse-shoe-alley, the prisoners landed at Bank-end; who went round the corner talking together. I came up to them, and took hold of Roney with one hand, and the portmanteau, which was then on his shoulder, with the other. I asked him where he was going? he answer'd, d - n you, what is that to you ? I said, it was to me. Bastow took to his heels ; two of my consorts pursued him and took him in Deadman's-place. Patrick Roney made a push to get off, but was prevented in it. When we took them, they had such cloths on as the boy described.</p>

            . I had carried a fare from the Old Bargehouse to White-fryars, a man and a woman; they told me they should stay about two hours, and if they saw me they would go with me back; I rowed up to the Temple, thinking I had time enough to get another fare before they returned. I kept my eye upon White-friars causeway while I was at the Temple-stairs, there I saw a man in white coat come down, and another in a blue-grey coat after him, with a portmanteau on his shoulder. The boy came down asking after two such men, saying he had been robbed, &amp;c. Said I, I'll be hanged if they are not the two men, then we mann'd two boats. The rest as the former witnesses.</p>

            . I am a waterman, and ply at White-sriars. The two prisoners at the bar came down there, and I plyed them Jan 27. Bastow answered when I plyed, taking them into the boat. Said Bastow, pray lend my servant a hand into the boat, (meaning Roney with the portmanteau) which I did. I asked them where they would land? they said, row downwards; I said whereabouts? they said, Pull down. I said, on which side? they said, On the other side. When I got against Horseshoe-alley they bid me pull in there; I was got farther down towards Bank-end, so I landed them there. Bastow said, what must I give you? I said he paid me, and away they went. The other boat with the three watermen put in about three minutes after they were landed.</p>
               <p>Roney's Defence. I carried the portmanteau into the house in Fleet-lane. So I said I would carry it out, which I did. When I was got into the Market I lost the boy ; I was told he was gone up Fleet-street, so I ran up Fleet-street, then I was told he had taken water, and gone to the George in the Borough : I took boat to go there with the portmanteau to enquire for him, and they stopp'd me.</p>
