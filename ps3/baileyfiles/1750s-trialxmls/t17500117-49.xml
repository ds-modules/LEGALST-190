The Prisoner tore my waistcoat, and push'd my horse out of his step. I thought he had been drunk; I swore at him, but he went along, and hurry'd, swinging his hands, &amp;c. I did not think he had took my watch, 'till I came to the spurr inn in the borough. I met a friend, and went to drink a glass of wine there, going to pay for it, I missed my watch. I went home, and, as soon as I alighted from my horse, I went to the Maker, and had it advertised; and, from the 2d day of advertising it, I heard of it. I looked to see what o'clock it was, when I was at St. James's, and I saw the seal, with the anchor and the Key hung to it, as I was coming down Fish-street-hill.</p>

            . On the 18th of Oct. about 10 o'clock, a woman brought a watch to pawn. She asked 30 s. her Name is

            . She was committed along with the prisoner. I asked her whose it was? she told me, it was a gentleman's at the boot in Princes-street. I thought it might be taken as people came from the play, as the play was just done. I told the woman, I should stop it 'till she brought the owner. She went out, and brought the prisoner at the bar, who told me, it was his watch; then came in another man, and said, it is mine; so give me it, or he would hurt me; then, I said, I would not give it him without his first telling the name. Upon that, he said, he would not, but he would have the watch. It had a green string to it, and the place where a seal should hang, was fresh cut. Before I gave it back, I took the name and number of it upon a card; the maker's name, Sewil, No. 540, Senier. I gave the other man the watch again. So on the 20th of October, I saw a watch advertis'd, lost upon London-bridge, the 18th of October, the name as this. No. forgot. I thought proper to let the man know, that such a thing was offered to me, which I did. The prosecutor came over the water, and asked me, what sort of a man it was? I describ'd him; he said, by the description, it was the same man that did the robbery. Then we went to Justice Fielding's, and took out a warrant, and took up the woman; and we took out a warrant, by the descriptions of the two men; the woman was in custody 'till last sessions. I being attending here, and saw this person come to give evidence, I went home, and got the warrant, and had him secured.</p>
