When the Door was opened, that is, the folding part, usually opened, the turnkey was prevented closing it again; a stick, or something like it, being thrust in betwixt the post; and that in the same instant there was a great rushing to force it open; there were seven or eight of us within; we guessed there might be five or six of them; thus we shov'd force against force ; at length we closed the door; but betwixt the time of closing it there were five pistols shot off from without; one was fired the moment the door was opened, which almost blinded us; the balls and shot stick now in the wood within; there is also a little wicket with four small iron bars in it, to peep through. The prisoner Mullins had just before been with Jones in the prison, and the door of this wicket was that evening forced away and lost; so that they without could have an opportunity of seeing us within through this hole, or the door when opened; two persons within were stabbed,

Mr. Maycroft was there at that time. Mullings came in when we were at dinner, with his hand tied up, his thumb being hurt; he said it was done by quarrelling; he called Brian stagging dog, (the English of that is, he thought if I wanted to take any one, he would help me to him) Mr. Jones belonging to Bridewell, and I, took Brian; Jones took a pistol out of his pocket, who said, don't use me ill, I'll make myself an evidence, and before Mr. Fielding, he confessed this affair ; I had some conversation about this with Bowen, in the Press-yard in Newgate; he sent me two letters about two months ago; he said to me when I came there, if he was sure he should be sent to the place were Brian then was, he would come as an evidence about this rescue ; said I, why did not you put it into your first Information, then there would have been some credit in it; I knew Jones who was rescued, and have seen him along with Quin several times at the Fox.</p>
